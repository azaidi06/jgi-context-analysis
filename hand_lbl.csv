Despite its genetic similarity to the zoonotic pathogens B. abortus, B. melitensis and B. suis, B. ovis does not cause zoonotic disease. Genomic analysis of the type strain ATCC25840 revealed a high percentage of pseudogenes and increased numbers of transposable elements compared to the zoonotic Brucella species, suggesting that genome degradation has occurred concomitant with narrowing of the host range of B. ovis. The absence of genomic island 2, encoding functions required for lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis, as well as inactivation of genes encoding urease, nutrient uptake and utilization, and outer membrane proteins may be factors contributing to the avirulence of B. ovis for humans. A 26.5 kb region of B. ovis ATCC25840 Chromosome II was absent from all the sequenced human pathogenic Brucella genomes, but was present in all of 17 B. ovis isolates tested and in three B. ceti isolates, suggesting that this DNA region may be of use for differentiating B. ovis from other Brucella spp. This is the first genomic analysis of a non-zoonotic Brucella species.

PMC2677664,Introduction,Introduction,NC_003317,0,1,0,,"""Sequencing of B. melitensis, and B. suis genomes demonstrated a high level of similarity between the two genomes, with over 90% of the genes having more than 98–100% nucleotide identity [19].""","  Introduction  Although previous studies have supported the notion of Brucella as a monospecies genus with different biotypes [1], it is still largely accepted that the genus Brucella is divided into six species, named according to their preferential hosts. Each one of the species is host-adapted, but not host-restricted [2]–[4]. Four of the six Brucella species, namely B. melitensis, B. abortus, B. suis, and B. canis, are capable of causing human disease. B. melitensis and B. suis are the most pathogenic, whereas B. abortus is considered of moderate pathogenicity, and B. canis is considered of low pathogenicity for humans. There are no reports of human infections with B. ovis or B. neotomae  [3]. In addition to the six classical Brucella species, Brucella has also been isolated from marine mammals, and two species, B. pinnipedialis and B. ceti have been proposed [5]. Brucella isolates from marine mammals can cause human infections, with one reported case of infection due to laboratory exposure [6], and two reported cases of natural infections resulting in neurological disease [7].  Brucella ovis was initially recognized in the beginning of the 1950's in New Zealand and Australia as a bacterial agent associated with epididymitis and abortion in sheep [8]. Since then this organism has been isolated in several countries [9], and is considered one of the most important causes of ovine infertility, with a significant economic impact on the sheep industry [10]. B. ovis has a worldwide distribution in areas where sheep are economically significant, with the exception of the Great Britain [9]. The prevalence in herds ranges from 9.1 to 46.7% [11], and the seroprevalence within positive herds varies between 2.1 to 67% [11]–[14].  B. ovis is stably rough, and it is one of the two classical Brucella species that do not have zoonotic potential. In sheep, the organism causes either clinical or sub-clinical chronic infections characterized by epididymitis, orchitis, male infertility, and occasionally abortion in pregnant ewes [15]. Sexually mature rams are more susceptible than young males [16]. However, B. ovis infection may affect males as young as 4 months old [9]. Natural transmission apparently occurs through mucosal membranes, and venereal transmission is significant when a female previously mated with an infected male copulates with a second susceptible male during the same period of estrus [17]. Upon invasion through mucosal membranes, B. ovis initially resides in local lymph nodes, which is followed by bacteremia and finally colonization of the genital tract around 30 days post infection [18]. The factors defining the genital tropism of this organism remain unknown.  Sequencing of B. melitensis, and B. suis genomes demonstrated a high level of similarity between the two genomes, with over 90% of the genes having more than 98–100% nucleotide identity [19]. Furthermore, comparison between these two species resulted in the identification of only 32 and 43 genes that were unique to B. melitensis and B. suis, respectively. This level of variability is remarkably low even when compared to variations between serotypes within the same bacterial species such as in serotypes Typhi and Typhimurium of Samonella enterica  [20]. More recently, the complete genome sequence of B. abortus (strains 9–941 and 2308) became available confirming the striking similarity both among different species of Brucella and within the species B. abortus  [21], [22]. Comparisons between these three Brucella species revealed more than 94% identity at the nucleotide level. In addition, comparisons between the genomes of the two B. abortus strains that have been sequenced (9–941 and 2308) resulted in identification of only a small number of strain-specific deletions and polymorphisms [21]. The genetic similarity among Brucella species has been confirmed by whole genome hybridizations [23]. Together these studies support the original hybridization studies performed more than 20 years ago suggesting that Brucella is a monospecific genus from the genetic point of view [1]. Considering the high level of identity among Brucella species pathogenic to humans, the comparison of those species with a Brucella lacking the potential to cause human infections may bring new insights into host specificity and pathogenesis. In this study we present the genome analysis of the rough non-human-pathogen Brucella ovis and compare its genome with those of the zoonotic Brucella spp. Our analysis focused on two sets of genomic features (i) deletions and gene degradation that could potentially result in loss of virulence factors important for infection of hosts other than sheep, and (ii) B. ovis-specific genes that could contribute to genital tract tropism or cause a reduction in virulence for non-ovine hosts.

Physical and sequencing gaps were closed using a combination of primer walking, generation and sequencing of transposon-tagged libraries of large-insert clones, and multiplex PCR [79]. Identification of putative protein-encoding genes and annotation of the genome were performed as previously described [24]. An initial set of genes predicted to encode proteins was identified with GLIMMER [80]. Genes consisting of fewer than 30 codons and those containing overlaps were eliminated. Frame shifts and point mutations were corrected or designated ‘authentic.’ Functional assignment, identification of membrane-spanning domains, and determination of paralogous gene families were performed as previously described [24]. Sequence alignments and phylogenetic trees were generated using the methods described previously [24].  Trinucleotide composition  Distribution of all 64 trinucleotides (3-mers) was determined, and the 3-mer distribution in 1,000-bp windows that overlapped by half their length (500 bp) across the genome was computed. For each window, we computed the χ2 statistic on the difference between its 3-mer content and that of the whole chromosome. A large value for indicates the 3-mer composition in this window is different from the rest of the chromosome (minimum of two standard deviations). Probability values for this analysis are based on assumptions that the DNA composition is relatively uniform throughout the genome, and that 3-mer composition is independent. Because these assumptions may be incorrect, we prefer to interpret high χ2 values as indicators of regions on the chromosome that appear unusual and demand further scrutiny.  Comparative genomics  The B. ovis ATCC25840 genome was compared to the genomes of B. suis 1330, B. abortus 2308, B. abortus 9-941, and B. melitensis 16M (PATRIC), at the nucleotide level by suffix tree analysis using MUMmer [81], and the predicted B. ovis CDSs were compared with the gene sets from the other sequenced Brucella genomes by BLAST and by HMM paralogous family searches, as previously described [82].  Analysis of the B. ovis-specific island  Genomic DNA from B. ovis strains and other Brucella species (B. melitensis, B. suis, B. abortus, B. canis, B. neotomae, and B. pinnipedialis) were subjected to PCR amplification of 12 target sequences within the B. ovis-specific island. PCR reactions were performed using 13 µL of a commercial PCR mix (PCR Supermix, Invitrogen, USA), 0.75 µL of a 25 µM solution of each primer (Supplementary Table S1), and 1 µL of DNA (100 to 500 ng per reaction). Cycling parameters were denaturation at 95°C for 5 minutes; 35 cycles of denaturation (95°C for 1 min seconds), annealing (55°C for 1 min), and extension (72°C for 1 min); and a final extension at 72°C for 5 min. PCR products were resolved by agarose gel electrophoresis.

['Mention' included because they throw up summary stats from NCBI for all of these genomes]","  Results and Discussion  General features of the B. ovis genome  The B. ovis type strain ATCC25840 (also known as 63/290 or NCTC10512) used for sequencing was isolated from a sheep in Australia in 1960 [8]. The genome of this strain consists of two circular chromosomes of 2,111,370 bp (Chromosome I; NCBI Accession Number NC_009505) and 1,164,220 bp (Chromosome II; NCBI Accession Number NC_009504), which are predicted to encode a total of 2890 proteins, 1928 on ChrI and 962 on ChrII (Table 1). Features of the B. ovis genome are summarized in Table 1. Comparison with the sequenced genomes of B. suis (GenBank Accession numbers NC_004310 and NC_004311) [24], B. abortus (GenBank Accession numbers NC_007618 and NC_007624) [21], [22] and B. melitensis 16M (GenBank Accession numbers NC_003317 and NC_003318) [19] shows a large degree of conservation, particularly in the % G+C content and size of the chromosomes. This comparison also revealed several species-specific differences, including regions missing from B. ovis relative to the other sequenced Brucella genomes and genes unique to B. ovis. These differences are listed in Table 1 and Figures 1–2, and are discussed below.  10.1371/journal.pone.0005519.g001  Figure 1  Whole genome alignment of sequenced Brucella strains.  The five genomes were compared to each other by using COG, BLAST and HMM analyses. Each genome is colored with a gradient that ranges from yellow (nucleotide 1) to blue (end). Differences in color between a reference sequence (the bottom colored line in each set) and the other genomes indicate conserved protein-coding regions that have been rearranged. Uncolored segments denote coding regions in which no conserved genes were detected. The curves on top of each panel represent the nucleotide composition (Χ2 analysis) (see   Materials and Methods  ) of the reference strain of the panel, and peaks indicate regions of atypical composition.  10.1371/journal.pone.0005519.g002  Figure 2  Map of the B. ovis-specific island on Chromosome II, which resembles a composite transposon.

Comparative best-match blastp searches identified 2282 annotated proteins in B. ovis that are shared with B. suis, B. melitensis and B. abortus, 79% of the annotated proteome. Nonetheless, this analysis suggested that the B. ovis genome lacks 675, 610 and 539 protein coding genes annotated in B. suis, B. melitensis and B. abortus 2308, respectively (Table S3). To determine whether these genes are truly absent from the B. ovis genome they were compared to the B. ovis chromosomal sequences using blastn searches. Interestingly, good matches were found for 64, 125 and 18 genes thought to be lacking in B. ovis in the genomes of B. suis, B. melitensis and B. abortus 2308, respectively (Table S3). There are several possible reasons for these genes not being highlighted as shared using comparative best-match blastp searches, e.g., they may be pseudogenes in B. ovis and therefore, not part of the predicted proteome, they may be the products of duplications where only one duplication product is matched in best match searches or differences in gene annotation between the strains resulted in these sequences not being annotated as a protein coding gene in B. ovis. In total only 33 annotated protein coding genes in B. ovis are unique to this species.  Genomic rearrangements  Gradient figures were used to compare the chromosomes of B. ovis with those of the other sequenced Brucella genomes. No large inversions or rearrangements were observed in the B. ovis genome compared to the sequenced genomes of B. suis or B. melitensis (Figure 1).  Genomic deletions  Chromosome I  Four deletions of 4 kb or larger were identified in the B. ovis genome, compared to its closest relative, B. suis. Chromosome I lacks a 15 kb region that encompasses B. suis BR0966-BR0987. Interestingly, in B. suis, this region is inserted into the sequence of tRNAgly and is adjacent to a phage integrase-like gene, features suggestive of horizontal gene transfer. This region contains the wboA glycosyl transferase gene, shown to be essential for lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis [25], and a second glycosyl transferase, as well as several hypothetical proteins. The lack of the two glycosyl transferases likely contributes to the rough LPS phenotype of B. ovis. These findings were in agreement with previous reports by Vizcaino et al and Rajashekara et al [23], [26] showing the absence of these genes from B. ovis.  A second deletion on Chromosome I of 7745 bp encompasses BR1078-BR1083. This island in B. suis contains three hypothetical genes and two site specific recombinases and is flanked by two tRNA-Leu genes, of which one remains in B. ovis. A smaller deletion of 3954 bp on Chromosome I has led to loss of two genes (BR1852-BR1853) encoding a transcriptional regulator and a protein predicted to be a branched chain amino acid permease. This deletion is also associated with transposable elements, as these two genes in B. suis are flanked by copies of IS2020  [27], one of which remains in B. ovis.  Chromosome II  The 44.5 kb island in B. suis (BRA1074-BRA1113; [28]), containing four predicted ABC transport systems and three transcriptional regulators, is absent from the B. ovis genome. The presence of two copies of IS1239 flanking two pseudogenes in B. ovis suggests that this is the result of a loss of this region by recombination.  The 18.3 kb IncP island on B. suis Chromosome II containing BRA0362-BRA0379, previously reported to be present in B. suis biovars 1–4, B. canis, B. neotomae, and marine mammal isolates but missing in B. melitensis  [24], [28], is also absent from the B. ovis genome, as reported by Lavigne and colleagues [28].  Unique genomic regions  Chromosome II, contains an island of 26.5 kb (BOV_A0482-BOV_A0515) with structure suggestive of a composite transposon (Fig. 2). This island likely overlaps the B. ovis-specific 21-kb SpeI fragment of the small chromosome identified previously by genome mapping [29]. Proteins encoded on the island include transposases, an ABC transporter, a putative hemagglutinin, and several hypothetical proteins. This region is present in 17/17 B. ovis strains tested, suggesting a high level of conservation within the species (Supplementary Table S2). Interestingly, the predicted product of BOV_A0497 exhibits similarity to antitoxins of toxin-antitoxin maintenance systems [30], suggesting a possible selective pressure for maintenance of this genetic island in B. ovis. Genome sequence data and analysis of the island by PCR showed that this region is absent from the genomes of B. suis, B. abortus, B. melitensis, B. canis and B. neotomae (Table 2), suggesting initially that it may be specific to B. ovis. However, we detected this island in three marine isolates of Brucella from captive bottlenose dolphins [31], [32]. The protein coding genes within this unique region constitute the majority of the unique protein coding genes in B. ovis (Supplementary Table S3).  10.1371/journal.pone.0005519.t002  Table 2  Detection of the B. ovis genomic island in Brucella species  Species  ORF  Brucella ovis  B. melitensis  B. abortus  B. suis  B. canis  B. neotomae  B. ceti (Muu)  B. ceti (Cudo)  B. ceti (Nor)  NTC1  A0492  +  −  −  −  −  −  +  +  +  −  A0495  +  −  −  −  −  −  +  +  +  −  A0496  +  −  −  −  −  −  +  +  +  −  A0497  +  −  −  −  −  −  +  +  +  −  A0500  +  −  −  −  −  −  +  +  +  −  A0502  +  −  −  −  −  −  +  +  +  −  A0503  +  −  −  −  −  −  +  +  +  −  A0504  +  −  −  −  −  −  +  +  +  −  A0505  +  −  −  −  −  −  +  +  +  −  A0506  +  −  −  −  −  −  +  +  +  −  A0511  +  −  −  −  −  −  +  +  +  −  A0512  +  −  −  −  −  −  +  +  +  −  BR06152  +  +  +  +  +  +  +  +  +  −  1  NTC, no template control  2  Positive control for amplification reaction  Transposable elements  The genome of B. ovis contains 38 complete copies of IS711, confirming previous estimates obtained by hybridization [33]. 25 of the copies are located in Chromosome I, and 13 in Chromosome II. Interestingly, several of these copies appear to be expanded clonally, suggesting that they could be active in B. ovis. In 17 cases, IS711 is inserted in copies of a repeated sequence of the BruRS family [34]. Five of the IS711 copies appear to disrupt genes, which could be a contributing factor to the general process of genome degradation observed in B. ovis. A case of special interest is the B. ovis-specific island (see above), where a 25 kb region between two copies of IS711 in B. ovis is absent in all the other sequenced species, suggestive of either deletion by recombination between the two copies in the other Brucella species, or of acquisition of the region with duplication of IS711.  Pseudogenes  It has been proposed that the unique complement of pseudogenes in each of the Brucella species may contribute to their differing degrees of infectivity and host preference [21], [22]. Interestingly B. abortus, which is less virulent for humans than B. suis and B. melitensis, has a greater number of pseudogenes (316) than B. suis 1330 (62) or B. melitensis 16M (163) (Table 1). Similar to B. abortus, the B. ovis genome contains a large number of pseudogenes with 244 identified. The small chromosome contains more pseudogenes (125; 11.3%) than the large chromosome (119; 5.7%) (Table 1). Of the 244 B. ovis pseudogenes, 40 are hypothetical or conserved hypothetical genes, 62 have predicted transport functions, 23 are defective transposases, and 14 are predicted to have regulatory functions. The finding that some pseudogenes in the B. melitensis flagellar region encode full-length proteins raises the question of whether some pseudogenes in B. ovis may also be functional [35].  Metabolism  Urease  Based on biotyping, B. ovis is urease-negative. However it contains the two urease clusters described in all the other sequenced Brucella genomes. Urease has been reported to be important for the ability of B. abortus  [36] and B. suis  [37] to survive passage through the stomach in the mouse model of infection. The importance of urease for oral infection is consistent with a lack of human infections observed with B. ovis, despite identification of this organism in the milk of infected ewes [38]. The ure1 cluster is the only one showing urease activity at least in B. abortus, B. melitensis, and B. suis  [36], [37], while the ure2 does not have any demonstrable urease activity. The ure1 cluster of B. ovis contains several point mutations that are predicted to result in conserved changes shared by at least one other urease positive species. However, UreC1 contains a 30 bp deletion that would cause a loss of 10 amino acids in UreC1. Although all the residues described to be important for enzymatic activity of UreC1 are conserved [39], this deletion must render the urease inactive. Moreover, complementation with the ureC1 gene from B. melitensis (Sangari, unpublished results) results in urease activity. Regarding the ure2 cluster, ureF2 (BOV_1316) and ureT (BOV_1319) are pseudogenes, while the remaining genes are conserved, suggesting that this cluster could encode an unknown activity.  Sugar metabolism  B. ovis is defective in oxidative metabolism of arabinose, galactose, ribose, xylose, glucose and erythritol [40]. Analysis of the genome sequence reveals a possible basis for these metabolic defects in B. ovis relative to the human pathogenic Brucella species. Several putative sugar transporters predicted to be functional in other Brucella species appear to be inactivated by frameshifts, point mutations or gene degradation in B. ovis. Further, pckA encoding phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (BOV_2009) is inactivated by frameshift, which would affect the gluconeogenesis pathway and the ability of B. ovis to utilize pyruvate, amino acids, or glycerol as carbon sources.  Erythritol  Erythritol is the preferred carbon source of B. abortus  [41], [42]. Erythritol is metabolized in Brucella by the enzymes encoded in the eryABCD operon[43] Moreover, it has been recently described that the carbohydrate transport system located upstream of the ery operon constitutes the erythritol transport system in Rhizobium leguminosarum bv. Viciae  [44], and that the operon immediately downstream also forms part of the erythritol catabolic pathway. Microarray experiments have revealed that these three operons are regulated by erythritol in B. abortus, reinforcing that the three clusters participate in erythritol catabolism (Sangari et al, unpublished). B. ovis does not oxidize erythritol, and it is not inhibited by its presence in the growth media. This is reflected in the genome by the presence of a stop codon in eryA (BOV_A0811) and a frameshift in eryD (BOV_A0814) that render them pseudogenes. In addition two genes of the putative ABC erythritol transport system, eryF and eryG (BOV_A805 and BOV_A806)) carry mutations that render them pseudogenes (a 2 bp deletion resulting in an premature stop codon). The mutation in eryD could have an effect in the over expression of all genes of the ery system. On the contrary, mutations in the transport genes and in eryA block the entry of erythritol in the cell and its phosphorylation, avoiding the accumulation of toxic intermediates and the depletion of ATP observed in the vaccine strain S19 [45]. The accumulation of mutations in these two clusters suggest that they may no longer be needed by B. ovis. The third cluster is intact, and the enzymes use substrates that are central (or core) carbohydrate metabolites such as dihydroxyacetone phosphate, glyceraldehydes-3-phosphate, and other three carbon compounds that can be produced after decarboxylation of erythritol and its derivatives.  While it has been hypothesized that erythritol may serve as a carbon source during growth of B. abortus, B. suis, and B. melitensis in the placenta of their natural hosts, an analysis of deletion mutants in these models has not been reported. However, the lower incidence of abortion in sheep flocks infected with B. ovis compared to B. melitensis correlates with the inability of B. ovis to use erythritol as a carbon source. Mutants in eryB and eryC have been described to have a limited ability to grow in macrophages [46]. This limitation may well contribute to the limited virulence of B. ovis.  Glucose and Galactose  Unlike B. melitensis, B. abortus and B. suis, B. ovis is unable to grow on glucose or galactose as a primary carbon source [40]. Analysis of genes involved in uptake and utilization of these carbon sources reveals that B. ovis gluP (BOV_A0172), encoding a glucose/galactose transporter [47] is a pseudogene. B. abortus gluP mutants have a reduced ability to persist in the spleens of mice [48], suggesting that the ability to utilize these carbon sources may be important for systemic persistence of the human pathogenic Brucella species. However B. suis also lacks GluP and is able to oxidize glucose and galactose, suggesting that additional functions are lacking in B. ovis that contribute to utilization of these carbon sources. Several predicted sugar ABC transporters (BOV_1299-BOV1301, BOV_A0278-BOV_A0282, BOV_A0645-BOV_A0648 and BOV_A1083-BOV_A1086) of unknown specificity contain pseudogenes, which may potentially reduce the ability of B. ovis to take up glucose and galactose.  Ribose  Two components, a permease and an ATP binding protein of a putative ribose ABC transport system (BOV_A0936-BOV_A0937) are pseudogenes in B. ovis, suggesting that the inability of B. ovis to utilize ribose as a sole carbon source may be the result of a reduced capacity to take up ribose from the growth medium. Similarly, a periplasmic binding protein and an ATP binding protein of a predicted ABC transporter for xylose (BOV_A1055-BOVA1056) contain frameshifts, which may underlie the inability of B. ovis to utilize xylose [40].  Oxidase phenotype  B. ovis is the only Brucella species with a negative oxidase phenotype. Oxidase phenotype depends on the activity of cytochrome C oxidase which in B. suis is encoded by at least 7 genes, four of them organized in one operon, BR0363-BR0360 (ccoNOQP), together with BR0467 (coxB), encoding cytochrome c oxidase, subunit II, BR0468 (coxA) encoding cytochrome c oxidase, subunit I and BR0472 (coxC) encoding cytochrome c oxidase, subunit III. In B. ovis, the operon ccoNOQP (BOV_0376-BOV_0379), encoding the cb type cytochrome c oxidase is well conserved, except the gene ccoO (BOV_0378), which contains a frameshift generated by deletion of an A near its 5′ end, is a pseudogene. The B. ovis coxB gene (BOV_0473) contains a frameshift that very probably inactivates the gene, while coxA (BOV_0474) differs only in two residues with the B. suis product. The last 6 amino acids of coxC (BOV_0478) are lost as result of a short deletion (56 bp) that fuses this product with the next, apparently unrelated Orf. A short repeated sequence (GGGGCGGC) at both ends of the deletion seems to be responsible for this rearrangement. These genomic differences may be responsible for the oxidase negative phenotype of B. ovis.  Nitrogen metabolism  Several genes encoded in the B. suis genome with inferred functions in nitrogen metabolism are not predicted to be functional in the B. ovis genome. The genes norB (BOV_A0225), encoding the large subunit of nitric oxide reductase, and nosX (BOV_A0256), a gene of unknown function in the operon encoding nitric oxide synthase, are pseudogenes in B. ovis. The third gene, narK (BOV_A0276), encoding a nitrite extrusion protein, is degenerate, as was found in the B. melitensis and B. abortus 2308 genomes [21]. Nitric oxide reductase is required for survival and persistence of B. suis in mice [49], suggesting that lack of this activity in B. ovis may contribute to its restricted tissue tropism and host range.  A locus that contributes to growth of E. coli on aspartate as a nitrogen source, xanthine dehydrogenase (BOV_0365-BOV_0367;  [50]) contains a pseudogene in B. ovis, suggesting a further defect in nitrogen metabolism. Further, this locus could function in salvage pathways for purine nucleotides, which could contribute to nitrogen metabolism. A correlation between a defective purine nucleotide salvage pathway and reduced ability of B. ovis to survive intracellularly would be consistent with the importance of purine biosynthetic pathways for full virulence of B. abortus and B. melitensis  [51], [52]. Further, a homolog of Sinorhizobium meliloti fixI (BOV_0373), encoding an cation pump involved in symbiotic nitrogen fixation [53], is inactivated by a point mutation in the B. ovis genome. As the function of the fixGHI genes in Brucella spp. has not been determined, the biological significance of this gene inactivation for B. ovis is currently unknown.  Host-pathogen interactions  Lipopolysaccharide  B. ovis is known to have a rough LPS phenotype, which given the critical role of O-antigen in pathogenicity of B. abortus, B. suis and B. melitensis, likely contributes to its reduced pathogenicity for laboratory animals compared to other Brucella spp. [8], [54], [55]. As mentioned above, the wboA gene is missing from B. ovis, as well as a second, genetically linked glycosyltransferase. Pseudogenes with a possible function in LPS biosynthesis include a glycosyltransferase (BOV_A0475), an LpxA family acetyltransferase (BOV_A0367) and a putative undecaprenylphosphate alpha-N-acetylglucosamine transferase (BOV_A0371) of which the latter may also be involved in murein biosynthesis. While it is known that B. ovis LPS has a higher affinity for antimicrobial peptides than that of B. abortus, it is unknown whether differences in LPS structure compared to smooth Brucella species affect the interaction of B. ovis LPS with toll-like receptors of the innate immune system [56], [57].  Type IV secretion system (T4SS)  The T4SS, encoded by virB1-virB12, is an essential virulence factor in B. abortus, B. suis, and B. melitensis  [48], [58]–[60]. The genes virB1-VirB12 are intact in the B. ovis genome, suggesting that this system is functional. Further, the gene encoding its transcriptional activator VjbR (BOVA_0110;  [61]) is conserved. These findings are consistent with the detection of VirB5 and VirB8 expression in B. ovis  [62]. Two co-regulated genes identified as encoding T4SS substrates, vceA (BOV_1577) and vceC (BOV_1003) are present in B. ovis, however it is currently unknown whether there may be additional T4SS effectors in other Brucella spp. that are absent from B. ovis  [63]. A recent report showing that B. ovis strain PA is able to replicate in macrophages and HeLa cells at a rate similar to that of B. abortus suggests that its T4SS is functional [64].  Autotransporter proteins  Four predicted autotransporters have been identified in the sequenced Brucella genomes. Each of the sequenced Brucella genomes is predicted to encode a different combination of autotransporters [21], suggesting that none of these four proteins is essential for virulence, but that different combinations of autotransporters may contribute to observed differences in tissue tropism and host preference. The B. ovis genome is predicted to encode three functional autotransporters, corresponding to B. suis BR0072, BRA0173 and BRA1148, (BOV_0071, BOV_A0152 and BOV_A1053) while the fourth gene, BOV_1937, corresponding to BR2013, is degenerate. These proteins show a range in similarity (at the amino acid level) to their B. suis counterparts, from 99% between BRA1148 and BOV_A1053, to 86% similarity between BOV_A0152 and BRA0173. BR2013, designated omaA, is a pseudogene in both B. abortus and B. melitensis, and was noted to have a polymorphism with unknown functional effects in the genome of vaccine strain B. abortus 19 [65]. Since the product of this gene has been shown to contribute to persistence of B. suis in mice [66], it is possible that lack of a functional OmaA autotransporter in B. ovis may contribute to its limited tissue tropism and host range. However, the finding that all four autotransporter genes are predicted to be pseudogenes in B. melitensis, shows that they are not absolutely required for infectivity and transmission.  Immunomodulatory functions  In addition to the T4SS, several genes implicated in modulation of the immune response by Brucella spp., are well-conserved in B. ovis ATCC25840. These include btp1, encoding the TIR domain protein, an inhibitor of TLR2 signaling, the B cell mitogen encoded by prpA, and cyclic β-glucan synthase [67]–[70].  Outer membrane proteins  The two component regulator BvrR/BvrS, which has been shown to be a master regulator of many virulence-associated functions [71], [72], appears intact in B. ovis. However, a putative envZ osmosensor (BOV_A0412) is a pseudogene. Two genes shown to encode outer membrane proteins in other Brucella species omp2a (BOV_0632  [73]) and omp31 (BOV_1565; [74]), contain point mutations in B. ovis. For Omp31, the point mutation is predicted to lead to a truncation in the protein. It was found previously that the outer membrane of B. ovis is more susceptible to cationic peptides than a rough B. abortus mutant [56], suggesting that together with the defects in LPS biosynthesis discussed above, these defects in outer membrane components may further compromise the cell envelope stability of B. ovis making it less able to survive environmental stresses.  Perspective  The unique biology of Brucella ovis compared to the human pathogenic species appears to be in part the result of genome degradation. Worldwide, the majority of human brucellosis cases occur via ingestion of contaminated dairy products. B. ovis is not known to cause human infection, despite worldwide consumption of unpasteurized sheep's milk, where B. ovis has been detected [38]. Oral transmission, although feasible in experimental conditions, does not appear to be one of the main routes of infection for B. ovis, whereas passive venereal transmission via the ewe is the most important one [75]. This suggests that this species has lost the ability to infect via the oral route. One genomic change that may contribute to this loss of oral infectivity is the loss of an important virulence factor, urease, that is required for survival of stomach acidity by Brucella spp [36], [37]. Urease has also been shown to contribute to the establishment of Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae infection in pigs through the respiratory tract [76]. If this mechanism is also operative in Brucella spp., then it is possible that B. ovis is also deficient in establishing infections not only by the digestive route but also via aerosol inhalation, which are the two main routes of infection by human pathogenic Brucella spp. Additional genes that seem to be non-functional in B. ovis could also contribute to reduce the number of transmission routes compared to other Brucella species. A characteristic of B. ovis is its tropism for the ovine male genital tract, which presents as epididymo-orchitis [8]. Since other Brucella species, especially B. melitensis are known to cause epididymo-orchitis in human patients [77], the predilection of B. ovis to cause epididymo-orchitis in rams likely represents a loss of functions required to target to other tissues. However, due to the large number of genes in the B. ovis genome with unknown function, a gain of functions that allow for increased colonization of the male genital tract cannot be ruled out based on the genome sequence.

Each one of the species is host-adapted, but not host-restricted [2]–[4]. Four of the six Brucella species, namely B. melitensis, B. abortus, B. suis, and B. canis, are capable of causing human disease. B. melitensis and B. suis are the most pathogenic, whereas B. abortus is considered of moderate pathogenicity, and B. canis is considered of low pathogenicity for humans. There are no reports of human infections with B. ovis or B. neotomae  [3]. In addition to the six classical Brucella species, Brucella has also been isolated from marine mammals, and two species, B. pinnipedialis and B. ceti have been proposed [5]. Brucella isolates from marine mammals can cause human infections, with one reported case of infection due to laboratory exposure [6], and two reported cases of natural infections resulting in neurological disease [7].  Brucella ovis was initially recognized in the beginning of the 1950's in New Zealand and Australia as a bacterial agent associated with epididymitis and abortion in sheep [8]. Since then this organism has been isolated in several countries [9], and is considered one of the most important causes of ovine infertility, with a significant economic impact on the sheep industry [10]. B. ovis has a worldwide distribution in areas where sheep are economically significant, with the exception of the Great Britain [9]. The prevalence in herds ranges from 9.1 to 46.7% [11], and the seroprevalence within positive herds varies between 2.1 to 67% [11]–[14].  B. ovis is stably rough, and it is one of the two classical Brucella species that do not have zoonotic potential. In sheep, the organism causes either clinical or sub-clinical chronic infections characterized by epididymitis, orchitis, male infertility, and occasionally abortion in pregnant ewes [15]. Sexually mature rams are more susceptible than young males [16]. However, B. ovis infection may affect males as young as 4 months old [9]. Natural transmission apparently occurs through mucosal membranes, and venereal transmission is significant when a female previously mated with an infected male copulates with a second susceptible male during the same period of estrus [17]. Upon invasion through mucosal membranes, B. ovis initially resides in local lymph nodes, which is followed by bacteremia and finally colonization of the genital tract around 30 days post infection [18]. The factors defining the genital tropism of this organism remain unknown.  Sequencing of B. melitensis, and B. suis genomes demonstrated a high level of similarity between the two genomes, with over 90% of the genes having more than 98–100% nucleotide identity [19]. Furthermore, comparison between these two species resulted in the identification of only 32 and 43 genes that were unique to B. melitensis and B. suis, respectively. This level of variability is remarkably low even when compared to variations between serotypes within the same bacterial species such as in serotypes Typhi and Typhimurium of Samonella enterica  [20]. More recently, the complete genome sequence of B. abortus (strains 9–941 and 2308) became available confirming the striking similarity both among different species of Brucella and within the species B. abortus  [21], [22]. Comparisons between these three Brucella species revealed more than 94% identity at the nucleotide level. In addition, comparisons between the genomes of the two B. abortus strains that have been sequenced (9–941 and 2308) resulted in identification of only a small number of strain-specific deletions and polymorphisms [21]. The genetic similarity among Brucella species has been confirmed by whole genome hybridizations [23]. Together these studies support the original hybridization studies performed more than 20 years ago suggesting that Brucella is a monospecific genus from the genetic point of view [1]. Considering the high level of identity among Brucella species pathogenic to humans, the comparison of those species with a Brucella lacking the potential to cause human infections may bring new insights into host specificity and pathogenesis. In this study we present the genome analysis of the rough non-human-pathogen Brucella ovis and compare its genome with those of the zoonotic Brucella spp. Our analysis focused on two sets of genomic features (i) deletions and gene degradation that could potentially result in loss of virulence factors important for infection of hosts other than sheep, and (ii) B. ovis-specific genes that could contribute to genital tract tropism or cause a reduction in virulence for non-ovine hosts.

Physical and sequencing gaps were closed using a combination of primer walking, generation and sequencing of transposon-tagged libraries of large-insert clones, and multiplex PCR [79]. Identification of putative protein-encoding genes and annotation of the genome were performed as previously described [24]. An initial set of genes predicted to encode proteins was identified with GLIMMER [80]. Genes consisting of fewer than 30 codons and those containing overlaps were eliminated. Frame shifts and point mutations were corrected or designated ‘authentic.’ Functional assignment, identification of membrane-spanning domains, and determination of paralogous gene families were performed as previously described [24]. Sequence alignments and phylogenetic trees were generated using the methods described previously [24].  Trinucleotide composition  Distribution of all 64 trinucleotides (3-mers) was determined, and the 3-mer distribution in 1,000-bp windows that overlapped by half their length (500 bp) across the genome was computed. For each window, we computed the χ2 statistic on the difference between its 3-mer content and that of the whole chromosome. A large value for indicates the 3-mer composition in this window is different from the rest of the chromosome (minimum of two standard deviations). Probability values for this analysis are based on assumptions that the DNA composition is relatively uniform throughout the genome, and that 3-mer composition is independent. Because these assumptions may be incorrect, we prefer to interpret high χ2 values as indicators of regions on the chromosome that appear unusual and demand further scrutiny.  Comparative genomics  The B. ovis ATCC25840 genome was compared to the genomes of B. suis 1330, B. abortus 2308, B. abortus 9-941, and B. melitensis 16M (PATRIC), at the nucleotide level by suffix tree analysis using MUMmer [81], and the predicted B. ovis CDSs were compared with the gene sets from the other sequenced Brucella genomes by BLAST and by HMM paralogous family searches, as previously described [82].  Analysis of the B. ovis-specific island  Genomic DNA from B. ovis strains and other Brucella species (B. melitensis, B. suis, B. abortus, B. canis, B. neotomae, and B. pinnipedialis) were subjected to PCR amplification of 12 target sequences within the B. ovis-specific island. PCR reactions were performed using 13 µL of a commercial PCR mix (PCR Supermix, Invitrogen, USA), 0.75 µL of a 25 µM solution of each primer (Supplementary Table S1), and 1 µL of DNA (100 to 500 ng per reaction). Cycling parameters were denaturation at 95°C for 5 minutes; 35 cycles of denaturation (95°C for 1 min seconds), annealing (55°C for 1 min), and extension (72°C for 1 min); and a final extension at 72°C for 5 min.

The genome of this strain consists of two circular chromosomes of 2,111,370 bp (Chromosome I; NCBI Accession Number NC_009505) and 1,164,220 bp (Chromosome II; NCBI Accession Number NC_009504), which are predicted to encode a total of 2890 proteins, 1928 on ChrI and 962 on ChrII (Table 1). Features of the B. ovis genome are summarized in Table 1. Comparison with the sequenced genomes of B. suis (GenBank Accession numbers NC_004310 and NC_004311) [24], B. abortus (GenBank Accession numbers NC_007618 and NC_007624) [21], [22] and B. melitensis 16M (GenBank Accession numbers NC_003317 and NC_003318) [19] shows a large degree of conservation, particularly in the % G+C content and size of the chromosomes. This comparison also revealed several species-specific differences, including regions missing from B. ovis relative to the other sequenced Brucella genomes and genes unique to B. ovis. These differences are listed in Table 1 and Figures 1–2, and are discussed below.  10.1371/journal.pone.0005519.g001  Figure 1  Whole genome alignment of sequenced Brucella strains.  The five genomes were compared to each other by using COG, BLAST and HMM analyses. Each genome is colored with a gradient that ranges from yellow (nucleotide 1) to blue (end). Differences in color between a reference sequence (the bottom colored line in each set) and the other genomes indicate conserved protein-coding regions that have been rearranged. Uncolored segments denote coding regions in which no conserved genes were detected.

Comparative best-match blastp searches identified 2282 annotated proteins in B. ovis that are shared with B. suis, B. melitensis and B. abortus, 79% of the annotated proteome. Nonetheless, this analysis suggested that the B. ovis genome lacks 675, 610 and 539 protein coding genes annotated in B. suis, B. melitensis and B. abortus 2308, respectively (Table S3). To determine whether these genes are truly absent from the B. ovis genome they were compared to the B. ovis chromosomal sequences using blastn searches. Interestingly, good matches were found for 64, 125 and 18 genes thought to be lacking in B. ovis in the genomes of B. suis, B. melitensis and B. abortus 2308, respectively (Table S3). There are several possible reasons for these genes not being highlighted as shared using comparative best-match blastp searches, e.g., they may be pseudogenes in B. ovis and therefore, not part of the predicted proteome, they may be the products of duplications where only one duplication product is matched in best match searches or differences in gene annotation between the strains resulted in these sequences not being annotated as a protein coding gene in B. ovis. In total only 33 annotated protein coding genes in B. ovis are unique to this species.  Genomic rearrangements  Gradient figures were used to compare the chromosomes of B. ovis with those of the other sequenced Brucella genomes. No large inversions or rearrangements were observed in the B. ovis genome compared to the sequenced genomes of B. suis or B. melitensis (Figure 1).  Genomic deletions  Chromosome I  Four deletions of 4 kb or larger were identified in the B. ovis genome, compared to its closest relative, B. suis. Chromosome I lacks a 15 kb region that encompasses B. suis BR0966-BR0987. Interestingly, in B. suis, this region is inserted into the sequence of tRNAgly and is adjacent to a phage integrase-like gene, features suggestive of horizontal gene transfer. This region contains the wboA glycosyl transferase gene, shown to be essential for lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis [25], and a second glycosyl transferase, as well as several hypothetical proteins. The lack of the two glycosyl transferases likely contributes to the rough LPS phenotype of B. ovis. These findings were in agreement with previous reports by Vizcaino et al and Rajashekara et al [23], [26] showing the absence of these genes from B. ovis.  A second deletion on Chromosome I of 7745 bp encompasses BR1078-BR1083. This island in B. suis contains three hypothetical genes and two site specific recombinases and is flanked by two tRNA-Leu genes, of which one remains in B. ovis. A smaller deletion of 3954 bp on Chromosome I has led to loss of two genes (BR1852-BR1853) encoding a transcriptional regulator and a protein predicted to be a branched chain amino acid permease. This deletion is also associated with transposable elements, as these two genes in B. suis are flanked by copies of IS2020  [27], one of which remains in B. ovis.  Chromosome II  The 44.5 kb island in B. suis (BRA1074-BRA1113; [28]), containing four predicted ABC transport systems and three transcriptional regulators, is absent from the B. ovis genome. The presence of two copies of IS1239 flanking two pseudogenes in B. ovis suggests that this is the result of a loss of this region by recombination.  The 18.3 kb IncP island on B. suis Chromosome II containing BRA0362-BRA0379, previously reported to be present in B. suis biovars 1–4, B. canis, B. neotomae, and marine mammal isolates but missing in B. melitensis  [24], [28], is also absent from the B. ovis genome, as reported by Lavigne and colleagues [28].  Unique genomic regions  Chromosome II, contains an island of 26.5 kb (BOV_A0482-BOV_A0515) with structure suggestive of a composite transposon (Fig. 2). This island likely overlaps the B. ovis-specific 21-kb SpeI fragment of the small chromosome identified previously by genome mapping [29]. Proteins encoded on the island include transposases, an ABC transporter, a putative hemagglutinin, and several hypothetical proteins. This region is present in 17/17 B. ovis strains tested, suggesting a high level of conservation within the species (Supplementary Table S2). Interestingly, the predicted product of BOV_A0497 exhibits similarity to antitoxins of toxin-antitoxin maintenance systems [30], suggesting a possible selective pressure for maintenance of this genetic island in B. ovis. Genome sequence data and analysis of the island by PCR showed that this region is absent from the genomes of B. suis, B. abortus, B. melitensis, B. canis and B. neotomae (Table 2), suggesting initially that it may be specific to B. ovis. However, we detected this island in three marine isolates of Brucella from captive bottlenose dolphins [31], [32]. The protein coding genes within this unique region constitute the majority of the unique protein coding genes in B. ovis (Supplementary Table S3).  10.1371/journal.pone.0005519.t002  Table 2  Detection of the B. ovis genomic island in Brucella species  Species  ORF  Brucella ovis  B. melitensis  B. abortus  B. suis  B. canis  B. neotomae  B. ceti (Muu)  B. ceti (Cudo)  B. ceti (Nor)  NTC1  A0492  +  −  −  −  −  −  +  +  +  −  A0495  +  −  −  −  −  −  +  +  +  −  A0496  +  −  −  −  −  −  +  +  +  −  A0497  +  −  −  −  −  −  +  +  +  −  A0500  +  −  −  −  −  −  +  +  +  −  A0502  +  −  −  −  −  −  +  +  +  −  A0503  +  −  −  −  −  −  +  +  +  −  A0504  +  −  −  −  −  −  +  +  +  −  A0505  +  −  −  −  −  −  +  +  +  −  A0506  +  −  −  −  −  −  +  +  +  −  A0511  +  −  −  −  −  −  +  +  +  −  A0512  +  −  −  −  −  −  +  +  +  −  BR06152  +  +  +  +  +  +  +  +  +  −  1  NTC, no template control  2  Positive control for amplification reaction  Transposable elements  The genome of B. ovis contains 38 complete copies of IS711, confirming previous estimates obtained by hybridization [33]. 25 of the copies are located in Chromosome I, and 13 in Chromosome II. Interestingly, several of these copies appear to be expanded clonally, suggesting that they could be active in B. ovis. In 17 cases, IS711 is inserted in copies of a repeated sequence of the BruRS family [34]. Five of the IS711 copies appear to disrupt genes, which could be a contributing factor to the general process of genome degradation observed in B. ovis. A case of special interest is the B. ovis-specific island (see above), where a 25 kb region between two copies of IS711 in B. ovis is absent in all the other sequenced species, suggestive of either deletion by recombination between the two copies in the other Brucella species, or of acquisition of the region with duplication of IS711.  Pseudogenes  It has been proposed that the unique complement of pseudogenes in each of the Brucella species may contribute to their differing degrees of infectivity and host preference [21], [22]. Interestingly B. abortus, which is less virulent for humans than B. suis and B. melitensis, has a greater number of pseudogenes (316) than B. suis 1330 (62) or B. melitensis 16M (163) (Table 1). Similar to B. abortus, the B. ovis genome contains a large number of pseudogenes with 244 identified. The small chromosome contains more pseudogenes (125; 11.3%) than the large chromosome (119; 5.7%) (Table 1). Of the 244 B. ovis pseudogenes, 40 are hypothetical or conserved hypothetical genes, 62 have predicted transport functions, 23 are defective transposases, and 14 are predicted to have regulatory functions. The finding that some pseudogenes in the B. melitensis flagellar region encode full-length proteins raises the question of whether some pseudogenes in B. ovis may also be functional [35].  Metabolism  Urease  Based on biotyping, B. ovis is urease-negative. However it contains the two urease clusters described in all the other sequenced Brucella genomes. Urease has been reported to be important for the ability of B. abortus  [36] and B. suis  [37] to survive passage through the stomach in the mouse model of infection. The importance of urease for oral infection is consistent with a lack of human infections observed with B. ovis, despite identification of this organism in the milk of infected ewes [38]. The ure1 cluster is the only one showing urease activity at least in B. abortus, B. melitensis, and B. suis  [36], [37], while the ure2 does not have any demonstrable urease activity. The ure1 cluster of B. ovis contains several point mutations that are predicted to result in conserved changes shared by at least one other urease positive species. However, UreC1 contains a 30 bp deletion that would cause a loss of 10 amino acids in UreC1. Although all the residues described to be important for enzymatic activity of UreC1 are conserved [39], this deletion must render the urease inactive. Moreover, complementation with the ureC1 gene from B. melitensis (Sangari, unpublished results) results in urease activity. Regarding the ure2 cluster, ureF2 (BOV_1316) and ureT (BOV_1319) are pseudogenes, while the remaining genes are conserved, suggesting that this cluster could encode an unknown activity.  Sugar metabolism  B. ovis is defective in oxidative metabolism of arabinose, galactose, ribose, xylose, glucose and erythritol [40]. Analysis of the genome sequence reveals a possible basis for these metabolic defects in B. ovis relative to the human pathogenic Brucella species. Several putative sugar transporters predicted to be functional in other Brucella species appear to be inactivated by frameshifts, point mutations or gene degradation in B. ovis. Further, pckA encoding phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (BOV_2009) is inactivated by frameshift, which would affect the gluconeogenesis pathway and the ability of B. ovis to utilize pyruvate, amino acids, or glycerol as carbon sources.  Erythritol  Erythritol is the preferred carbon source of B. abortus  [41], [42]. Erythritol is metabolized in Brucella by the enzymes encoded in the eryABCD operon[43] Moreover, it has been recently described that the carbohydrate transport system located upstream of the ery operon constitutes the erythritol transport system in Rhizobium leguminosarum bv. Viciae  [44], and that the operon immediately downstream also forms part of the erythritol catabolic pathway. Microarray experiments have revealed that these three operons are regulated by erythritol in B. abortus, reinforcing that the three clusters participate in erythritol catabolism (Sangari et al, unpublished). B. ovis does not oxidize erythritol, and it is not inhibited by its presence in the growth media. This is reflected in the genome by the presence of a stop codon in eryA (BOV_A0811) and a frameshift in eryD (BOV_A0814) that render them pseudogenes. In addition two genes of the putative ABC erythritol transport system, eryF and eryG (BOV_A805 and BOV_A806)) carry mutations that render them pseudogenes (a 2 bp deletion resulting in an premature stop codon). The mutation in eryD could have an effect in the over expression of all genes of the ery system. On the contrary, mutations in the transport genes and in eryA block the entry of erythritol in the cell and its phosphorylation, avoiding the accumulation of toxic intermediates and the depletion of ATP observed in the vaccine strain S19 [45]. The accumulation of mutations in these two clusters suggest that they may no longer be needed by B. ovis. The third cluster is intact, and the enzymes use substrates that are central (or core) carbohydrate metabolites such as dihydroxyacetone phosphate, glyceraldehydes-3-phosphate, and other three carbon compounds that can be produced after decarboxylation of erythritol and its derivatives.  While it has been hypothesized that erythritol may serve as a carbon source during growth of B. abortus, B. suis, and B. melitensis in the placenta of their natural hosts, an analysis of deletion mutants in these models has not been reported. However, the lower incidence of abortion in sheep flocks infected with B. ovis compared to B. melitensis correlates with the inability of B. ovis to use erythritol as a carbon source. Mutants in eryB and eryC have been described to have a limited ability to grow in macrophages [46]. This limitation may well contribute to the limited virulence of B. ovis.  Glucose and Galactose  Unlike B. melitensis, B. abortus and B. suis, B. ovis is unable to grow on glucose or galactose as a primary carbon source [40]. Analysis of genes involved in uptake and utilization of these carbon sources reveals that B. ovis gluP (BOV_A0172), encoding a glucose/galactose transporter [47] is a pseudogene. B. abortus gluP mutants have a reduced ability to persist in the spleens of mice [48], suggesting that the ability to utilize these carbon sources may be important for systemic persistence of the human pathogenic Brucella species. However B. suis also lacks GluP and is able to oxidize glucose and galactose, suggesting that additional functions are lacking in B. ovis that contribute to utilization of these carbon sources. Several predicted sugar ABC transporters (BOV_1299-BOV1301, BOV_A0278-BOV_A0282, BOV_A0645-BOV_A0648 and BOV_A1083-BOV_A1086) of unknown specificity contain pseudogenes, which may potentially reduce the ability of B. ovis to take up glucose and galactose.  Ribose  Two components, a permease and an ATP binding protein of a putative ribose ABC transport system (BOV_A0936-BOV_A0937) are pseudogenes in B. ovis, suggesting that the inability of B. ovis to utilize ribose as a sole carbon source may be the result of a reduced capacity to take up ribose from the growth medium. Similarly, a periplasmic binding protein and an ATP binding protein of a predicted ABC transporter for xylose (BOV_A1055-BOVA1056) contain frameshifts, which may underlie the inability of B. ovis to utilize xylose [40].  Oxidase phenotype  B. ovis is the only Brucella species with a negative oxidase phenotype. Oxidase phenotype depends on the activity of cytochrome C oxidase which in B. suis is encoded by at least 7 genes, four of them organized in one operon, BR0363-BR0360 (ccoNOQP), together with BR0467 (coxB), encoding cytochrome c oxidase, subunit II, BR0468 (coxA) encoding cytochrome c oxidase, subunit I and BR0472 (coxC) encoding cytochrome c oxidase, subunit III. In B. ovis, the operon ccoNOQP (BOV_0376-BOV_0379), encoding the cb type cytochrome c oxidase is well conserved, except the gene ccoO (BOV_0378), which contains a frameshift generated by deletion of an A near its 5′ end, is a pseudogene. The B. ovis coxB gene (BOV_0473) contains a frameshift that very probably inactivates the gene, while coxA (BOV_0474) differs only in two residues with the B. suis product. The last 6 amino acids of coxC (BOV_0478) are lost as result of a short deletion (56 bp) that fuses this product with the next, apparently unrelated Orf. A short repeated sequence (GGGGCGGC) at both ends of the deletion seems to be responsible for this rearrangement. These genomic differences may be responsible for the oxidase negative phenotype of B. ovis.  Nitrogen metabolism  Several genes encoded in the B. suis genome with inferred functions in nitrogen metabolism are not predicted to be functional in the B. ovis genome. The genes norB (BOV_A0225), encoding the large subunit of nitric oxide reductase, and nosX (BOV_A0256), a gene of unknown function in the operon encoding nitric oxide synthase, are pseudogenes in B. ovis. The third gene, narK (BOV_A0276), encoding a nitrite extrusion protein, is degenerate, as was found in the B. melitensis and B. abortus 2308 genomes [21]. Nitric oxide reductase is required for survival and persistence of B. suis in mice [49], suggesting that lack of this activity in B. ovis may contribute to its restricted tissue tropism and host range.  A locus that contributes to growth of E. coli on aspartate as a nitrogen source, xanthine dehydrogenase (BOV_0365-BOV_0367;  [50]) contains a pseudogene in B. ovis, suggesting a further defect in nitrogen metabolism. Further, this locus could function in salvage pathways for purine nucleotides, which could contribute to nitrogen metabolism. A correlation between a defective purine nucleotide salvage pathway and reduced ability of B. ovis to survive intracellularly would be consistent with the importance of purine biosynthetic pathways for full virulence of B. abortus and B. melitensis  [51], [52]. Further, a homolog of Sinorhizobium meliloti fixI (BOV_0373), encoding an cation pump involved in symbiotic nitrogen fixation [53], is inactivated by a point mutation in the B. ovis genome. As the function of the fixGHI genes in Brucella spp. has not been determined, the biological significance of this gene inactivation for B. ovis is currently unknown.  Host-pathogen interactions  Lipopolysaccharide  B. ovis is known to have a rough LPS phenotype, which given the critical role of O-antigen in pathogenicity of B. abortus, B. suis and B. melitensis, likely contributes to its reduced pathogenicity for laboratory animals compared to other Brucella spp. [8], [54], [55]. As mentioned above, the wboA gene is missing from B. ovis, as well as a second, genetically linked glycosyltransferase. Pseudogenes with a possible function in LPS biosynthesis include a glycosyltransferase (BOV_A0475), an LpxA family acetyltransferase (BOV_A0367) and a putative undecaprenylphosphate alpha-N-acetylglucosamine transferase (BOV_A0371) of which the latter may also be involved in murein biosynthesis. While it is known that B. ovis LPS has a higher affinity for antimicrobial peptides than that of B. abortus, it is unknown whether differences in LPS structure compared to smooth Brucella species affect the interaction of B. ovis LPS with toll-like receptors of the innate immune system [56], [57].  Type IV secretion system (T4SS)  The T4SS, encoded by virB1-virB12, is an essential virulence factor in B. abortus, B. suis, and B. melitensis  [48], [58]–[60]. The genes virB1-VirB12 are intact in the B. ovis genome, suggesting that this system is functional. Further, the gene encoding its transcriptional activator VjbR (BOVA_0110;  [61]) is conserved. These findings are consistent with the detection of VirB5 and VirB8 expression in B. ovis  [62]. Two co-regulated genes identified as encoding T4SS substrates, vceA (BOV_1577) and vceC (BOV_1003) are present in B. ovis, however it is currently unknown whether there may be additional T4SS effectors in other Brucella spp. that are absent from B. ovis  [63]. A recent report showing that B. ovis strain PA is able to replicate in macrophages and HeLa cells at a rate similar to that of B. abortus suggests that its T4SS is functional [64].  Autotransporter proteins  Four predicted autotransporters have been identified in the sequenced Brucella genomes. Each of the sequenced Brucella genomes is predicted to encode a different combination of autotransporters [21], suggesting that none of these four proteins is essential for virulence, but that different combinations of autotransporters may contribute to observed differences in tissue tropism and host preference. The B. ovis genome is predicted to encode three functional autotransporters, corresponding to B. suis BR0072, BRA0173 and BRA1148, (BOV_0071, BOV_A0152 and BOV_A1053) while the fourth gene, BOV_1937, corresponding to BR2013, is degenerate. These proteins show a range in similarity (at the amino acid level) to their B. suis counterparts, from 99% between BRA1148 and BOV_A1053, to 86% similarity between BOV_A0152 and BRA0173. BR2013, designated omaA, is a pseudogene in both B. abortus and B. melitensis, and was noted to have a polymorphism with unknown functional effects in the genome of vaccine strain B. abortus 19 [65]. Since the product of this gene has been shown to contribute to persistence of B. suis in mice [66], it is possible that lack of a functional OmaA autotransporter in B. ovis may contribute to its limited tissue tropism and host range. However, the finding that all four autotransporter genes are predicted to be pseudogenes in B. melitensis, shows that they are not absolutely required for infectivity and transmission.  Immunomodulatory functions  In addition to the T4SS, several genes implicated in modulation of the immune response by Brucella spp., are well-conserved in B. ovis ATCC25840. These include btp1, encoding the TIR domain protein, an inhibitor of TLR2 signaling, the B cell mitogen encoded by prpA, and cyclic β-glucan synthase [67]–[70].  Outer membrane proteins  The two component regulator BvrR/BvrS, which has been shown to be a master regulator of many virulence-associated functions [71], [72], appears intact in B. ovis. However, a putative envZ osmosensor (BOV_A0412) is a pseudogene. Two genes shown to encode outer membrane proteins in other Brucella species omp2a (BOV_0632  [73]) and omp31 (BOV_1565; [74]), contain point mutations in B. ovis. For Omp31, the point mutation is predicted to lead to a truncation in the protein. It was found previously that the outer membrane of B. ovis is more susceptible to cationic peptides than a rough B. abortus mutant [56], suggesting that together with the defects in LPS biosynthesis discussed above, these defects in outer membrane components may further compromise the cell envelope stability of B. ovis making it less able to survive environmental stresses.  Perspective  The unique biology of Brucella ovis compared to the human pathogenic species appears to be in part the result of genome degradation. Worldwide, the majority of human brucellosis cases occur via ingestion of contaminated dairy products. B. ovis is not known to cause human infection, despite worldwide consumption of unpasteurized sheep's milk, where B. ovis has been detected [38]. Oral transmission, although feasible in experimental conditions, does not appear to be one of the main routes of infection for B. ovis, whereas passive venereal transmission via the ewe is the most important one [75]. This suggests that this species has lost the ability to infect via the oral route. One genomic change that may contribute to this loss of oral infectivity is the loss of an important virulence factor, urease, that is required for survival of stomach acidity by Brucella spp [36], [37]. Urease has also been shown to contribute to the establishment of Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae infection in pigs through the respiratory tract [76]. If this mechanism is also operative in Brucella spp., then it is possible that B. ovis is also deficient in establishing infections not only by the digestive route but also via aerosol inhalation, which are the two main routes of infection by human pathogenic Brucella spp. Additional genes that seem to be non-functional in B. ovis could also contribute to reduce the number of transmission routes compared to other Brucella species. A characteristic of B. ovis is its tropism for the ovine male genital tract, which presents as epididymo-orchitis [8]. Since other Brucella species, especially B. melitensis are known to cause epididymo-orchitis in human patients [77], the predilection of B. ovis to cause epididymo-orchitis in rams likely represents a loss of functions required to target to other tissues. However, due to the large number of genes in the B. ovis genome with unknown function, a gain of functions that allow for increased colonization of the male genital tract cannot be ruled out based on the genome sequence.

PMC2677664,Abstract,Abstract,NC_004310,1,0,0,,,"  Brucella ovis is a veterinary pathogen associated with epididymitis in sheep. Despite its genetic similarity to the zoonotic pathogens B. abortus, B. melitensis and B. suis, B. ovis does not cause zoonotic disease. Genomic analysis of the type strain ATCC25840 revealed a high percentage of pseudogenes and increased numbers of transposable elements compared to the zoonotic Brucella species, suggesting that genome degradation has occurred concomitant with narrowing of the host range of B. ovis. The absence of genomic island 2, encoding functions required for lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis, as well as inactivation of genes encoding urease, nutrient uptake and utilization, and outer membrane proteins may be factors contributing to the avirulence of B. ovis for humans. A 26.5 kb region of B. ovis ATCC25840 Chromosome II was absent from all the sequenced human pathogenic Brucella genomes, but was present in all of 17 B. ovis isolates tested and in three B. ceti isolates, suggesting that this DNA region may be of use for differentiating B. ovis from other Brucella spp. This is the first genomic analysis of a non-zoonotic Brucella species. The results suggest that inactivation of genes involved in nutrient acquisition and utilization, cell envelope structure and urease may have played a role in narrowing of the tissue tropism and host range of B. ovis.

PMC2677664,Introduction,Introduction,NC_004310,0,1,0,,,"  Introduction  Although previous studies have supported the notion of Brucella as a monospecies genus with different biotypes [1], it is still largely accepted that the genus Brucella is divided into six species, named according to their preferential hosts. Each one of the species is host-adapted, but not host-restricted [2]–[4]. Four of the six Brucella species, namely B. melitensis, B. abortus, B. suis, and B. canis, are capable of causing human disease. B. melitensis and B. suis are the most pathogenic, whereas B. abortus is considered of moderate pathogenicity, and B. canis is considered of low pathogenicity for humans. There are no reports of human infections with B. ovis or B. neotomae  [3]. In addition to the six classical Brucella species, Brucella has also been isolated from marine mammals, and two species, B. pinnipedialis and B. ceti have been proposed [5]. Brucella isolates from marine mammals can cause human infections, with one reported case of infection due to laboratory exposure [6], and two reported cases of natural infections resulting in neurological disease [7].  Brucella ovis was initially recognized in the beginning of the 1950's in New Zealand and Australia as a bacterial agent associated with epididymitis and abortion in sheep [8]. Since then this organism has been isolated in several countries [9], and is considered one of the most important causes of ovine infertility, with a significant economic impact on the sheep industry [10]. B. ovis has a worldwide distribution in areas where sheep are economically significant, with the exception of the Great Britain [9]. The prevalence in herds ranges from 9.1 to 46.7% [11], and the seroprevalence within positive herds varies between 2.1 to 67% [11]–[14].  B. ovis is stably rough, and it is one of the two classical Brucella species that do not have zoonotic potential. In sheep, the organism causes either clinical or sub-clinical chronic infections characterized by epididymitis, orchitis, male infertility, and occasionally abortion in pregnant ewes [15]. Sexually mature rams are more susceptible than young males [16]. However, B. ovis infection may affect males as young as 4 months old [9]. Natural transmission apparently occurs through mucosal membranes, and venereal transmission is significant when a female previously mated with an infected male copulates with a second susceptible male during the same period of estrus [17]. Upon invasion through mucosal membranes, B. ovis initially resides in local lymph nodes, which is followed by bacteremia and finally colonization of the genital tract around 30 days post infection [18]. The factors defining the genital tropism of this organism remain unknown.  Sequencing of B. melitensis, and B. suis genomes demonstrated a high level of similarity between the two genomes, with over 90% of the genes having more than 98–100% nucleotide identity [19]. Furthermore, comparison between these two species resulted in the identification of only 32 and 43 genes that were unique to B. melitensis and B. suis, respectively. This level of variability is remarkably low even when compared to variations between serotypes within the same bacterial species such as in serotypes Typhi and Typhimurium of Samonella enterica  [20]. More recently, the complete genome sequence of B. abortus (strains 9–941 and 2308) became available confirming the striking similarity both among different species of Brucella and within the species B. abortus  [21], [22]. Comparisons between these three Brucella species revealed more than 94% identity at the nucleotide level. In addition, comparisons between the genomes of the two B. abortus strains that have been sequenced (9–941 and 2308) resulted in identification of only a small number of strain-specific deletions and polymorphisms [21]. The genetic similarity among Brucella species has been confirmed by whole genome hybridizations [23]. Together these studies support the original hybridization studies performed more than 20 years ago suggesting that Brucella is a monospecific genus from the genetic point of view [1]. Considering the high level of identity among Brucella species pathogenic to humans, the comparison of those species with a Brucella lacking the potential to cause human infections may bring new insights into host specificity and pathogenesis. In this study we present the genome analysis of the rough non-human-pathogen Brucella ovis and compare its genome with those of the zoonotic Brucella spp. Our analysis focused on two sets of genomic features (i) deletions and gene degradation that could potentially result in loss of virulence factors important for infection of hosts other than sheep, and (ii) B. ovis-specific genes that could contribute to genital tract tropism or cause a reduction in virulence for non-ovine hosts.

PMC2677664,Materials and Methods,Materials and Methods,NC_004310,1,0,0,,,"  Materials and Methods  Genome sequencing and annotation  The complete genome sequence of Brucella ovis strain ATCC25840 was determined using the whole-genome shotgun method as previously described [78]. Physical and sequencing gaps were closed using a combination of primer walking, generation and sequencing of transposon-tagged libraries of large-insert clones, and multiplex PCR [79]. Identification of putative protein-encoding genes and annotation of the genome were performed as previously described [24]. An initial set of genes predicted to encode proteins was identified with GLIMMER [80]. Genes consisting of fewer than 30 codons and those containing overlaps were eliminated. Frame shifts and point mutations were corrected or designated ‘authentic.’ Functional assignment, identification of membrane-spanning domains, and determination of paralogous gene families were performed as previously described [24]. Sequence alignments and phylogenetic trees were generated using the methods described previously [24].  Trinucleotide composition  Distribution of all 64 trinucleotides (3-mers) was determined, and the 3-mer distribution in 1,000-bp windows that overlapped by half their length (500 bp) across the genome was computed. For each window, we computed the χ2 statistic on the difference between its 3-mer content and that of the whole chromosome. A large value for indicates the 3-mer composition in this window is different from the rest of the chromosome (minimum of two standard deviations). Probability values for this analysis are based on assumptions that the DNA composition is relatively uniform throughout the genome, and that 3-mer composition is independent. Because these assumptions may be incorrect, we prefer to interpret high χ2 values as indicators of regions on the chromosome that appear unusual and demand further scrutiny.  Comparative genomics  The B. ovis ATCC25840 genome was compared to the genomes of B. suis 1330, B. abortus 2308, B. abortus 9-941, and B. melitensis 16M (PATRIC), at the nucleotide level by suffix tree analysis using MUMmer [81], and the predicted B. ovis CDSs were compared with the gene sets from the other sequenced Brucella genomes by BLAST and by HMM paralogous family searches, as previously described [82].  Analysis of the B. ovis-specific island  Genomic DNA from B. ovis strains and other Brucella species (B. melitensis, B. suis, B. abortus, B. canis, B. neotomae, and B. pinnipedialis) were subjected to PCR amplification of 12 target sequences within the B. ovis-specific island. PCR reactions were performed using 13 µL of a commercial PCR mix (PCR Supermix, Invitrogen, USA), 0.75 µL of a 25 µM solution of each primer (Supplementary Table S1), and 1 µL of DNA (100 to 500 ng per reaction). Cycling parameters were denaturation at 95°C for 5 minutes; 35 cycles of denaturation (95°C for 1 min seconds), annealing (55°C for 1 min), and extension (72°C for 1 min); and a final extension at 72°C for 5 min. PCR products were resolved by agarose gel electrophoresis.

PMC2677664,Results and Discussion,Results and Discussion,NC_004310,1,1,0,,,"  Results and Discussion  General features of the B. ovis genome  The B. ovis type strain ATCC25840 (also known as 63/290 or NCTC10512) used for sequencing was isolated from a sheep in Australia in 1960 [8]. The genome of this strain consists of two circular chromosomes of 2,111,370 bp (Chromosome I; NCBI Accession Number NC_009505) and 1,164,220 bp (Chromosome II; NCBI Accession Number NC_009504), which are predicted to encode a total of 2890 proteins, 1928 on ChrI and 962 on ChrII (Table 1). Features of the B. ovis genome are summarized in Table 1. Comparison with the sequenced genomes of B. suis (GenBank Accession numbers NC_004310 and NC_004311) [24], B. abortus (GenBank Accession numbers NC_007618 and NC_007624) [21], [22] and B. melitensis 16M (GenBank Accession numbers NC_003317 and NC_003318) [19] shows a large degree of conservation, particularly in the % G+C content and size of the chromosomes. This comparison also revealed several species-specific differences, including regions missing from B. ovis relative to the other sequenced Brucella genomes and genes unique to B. ovis. These differences are listed in Table 1 and Figures 1–2, and are discussed below.  10.1371/journal.pone.0005519.g001  Figure 1  Whole genome alignment of sequenced Brucella strains.  The five genomes were compared to each other by using COG, BLAST and HMM analyses. Each genome is colored with a gradient that ranges from yellow (nucleotide 1) to blue (end). Differences in color between a reference sequence (the bottom colored line in each set) and the other genomes indicate conserved protein-coding regions that have been rearranged. Uncolored segments denote coding regions in which no conserved genes were detected. The curves on top of each panel represent the nucleotide composition (Χ2 analysis) (see   Materials and Methods  ) of the reference strain of the panel, and peaks indicate regions of atypical composition.  10.1371/journal.pone.0005519.g002  Figure 2  Map of the B. ovis-specific island on Chromosome II, which resembles a composite transposon.

Comparative best-match blastp searches identified 2282 annotated proteins in B. ovis that are shared with B. suis, B. melitensis and B. abortus, 79% of the annotated proteome. Nonetheless, this analysis suggested that the B. ovis genome lacks 675, 610 and 539 protein coding genes annotated in B. suis, B. melitensis and B. abortus 2308, respectively (Table S3). To determine whether these genes are truly absent from the B. ovis genome they were compared to the B. ovis chromosomal sequences using blastn searches. Interestingly, good matches were found for 64, 125 and 18 genes thought to be lacking in B. ovis in the genomes of B. suis, B. melitensis and B. abortus 2308, respectively (Table S3). There are several possible reasons for these genes not being highlighted as shared using comparative best-match blastp searches, e.g., they may be pseudogenes in B. ovis and therefore, not part of the predicted proteome, they may be the products of duplications where only one duplication product is matched in best match searches or differences in gene annotation between the strains resulted in these sequences not being annotated as a protein coding gene in B. ovis. In total only 33 annotated protein coding genes in B. ovis are unique to this species.  Genomic rearrangements  Gradient figures were used to compare the chromosomes of B. ovis with those of the other sequenced Brucella genomes. No large inversions or rearrangements were observed in the B. ovis genome compared to the sequenced genomes of B. suis or B. melitensis (Figure 1).  Genomic deletions  Chromosome I  Four deletions of 4 kb or larger were identified in the B. ovis genome, compared to its closest relative, B. suis. Chromosome I lacks a 15 kb region that encompasses B. suis BR0966-BR0987. Interestingly, in B. suis, this region is inserted into the sequence of tRNAgly and is adjacent to a phage integrase-like gene, features suggestive of horizontal gene transfer. This region contains the wboA glycosyl transferase gene, shown to be essential for lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis [25], and a second glycosyl transferase, as well as several hypothetical proteins. The lack of the two glycosyl transferases likely contributes to the rough LPS phenotype of B. ovis. These findings were in agreement with previous reports by Vizcaino et al and Rajashekara et al [23], [26] showing the absence of these genes from B. ovis.  A second deletion on Chromosome I of 7745 bp encompasses BR1078-BR1083. This island in B. suis contains three hypothetical genes and two site specific recombinases and is flanked by two tRNA-Leu genes, of which one remains in B. ovis. A smaller deletion of 3954 bp on Chromosome I has led to loss of two genes (BR1852-BR1853) encoding a transcriptional regulator and a protein predicted to be a branched chain amino acid permease. This deletion is also associated with transposable elements, as these two genes in B. suis are flanked by copies of IS2020  [27], one of which remains in B. ovis.  Chromosome II  The 44.5 kb island in B. suis (BRA1074-BRA1113; [28]), containing four predicted ABC transport systems and three transcriptional regulators, is absent from the B. ovis genome. The presence of two copies of IS1239 flanking two pseudogenes in B. ovis suggests that this is the result of a loss of this region by recombination.  The 18.3 kb IncP island on B. suis Chromosome II containing BRA0362-BRA0379, previously reported to be present in B. suis biovars 1–4, B. canis, B. neotomae, and marine mammal isolates but missing in B. melitensis  [24], [28], is also absent from the B. ovis genome, as reported by Lavigne and colleagues [28].  Unique genomic regions  Chromosome II, contains an island of 26.5 kb (BOV_A0482-BOV_A0515) with structure suggestive of a composite transposon (Fig. 2). This island likely overlaps the B. ovis-specific 21-kb SpeI fragment of the small chromosome identified previously by genome mapping [29]. Proteins encoded on the island include transposases, an ABC transporter, a putative hemagglutinin, and several hypothetical proteins. This region is present in 17/17 B. ovis strains tested, suggesting a high level of conservation within the species (Supplementary Table S2). Interestingly, the predicted product of BOV_A0497 exhibits similarity to antitoxins of toxin-antitoxin maintenance systems [30], suggesting a possible selective pressure for maintenance of this genetic island in B. ovis. Genome sequence data and analysis of the island by PCR showed that this region is absent from the genomes of B. suis, B. abortus, B. melitensis, B. canis and B. neotomae (Table 2), suggesting initially that it may be specific to B. ovis. However, we detected this island in three marine isolates of Brucella from captive bottlenose dolphins [31], [32]. The protein coding genes within this unique region constitute the majority of the unique protein coding genes in B. ovis (Supplementary Table S3).  10.1371/journal.pone.0005519.t002  Table 2  Detection of the B. ovis genomic island in Brucella species  Species  ORF  Brucella ovis  B. melitensis  B. abortus  B. suis  B. canis  B. neotomae  B. ceti (Muu)  B. ceti (Cudo)  B. ceti (Nor)  NTC1  A0492  +  −  −  −  −  −  +  +  +  −  A0495  +  −  −  −  −  −  +  +  +  −  A0496  +  −  −  −  −  −  +  +  +  −  A0497  +  −  −  −  −  −  +  +  +  −  A0500  +  −  −  −  −  −  +  +  +  −  A0502  +  −  −  −  −  −  +  +  +  −  A0503  +  −  −  −  −  −  +  +  +  −  A0504  +  −  −  −  −  −  +  +  +  −  A0505  +  −  −  −  −  −  +  +  +  −  A0506  +  −  −  −  −  −  +  +  +  −  A0511  +  −  −  −  −  −  +  +  +  −  A0512  +  −  −  −  −  −  +  +  +  −  BR06152  +  +  +  +  +  +  +  +  +  −  1  NTC, no template control  2  Positive control for amplification reaction  Transposable elements  The genome of B. ovis contains 38 complete copies of IS711, confirming previous estimates obtained by hybridization [33]. 25 of the copies are located in Chromosome I, and 13 in Chromosome II. Interestingly, several of these copies appear to be expanded clonally, suggesting that they could be active in B. ovis. In 17 cases, IS711 is inserted in copies of a repeated sequence of the BruRS family [34]. Five of the IS711 copies appear to disrupt genes, which could be a contributing factor to the general process of genome degradation observed in B. ovis. A case of special interest is the B. ovis-specific island (see above), where a 25 kb region between two copies of IS711 in B. ovis is absent in all the other sequenced species, suggestive of either deletion by recombination between the two copies in the other Brucella species, or of acquisition of the region with duplication of IS711.  Pseudogenes  It has been proposed that the unique complement of pseudogenes in each of the Brucella species may contribute to their differing degrees of infectivity and host preference [21], [22]. Interestingly B. abortus, which is less virulent for humans than B. suis and B. melitensis, has a greater number of pseudogenes (316) than B. suis 1330 (62) or B. melitensis 16M (163) (Table 1). Similar to B. abortus, the B. ovis genome contains a large number of pseudogenes with 244 identified. The small chromosome contains more pseudogenes (125; 11.3%) than the large chromosome (119; 5.7%) (Table 1). Of the 244 B. ovis pseudogenes, 40 are hypothetical or conserved hypothetical genes, 62 have predicted transport functions, 23 are defective transposases, and 14 are predicted to have regulatory functions. The finding that some pseudogenes in the B. melitensis flagellar region encode full-length proteins raises the question of whether some pseudogenes in B. ovis may also be functional [35].  Metabolism  Urease  Based on biotyping, B. ovis is urease-negative. However it contains the two urease clusters described in all the other sequenced Brucella genomes. Urease has been reported to be important for the ability of B. abortus  [36] and B. suis  [37] to survive passage through the stomach in the mouse model of infection. The importance of urease for oral infection is consistent with a lack of human infections observed with B. ovis, despite identification of this organism in the milk of infected ewes [38]. The ure1 cluster is the only one showing urease activity at least in B. abortus, B. melitensis, and B. suis  [36], [37], while the ure2 does not have any demonstrable urease activity. The ure1 cluster of B. ovis contains several point mutations that are predicted to result in conserved changes shared by at least one other urease positive species. However, UreC1 contains a 30 bp deletion that would cause a loss of 10 amino acids in UreC1. Although all the residues described to be important for enzymatic activity of UreC1 are conserved [39], this deletion must render the urease inactive. Moreover, complementation with the ureC1 gene from B. melitensis (Sangari, unpublished results) results in urease activity. Regarding the ure2 cluster, ureF2 (BOV_1316) and ureT (BOV_1319) are pseudogenes, while the remaining genes are conserved, suggesting that this cluster could encode an unknown activity.  Sugar metabolism  B. ovis is defective in oxidative metabolism of arabinose, galactose, ribose, xylose, glucose and erythritol [40]. Analysis of the genome sequence reveals a possible basis for these metabolic defects in B. ovis relative to the human pathogenic Brucella species. Several putative sugar transporters predicted to be functional in other Brucella species appear to be inactivated by frameshifts, point mutations or gene degradation in B. ovis. Further, pckA encoding phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (BOV_2009) is inactivated by frameshift, which would affect the gluconeogenesis pathway and the ability of B. ovis to utilize pyruvate, amino acids, or glycerol as carbon sources.  Erythritol  Erythritol is the preferred carbon source of B. abortus  [41], [42]. Erythritol is metabolized in Brucella by the enzymes encoded in the eryABCD operon[43] Moreover, it has been recently described that the carbohydrate transport system located upstream of the ery operon constitutes the erythritol transport system in Rhizobium leguminosarum bv. Viciae  [44], and that the operon immediately downstream also forms part of the erythritol catabolic pathway. Microarray experiments have revealed that these three operons are regulated by erythritol in B. abortus, reinforcing that the three clusters participate in erythritol catabolism (Sangari et al, unpublished). B. ovis does not oxidize erythritol, and it is not inhibited by its presence in the growth media. This is reflected in the genome by the presence of a stop codon in eryA (BOV_A0811) and a frameshift in eryD (BOV_A0814) that render them pseudogenes. In addition two genes of the putative ABC erythritol transport system, eryF and eryG (BOV_A805 and BOV_A806)) carry mutations that render them pseudogenes (a 2 bp deletion resulting in an premature stop codon). The mutation in eryD could have an effect in the over expression of all genes of the ery system. On the contrary, mutations in the transport genes and in eryA block the entry of erythritol in the cell and its phosphorylation, avoiding the accumulation of toxic intermediates and the depletion of ATP observed in the vaccine strain S19 [45]. The accumulation of mutations in these two clusters suggest that they may no longer be needed by B. ovis. The third cluster is intact, and the enzymes use substrates that are central (or core) carbohydrate metabolites such as dihydroxyacetone phosphate, glyceraldehydes-3-phosphate, and other three carbon compounds that can be produced after decarboxylation of erythritol and its derivatives.  While it has been hypothesized that erythritol may serve as a carbon source during growth of B. abortus, B. suis, and B. melitensis in the placenta of their natural hosts, an analysis of deletion mutants in these models has not been reported. However, the lower incidence of abortion in sheep flocks infected with B. ovis compared to B. melitensis correlates with the inability of B. ovis to use erythritol as a carbon source. Mutants in eryB and eryC have been described to have a limited ability to grow in macrophages [46]. This limitation may well contribute to the limited virulence of B. ovis.  Glucose and Galactose  Unlike B. melitensis, B. abortus and B. suis, B. ovis is unable to grow on glucose or galactose as a primary carbon source [40]. Analysis of genes involved in uptake and utilization of these carbon sources reveals that B. ovis gluP (BOV_A0172), encoding a glucose/galactose transporter [47] is a pseudogene. B. abortus gluP mutants have a reduced ability to persist in the spleens of mice [48], suggesting that the ability to utilize these carbon sources may be important for systemic persistence of the human pathogenic Brucella species. However B. suis also lacks GluP and is able to oxidize glucose and galactose, suggesting that additional functions are lacking in B. ovis that contribute to utilization of these carbon sources. Several predicted sugar ABC transporters (BOV_1299-BOV1301, BOV_A0278-BOV_A0282, BOV_A0645-BOV_A0648 and BOV_A1083-BOV_A1086) of unknown specificity contain pseudogenes, which may potentially reduce the ability of B. ovis to take up glucose and galactose.  Ribose  Two components, a permease and an ATP binding protein of a putative ribose ABC transport system (BOV_A0936-BOV_A0937) are pseudogenes in B. ovis, suggesting that the inability of B. ovis to utilize ribose as a sole carbon source may be the result of a reduced capacity to take up ribose from the growth medium. Similarly, a periplasmic binding protein and an ATP binding protein of a predicted ABC transporter for xylose (BOV_A1055-BOVA1056) contain frameshifts, which may underlie the inability of B. ovis to utilize xylose [40].  Oxidase phenotype  B. ovis is the only Brucella species with a negative oxidase phenotype. Oxidase phenotype depends on the activity of cytochrome C oxidase which in B. suis is encoded by at least 7 genes, four of them organized in one operon, BR0363-BR0360 (ccoNOQP), together with BR0467 (coxB), encoding cytochrome c oxidase, subunit II, BR0468 (coxA) encoding cytochrome c oxidase, subunit I and BR0472 (coxC) encoding cytochrome c oxidase, subunit III. In B. ovis, the operon ccoNOQP (BOV_0376-BOV_0379), encoding the cb type cytochrome c oxidase is well conserved, except the gene ccoO (BOV_0378), which contains a frameshift generated by deletion of an A near its 5′ end, is a pseudogene. The B. ovis coxB gene (BOV_0473) contains a frameshift that very probably inactivates the gene, while coxA (BOV_0474) differs only in two residues with the B. suis product. The last 6 amino acids of coxC (BOV_0478) are lost as result of a short deletion (56 bp) that fuses this product with the next, apparently unrelated Orf. A short repeated sequence (GGGGCGGC) at both ends of the deletion seems to be responsible for this rearrangement. These genomic differences may be responsible for the oxidase negative phenotype of B. ovis.  Nitrogen metabolism  Several genes encoded in the B. suis genome with inferred functions in nitrogen metabolism are not predicted to be functional in the B. ovis genome. The genes norB (BOV_A0225), encoding the large subunit of nitric oxide reductase, and nosX (BOV_A0256), a gene of unknown function in the operon encoding nitric oxide synthase, are pseudogenes in B. ovis. The third gene, narK (BOV_A0276), encoding a nitrite extrusion protein, is degenerate, as was found in the B. melitensis and B. abortus 2308 genomes [21]. Nitric oxide reductase is required for survival and persistence of B. suis in mice [49], suggesting that lack of this activity in B. ovis may contribute to its restricted tissue tropism and host range.  A locus that contributes to growth of E. coli on aspartate as a nitrogen source, xanthine dehydrogenase (BOV_0365-BOV_0367;  [50]) contains a pseudogene in B. ovis, suggesting a further defect in nitrogen metabolism. Further, this locus could function in salvage pathways for purine nucleotides, which could contribute to nitrogen metabolism. A correlation between a defective purine nucleotide salvage pathway and reduced ability of B. ovis to survive intracellularly would be consistent with the importance of purine biosynthetic pathways for full virulence of B. abortus and B. melitensis  [51], [52]. Further, a homolog of Sinorhizobium meliloti fixI (BOV_0373), encoding an cation pump involved in symbiotic nitrogen fixation [53], is inactivated by a point mutation in the B. ovis genome. As the function of the fixGHI genes in Brucella spp. has not been determined, the biological significance of this gene inactivation for B. ovis is currently unknown.  Host-pathogen interactions  Lipopolysaccharide  B. ovis is known to have a rough LPS phenotype, which given the critical role of O-antigen in pathogenicity of B. abortus, B. suis and B. melitensis, likely contributes to its reduced pathogenicity for laboratory animals compared to other Brucella spp. [8], [54], [55]. As mentioned above, the wboA gene is missing from B. ovis, as well as a second, genetically linked glycosyltransferase. Pseudogenes with a possible function in LPS biosynthesis include a glycosyltransferase (BOV_A0475), an LpxA family acetyltransferase (BOV_A0367) and a putative undecaprenylphosphate alpha-N-acetylglucosamine transferase (BOV_A0371) of which the latter may also be involved in murein biosynthesis. While it is known that B. ovis LPS has a higher affinity for antimicrobial peptides than that of B. abortus, it is unknown whether differences in LPS structure compared to smooth Brucella species affect the interaction of B. ovis LPS with toll-like receptors of the innate immune system [56], [57].  Type IV secretion system (T4SS)  The T4SS, encoded by virB1-virB12, is an essential virulence factor in B. abortus, B. suis, and B. melitensis  [48], [58]–[60]. The genes virB1-VirB12 are intact in the B. ovis genome, suggesting that this system is functional. Further, the gene encoding its transcriptional activator VjbR (BOVA_0110;  [61]) is conserved. These findings are consistent with the detection of VirB5 and VirB8 expression in B. ovis  [62]. Two co-regulated genes identified as encoding T4SS substrates, vceA (BOV_1577) and vceC (BOV_1003) are present in B. ovis, however it is currently unknown whether there may be additional T4SS effectors in other Brucella spp. that are absent from B. ovis  [63]. A recent report showing that B. ovis strain PA is able to replicate in macrophages and HeLa cells at a rate similar to that of B. abortus suggests that its T4SS is functional [64].  Autotransporter proteins  Four predicted autotransporters have been identified in the sequenced Brucella genomes. Each of the sequenced Brucella genomes is predicted to encode a different combination of autotransporters [21], suggesting that none of these four proteins is essential for virulence, but that different combinations of autotransporters may contribute to observed differences in tissue tropism and host preference. The B. ovis genome is predicted to encode three functional autotransporters, corresponding to B. suis BR0072, BRA0173 and BRA1148, (BOV_0071, BOV_A0152 and BOV_A1053) while the fourth gene, BOV_1937, corresponding to BR2013, is degenerate. These proteins show a range in similarity (at the amino acid level) to their B. suis counterparts, from 99% between BRA1148 and BOV_A1053, to 86% similarity between BOV_A0152 and BRA0173. BR2013, designated omaA, is a pseudogene in both B. abortus and B. melitensis, and was noted to have a polymorphism with unknown functional effects in the genome of vaccine strain B. abortus 19 [65]. Since the product of this gene has been shown to contribute to persistence of B. suis in mice [66], it is possible that lack of a functional OmaA autotransporter in B. ovis may contribute to its limited tissue tropism and host range. However, the finding that all four autotransporter genes are predicted to be pseudogenes in B. melitensis, shows that they are not absolutely required for infectivity and transmission.  Immunomodulatory functions  In addition to the T4SS, several genes implicated in modulation of the immune response by Brucella spp., are well-conserved in B. ovis ATCC25840. These include btp1, encoding the TIR domain protein, an inhibitor of TLR2 signaling, the B cell mitogen encoded by prpA, and cyclic β-glucan synthase [67]–[70].  Outer membrane proteins  The two component regulator BvrR/BvrS, which has been shown to be a master regulator of many virulence-associated functions [71], [72], appears intact in B. ovis. However, a putative envZ osmosensor (BOV_A0412) is a pseudogene. Two genes shown to encode outer membrane proteins in other Brucella species omp2a (BOV_0632  [73]) and omp31 (BOV_1565; [74]), contain point mutations in B. ovis. For Omp31, the point mutation is predicted to lead to a truncation in the protein. It was found previously that the outer membrane of B. ovis is more susceptible to cationic peptides than a rough B. abortus mutant [56], suggesting that together with the defects in LPS biosynthesis discussed above, these defects in outer membrane components may further compromise the cell envelope stability of B. ovis making it less able to survive environmental stresses.  Perspective  The unique biology of Brucella ovis compared to the human pathogenic species appears to be in part the result of genome degradation. Worldwide, the majority of human brucellosis cases occur via ingestion of contaminated dairy products. B. ovis is not known to cause human infection, despite worldwide consumption of unpasteurized sheep's milk, where B. ovis has been detected [38]. Oral transmission, although feasible in experimental conditions, does not appear to be one of the main routes of infection for B. ovis, whereas passive venereal transmission via the ewe is the most important one [75]. This suggests that this species has lost the ability to infect via the oral route. One genomic change that may contribute to this loss of oral infectivity is the loss of an important virulence factor, urease, that is required for survival of stomach acidity by Brucella spp [36], [37]. Urease has also been shown to contribute to the establishment of Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae infection in pigs through the respiratory tract [76]. If this mechanism is also operative in Brucella spp., then it is possible that B. ovis is also deficient in establishing infections not only by the digestive route but also via aerosol inhalation, which are the two main routes of infection by human pathogenic Brucella spp. Additional genes that seem to be non-functional in B. ovis could also contribute to reduce the number of transmission routes compared to other Brucella species. A characteristic of B. ovis is its tropism for the ovine male genital tract, which presents as epididymo-orchitis [8]. Since other Brucella species, especially B. melitensis are known to cause epididymo-orchitis in human patients [77], the predilection of B. ovis to cause epididymo-orchitis in rams likely represents a loss of functions required to target to other tissues. However, due to the large number of genes in the B. ovis genome with unknown function, a gain of functions that allow for increased colonization of the male genital tract cannot be ruled out based on the genome sequence.

PMC2677664,Abstract,Abstract,NC_004311,1,0,0,,,"  Brucella ovis is a veterinary pathogen associated with epididymitis in sheep. Despite its genetic similarity to the zoonotic pathogens B. abortus, B. melitensis and B. suis, B. ovis does not cause zoonotic disease. Genomic analysis of the type strain ATCC25840 revealed a high percentage of pseudogenes and increased numbers of transposable elements compared to the zoonotic Brucella species, suggesting that genome degradation has occurred concomitant with narrowing of the host range of B. ovis. The absence of genomic island 2, encoding functions required for lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis, as well as inactivation of genes encoding urease, nutrient uptake and utilization, and outer membrane proteins may be factors contributing to the avirulence of B. ovis for humans. A 26.5 kb region of B. ovis ATCC25840 Chromosome II was absent from all the sequenced human pathogenic Brucella genomes, but was present in all of 17 B. ovis isolates tested and in three B. ceti isolates, suggesting that this DNA region may be of use for differentiating B. ovis from other Brucella spp. This is the first genomic analysis of a non-zoonotic Brucella species. The results suggest that inactivation of genes involved in nutrient acquisition and utilization, cell envelope structure and urease may have played a role in narrowing of the tissue tropism and host range of B. ovis.

PMC2677664,Introduction,Introduction,NC_004311,0,1,0,,,"  Introduction  Although previous studies have supported the notion of Brucella as a monospecies genus with different biotypes [1], it is still largely accepted that the genus Brucella is divided into six species, named according to their preferential hosts. Each one of the species is host-adapted, but not host-restricted [2]–[4]. Four of the six Brucella species, namely B. melitensis, B. abortus, B. suis, and B. canis, are capable of causing human disease. B. melitensis and B. suis are the most pathogenic, whereas B. abortus is considered of moderate pathogenicity, and B. canis is considered of low pathogenicity for humans. There are no reports of human infections with B. ovis or B. neotomae  [3]. In addition to the six classical Brucella species, Brucella has also been isolated from marine mammals, and two species, B. pinnipedialis and B. ceti have been proposed [5]. Brucella isolates from marine mammals can cause human infections, with one reported case of infection due to laboratory exposure [6], and two reported cases of natural infections resulting in neurological disease [7].  Brucella ovis was initially recognized in the beginning of the 1950's in New Zealand and Australia as a bacterial agent associated with epididymitis and abortion in sheep [8]. Since then this organism has been isolated in several countries [9], and is considered one of the most important causes of ovine infertility, with a significant economic impact on the sheep industry [10]. B. ovis has a worldwide distribution in areas where sheep are economically significant, with the exception of the Great Britain [9]. The prevalence in herds ranges from 9.1 to 46.7% [11], and the seroprevalence within positive herds varies between 2.1 to 67% [11]–[14].  B. ovis is stably rough, and it is one of the two classical Brucella species that do not have zoonotic potential. In sheep, the organism causes either clinical or sub-clinical chronic infections characterized by epididymitis, orchitis, male infertility, and occasionally abortion in pregnant ewes [15]. Sexually mature rams are more susceptible than young males [16]. However, B. ovis infection may affect males as young as 4 months old [9]. Natural transmission apparently occurs through mucosal membranes, and venereal transmission is significant when a female previously mated with an infected male copulates with a second susceptible male during the same period of estrus [17]. Upon invasion through mucosal membranes, B. ovis initially resides in local lymph nodes, which is followed by bacteremia and finally colonization of the genital tract around 30 days post infection [18]. The factors defining the genital tropism of this organism remain unknown.  Sequencing of B. melitensis, and B. suis genomes demonstrated a high level of similarity between the two genomes, with over 90% of the genes having more than 98–100% nucleotide identity [19]. Furthermore, comparison between these two species resulted in the identification of only 32 and 43 genes that were unique to B. melitensis and B. suis, respectively. This level of variability is remarkably low even when compared to variations between serotypes within the same bacterial species such as in serotypes Typhi and Typhimurium of Samonella enterica  [20]. More recently, the complete genome sequence of B. abortus (strains 9–941 and 2308) became available confirming the striking similarity both among different species of Brucella and within the species B. abortus  [21], [22]. Comparisons between these three Brucella species revealed more than 94% identity at the nucleotide level. In addition, comparisons between the genomes of the two B. abortus strains that have been sequenced (9–941 and 2308) resulted in identification of only a small number of strain-specific deletions and polymorphisms [21]. The genetic similarity among Brucella species has been confirmed by whole genome hybridizations [23]. Together these studies support the original hybridization studies performed more than 20 years ago suggesting that Brucella is a monospecific genus from the genetic point of view [1]. Considering the high level of identity among Brucella species pathogenic to humans, the comparison of those species with a Brucella lacking the potential to cause human infections may bring new insights into host specificity and pathogenesis. In this study we present the genome analysis of the rough non-human-pathogen Brucella ovis and compare its genome with those of the zoonotic Brucella spp. Our analysis focused on two sets of genomic features (i) deletions and gene degradation that could potentially result in loss of virulence factors important for infection of hosts other than sheep, and (ii) B. ovis-specific genes that could contribute to genital tract tropism or cause a reduction in virulence for non-ovine hosts.

PMC2677664,Materials and Methods,Materials and Methods,NC_004311,1,0,0,,,"  Materials and Methods  Genome sequencing and annotation  The complete genome sequence of Brucella ovis strain ATCC25840 was determined using the whole-genome shotgun method as previously described [78]. Physical and sequencing gaps were closed using a combination of primer walking, generation and sequencing of transposon-tagged libraries of large-insert clones, and multiplex PCR [79]. Identification of putative protein-encoding genes and annotation of the genome were performed as previously described [24]. An initial set of genes predicted to encode proteins was identified with GLIMMER [80]. Genes consisting of fewer than 30 codons and those containing overlaps were eliminated. Frame shifts and point mutations were corrected or designated ‘authentic.’ Functional assignment, identification of membrane-spanning domains, and determination of paralogous gene families were performed as previously described [24]. Sequence alignments and phylogenetic trees were generated using the methods described previously [24].  Trinucleotide composition  Distribution of all 64 trinucleotides (3-mers) was determined, and the 3-mer distribution in 1,000-bp windows that overlapped by half their length (500 bp) across the genome was computed. For each window, we computed the χ2 statistic on the difference between its 3-mer content and that of the whole chromosome. A large value for indicates the 3-mer composition in this window is different from the rest of the chromosome (minimum of two standard deviations). Probability values for this analysis are based on assumptions that the DNA composition is relatively uniform throughout the genome, and that 3-mer composition is independent. Because these assumptions may be incorrect, we prefer to interpret high χ2 values as indicators of regions on the chromosome that appear unusual and demand further scrutiny.  Comparative genomics  The B. ovis ATCC25840 genome was compared to the genomes of B. suis 1330, B. abortus 2308, B. abortus 9-941, and B. melitensis 16M (PATRIC), at the nucleotide level by suffix tree analysis using MUMmer [81], and the predicted B. ovis CDSs were compared with the gene sets from the other sequenced Brucella genomes by BLAST and by HMM paralogous family searches, as previously described [82].  Analysis of the B. ovis-specific island  Genomic DNA from B. ovis strains and other Brucella species (B. melitensis, B. suis, B. abortus, B. canis, B. neotomae, and B. pinnipedialis) were subjected to PCR amplification of 12 target sequences within the B. ovis-specific island. PCR reactions were performed using 13 µL of a commercial PCR mix (PCR Supermix, Invitrogen, USA), 0.75 µL of a 25 µM solution of each primer (Supplementary Table S1), and 1 µL of DNA (100 to 500 ng per reaction). Cycling parameters were denaturation at 95°C for 5 minutes; 35 cycles of denaturation (95°C for 1 min seconds), annealing (55°C for 1 min), and extension (72°C for 1 min); and a final extension at 72°C for 5 min. PCR products were resolved by agarose gel electrophoresis.

PMC2677664,Results and Discussion,Results and Discussion,NC_004311,1,1,0,,,"  Results and Discussion  General features of the B. ovis genome  The B. ovis type strain ATCC25840 (also known as 63/290 or NCTC10512) used for sequencing was isolated from a sheep in Australia in 1960 [8]. The genome of this strain consists of two circular chromosomes of 2,111,370 bp (Chromosome I; NCBI Accession Number NC_009505) and 1,164,220 bp (Chromosome II; NCBI Accession Number NC_009504), which are predicted to encode a total of 2890 proteins, 1928 on ChrI and 962 on ChrII (Table 1). Features of the B. ovis genome are summarized in Table 1. Comparison with the sequenced genomes of B. suis (GenBank Accession numbers NC_004310 and NC_004311) [24], B. abortus (GenBank Accession numbers NC_007618 and NC_007624) [21], [22] and B. melitensis 16M (GenBank Accession numbers NC_003317 and NC_003318) [19] shows a large degree of conservation, particularly in the % G+C content and size of the chromosomes. This comparison also revealed several species-specific differences, including regions missing from B. ovis relative to the other sequenced Brucella genomes and genes unique to B. ovis. These differences are listed in Table 1 and Figures 1–2, and are discussed below.  10.1371/journal.pone.0005519.g001  Figure 1  Whole genome alignment of sequenced Brucella strains.  The five genomes were compared to each other by using COG, BLAST and HMM analyses. Each genome is colored with a gradient that ranges from yellow (nucleotide 1) to blue (end). Differences in color between a reference sequence (the bottom colored line in each set) and the other genomes indicate conserved protein-coding regions that have been rearranged. Uncolored segments denote coding regions in which no conserved genes were detected. The curves on top of each panel represent the nucleotide composition (Χ2 analysis) (see   Materials and Methods  ) of the reference strain of the panel, and peaks indicate regions of atypical composition.  10.1371/journal.pone.0005519.g002  Figure 2  Map of the B. ovis-specific island on Chromosome II, which resembles a composite transposon.

Comparative best-match blastp searches identified 2282 annotated proteins in B. ovis that are shared with B. suis, B. melitensis and B. abortus, 79% of the annotated proteome. Nonetheless, this analysis suggested that the B. ovis genome lacks 675, 610 and 539 protein coding genes annotated in B. suis, B. melitensis and B. abortus 2308, respectively (Table S3). To determine whether these genes are truly absent from the B. ovis genome they were compared to the B. ovis chromosomal sequences using blastn searches. Interestingly, good matches were found for 64, 125 and 18 genes thought to be lacking in B. ovis in the genomes of B. suis, B. melitensis and B. abortus 2308, respectively (Table S3). There are several possible reasons for these genes not being highlighted as shared using comparative best-match blastp searches, e.g., they may be pseudogenes in B. ovis and therefore, not part of the predicted proteome, they may be the products of duplications where only one duplication product is matched in best match searches or differences in gene annotation between the strains resulted in these sequences not being annotated as a protein coding gene in B. ovis. In total only 33 annotated protein coding genes in B. ovis are unique to this species.  Genomic rearrangements  Gradient figures were used to compare the chromosomes of B. ovis with those of the other sequenced Brucella genomes. No large inversions or rearrangements were observed in the B. ovis genome compared to the sequenced genomes of B. suis or B. melitensis (Figure 1).  Genomic deletions  Chromosome I  Four deletions of 4 kb or larger were identified in the B. ovis genome, compared to its closest relative, B. suis. Chromosome I lacks a 15 kb region that encompasses B. suis BR0966-BR0987. Interestingly, in B. suis, this region is inserted into the sequence of tRNAgly and is adjacent to a phage integrase-like gene, features suggestive of horizontal gene transfer. This region contains the wboA glycosyl transferase gene, shown to be essential for lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis [25], and a second glycosyl transferase, as well as several hypothetical proteins. The lack of the two glycosyl transferases likely contributes to the rough LPS phenotype of B. ovis. These findings were in agreement with previous reports by Vizcaino et al and Rajashekara et al [23], [26] showing the absence of these genes from B. ovis.  A second deletion on Chromosome I of 7745 bp encompasses BR1078-BR1083. This island in B. suis contains three hypothetical genes and two site specific recombinases and is flanked by two tRNA-Leu genes, of which one remains in B. ovis. A smaller deletion of 3954 bp on Chromosome I has led to loss of two genes (BR1852-BR1853) encoding a transcriptional regulator and a protein predicted to be a branched chain amino acid permease. This deletion is also associated with transposable elements, as these two genes in B. suis are flanked by copies of IS2020  [27], one of which remains in B. ovis.  Chromosome II  The 44.5 kb island in B. suis (BRA1074-BRA1113; [28]), containing four predicted ABC transport systems and three transcriptional regulators, is absent from the B. ovis genome. The presence of two copies of IS1239 flanking two pseudogenes in B. ovis suggests that this is the result of a loss of this region by recombination.  The 18.3 kb IncP island on B. suis Chromosome II containing BRA0362-BRA0379, previously reported to be present in B. suis biovars 1–4, B. canis, B. neotomae, and marine mammal isolates but missing in B. melitensis  [24], [28], is also absent from the B. ovis genome, as reported by Lavigne and colleagues [28].  Unique genomic regions  Chromosome II, contains an island of 26.5 kb (BOV_A0482-BOV_A0515) with structure suggestive of a composite transposon (Fig. 2). This island likely overlaps the B. ovis-specific 21-kb SpeI fragment of the small chromosome identified previously by genome mapping [29]. Proteins encoded on the island include transposases, an ABC transporter, a putative hemagglutinin, and several hypothetical proteins. This region is present in 17/17 B. ovis strains tested, suggesting a high level of conservation within the species (Supplementary Table S2). Interestingly, the predicted product of BOV_A0497 exhibits similarity to antitoxins of toxin-antitoxin maintenance systems [30], suggesting a possible selective pressure for maintenance of this genetic island in B. ovis. Genome sequence data and analysis of the island by PCR showed that this region is absent from the genomes of B. suis, B. abortus, B. melitensis, B. canis and B. neotomae (Table 2), suggesting initially that it may be specific to B. ovis. However, we detected this island in three marine isolates of Brucella from captive bottlenose dolphins [31], [32]. The protein coding genes within this unique region constitute the majority of the unique protein coding genes in B. ovis (Supplementary Table S3).  10.1371/journal.pone.0005519.t002  Table 2  Detection of the B. ovis genomic island in Brucella species  Species  ORF  Brucella ovis  B. melitensis  B. abortus  B. suis  B. canis  B. neotomae  B. ceti (Muu)  B. ceti (Cudo)  B. ceti (Nor)  NTC1  A0492  +  −  −  −  −  −  +  +  +  −  A0495  +  −  −  −  −  −  +  +  +  −  A0496  +  −  −  −  −  −  +  +  +  −  A0497  +  −  −  −  −  −  +  +  +  −  A0500  +  −  −  −  −  −  +  +  +  −  A0502  +  −  −  −  −  −  +  +  +  −  A0503  +  −  −  −  −  −  +  +  +  −  A0504  +  −  −  −  −  −  +  +  +  −  A0505  +  −  −  −  −  −  +  +  +  −  A0506  +  −  −  −  −  −  +  +  +  −  A0511  +  −  −  −  −  −  +  +  +  −  A0512  +  −  −  −  −  −  +  +  +  −  BR06152  +  +  +  +  +  +  +  +  +  −  1  NTC, no template control  2  Positive control for amplification reaction  Transposable elements  The genome of B. ovis contains 38 complete copies of IS711, confirming previous estimates obtained by hybridization [33]. 25 of the copies are located in Chromosome I, and 13 in Chromosome II. Interestingly, several of these copies appear to be expanded clonally, suggesting that they could be active in B. ovis. In 17 cases, IS711 is inserted in copies of a repeated sequence of the BruRS family [34]. Five of the IS711 copies appear to disrupt genes, which could be a contributing factor to the general process of genome degradation observed in B. ovis. A case of special interest is the B. ovis-specific island (see above), where a 25 kb region between two copies of IS711 in B. ovis is absent in all the other sequenced species, suggestive of either deletion by recombination between the two copies in the other Brucella species, or of acquisition of the region with duplication of IS711.  Pseudogenes  It has been proposed that the unique complement of pseudogenes in each of the Brucella species may contribute to their differing degrees of infectivity and host preference [21], [22]. Interestingly B. abortus, which is less virulent for humans than B. suis and B. melitensis, has a greater number of pseudogenes (316) than B. suis 1330 (62) or B. melitensis 16M (163) (Table 1). Similar to B. abortus, the B. ovis genome contains a large number of pseudogenes with 244 identified. The small chromosome contains more pseudogenes (125; 11.3%) than the large chromosome (119; 5.7%) (Table 1). Of the 244 B. ovis pseudogenes, 40 are hypothetical or conserved hypothetical genes, 62 have predicted transport functions, 23 are defective transposases, and 14 are predicted to have regulatory functions. The finding that some pseudogenes in the B. melitensis flagellar region encode full-length proteins raises the question of whether some pseudogenes in B. ovis may also be functional [35].  Metabolism  Urease  Based on biotyping, B. ovis is urease-negative. However it contains the two urease clusters described in all the other sequenced Brucella genomes. Urease has been reported to be important for the ability of B. abortus  [36] and B. suis  [37] to survive passage through the stomach in the mouse model of infection. The importance of urease for oral infection is consistent with a lack of human infections observed with B. ovis, despite identification of this organism in the milk of infected ewes [38]. The ure1 cluster is the only one showing urease activity at least in B. abortus, B. melitensis, and B. suis  [36], [37], while the ure2 does not have any demonstrable urease activity. The ure1 cluster of B. ovis contains several point mutations that are predicted to result in conserved changes shared by at least one other urease positive species. However, UreC1 contains a 30 bp deletion that would cause a loss of 10 amino acids in UreC1. Although all the residues described to be important for enzymatic activity of UreC1 are conserved [39], this deletion must render the urease inactive. Moreover, complementation with the ureC1 gene from B. melitensis (Sangari, unpublished results) results in urease activity. Regarding the ure2 cluster, ureF2 (BOV_1316) and ureT (BOV_1319) are pseudogenes, while the remaining genes are conserved, suggesting that this cluster could encode an unknown activity.  Sugar metabolism  B. ovis is defective in oxidative metabolism of arabinose, galactose, ribose, xylose, glucose and erythritol [40]. Analysis of the genome sequence reveals a possible basis for these metabolic defects in B. ovis relative to the human pathogenic Brucella species. Several putative sugar transporters predicted to be functional in other Brucella species appear to be inactivated by frameshifts, point mutations or gene degradation in B. ovis. Further, pckA encoding phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (BOV_2009) is inactivated by frameshift, which would affect the gluconeogenesis pathway and the ability of B. ovis to utilize pyruvate, amino acids, or glycerol as carbon sources.  Erythritol  Erythritol is the preferred carbon source of B. abortus  [41], [42]. Erythritol is metabolized in Brucella by the enzymes encoded in the eryABCD operon[43] Moreover, it has been recently described that the carbohydrate transport system located upstream of the ery operon constitutes the erythritol transport system in Rhizobium leguminosarum bv. Viciae  [44], and that the operon immediately downstream also forms part of the erythritol catabolic pathway. Microarray experiments have revealed that these three operons are regulated by erythritol in B. abortus, reinforcing that the three clusters participate in erythritol catabolism (Sangari et al, unpublished). B. ovis does not oxidize erythritol, and it is not inhibited by its presence in the growth media. This is reflected in the genome by the presence of a stop codon in eryA (BOV_A0811) and a frameshift in eryD (BOV_A0814) that render them pseudogenes. In addition two genes of the putative ABC erythritol transport system, eryF and eryG (BOV_A805 and BOV_A806)) carry mutations that render them pseudogenes (a 2 bp deletion resulting in an premature stop codon). The mutation in eryD could have an effect in the over expression of all genes of the ery system. On the contrary, mutations in the transport genes and in eryA block the entry of erythritol in the cell and its phosphorylation, avoiding the accumulation of toxic intermediates and the depletion of ATP observed in the vaccine strain S19 [45]. The accumulation of mutations in these two clusters suggest that they may no longer be needed by B. ovis. The third cluster is intact, and the enzymes use substrates that are central (or core) carbohydrate metabolites such as dihydroxyacetone phosphate, glyceraldehydes-3-phosphate, and other three carbon compounds that can be produced after decarboxylation of erythritol and its derivatives.  While it has been hypothesized that erythritol may serve as a carbon source during growth of B. abortus, B. suis, and B. melitensis in the placenta of their natural hosts, an analysis of deletion mutants in these models has not been reported. However, the lower incidence of abortion in sheep flocks infected with B. ovis compared to B. melitensis correlates with the inability of B. ovis to use erythritol as a carbon source. Mutants in eryB and eryC have been described to have a limited ability to grow in macrophages [46]. This limitation may well contribute to the limited virulence of B. ovis.  Glucose and Galactose  Unlike B. melitensis, B. abortus and B. suis, B. ovis is unable to grow on glucose or galactose as a primary carbon source [40]. Analysis of genes involved in uptake and utilization of these carbon sources reveals that B. ovis gluP (BOV_A0172), encoding a glucose/galactose transporter [47] is a pseudogene. B. abortus gluP mutants have a reduced ability to persist in the spleens of mice [48], suggesting that the ability to utilize these carbon sources may be important for systemic persistence of the human pathogenic Brucella species. However B. suis also lacks GluP and is able to oxidize glucose and galactose, suggesting that additional functions are lacking in B. ovis that contribute to utilization of these carbon sources. Several predicted sugar ABC transporters (BOV_1299-BOV1301, BOV_A0278-BOV_A0282, BOV_A0645-BOV_A0648 and BOV_A1083-BOV_A1086) of unknown specificity contain pseudogenes, which may potentially reduce the ability of B. ovis to take up glucose and galactose.  Ribose  Two components, a permease and an ATP binding protein of a putative ribose ABC transport system (BOV_A0936-BOV_A0937) are pseudogenes in B. ovis, suggesting that the inability of B. ovis to utilize ribose as a sole carbon source may be the result of a reduced capacity to take up ribose from the growth medium. Similarly, a periplasmic binding protein and an ATP binding protein of a predicted ABC transporter for xylose (BOV_A1055-BOVA1056) contain frameshifts, which may underlie the inability of B. ovis to utilize xylose [40].  Oxidase phenotype  B. ovis is the only Brucella species with a negative oxidase phenotype. Oxidase phenotype depends on the activity of cytochrome C oxidase which in B. suis is encoded by at least 7 genes, four of them organized in one operon, BR0363-BR0360 (ccoNOQP), together with BR0467 (coxB), encoding cytochrome c oxidase, subunit II, BR0468 (coxA) encoding cytochrome c oxidase, subunit I and BR0472 (coxC) encoding cytochrome c oxidase, subunit III. In B. ovis, the operon ccoNOQP (BOV_0376-BOV_0379), encoding the cb type cytochrome c oxidase is well conserved, except the gene ccoO (BOV_0378), which contains a frameshift generated by deletion of an A near its 5′ end, is a pseudogene. The B. ovis coxB gene (BOV_0473) contains a frameshift that very probably inactivates the gene, while coxA (BOV_0474) differs only in two residues with the B. suis product. The last 6 amino acids of coxC (BOV_0478) are lost as result of a short deletion (56 bp) that fuses this product with the next, apparently unrelated Orf. A short repeated sequence (GGGGCGGC) at both ends of the deletion seems to be responsible for this rearrangement. These genomic differences may be responsible for the oxidase negative phenotype of B. ovis.  Nitrogen metabolism  Several genes encoded in the B. suis genome with inferred functions in nitrogen metabolism are not predicted to be functional in the B. ovis genome. The genes norB (BOV_A0225), encoding the large subunit of nitric oxide reductase, and nosX (BOV_A0256), a gene of unknown function in the operon encoding nitric oxide synthase, are pseudogenes in B. ovis. The third gene, narK (BOV_A0276), encoding a nitrite extrusion protein, is degenerate, as was found in the B. melitensis and B. abortus 2308 genomes [21]. Nitric oxide reductase is required for survival and persistence of B. suis in mice [49], suggesting that lack of this activity in B. ovis may contribute to its restricted tissue tropism and host range.  A locus that contributes to growth of E. coli on aspartate as a nitrogen source, xanthine dehydrogenase (BOV_0365-BOV_0367;  [50]) contains a pseudogene in B. ovis, suggesting a further defect in nitrogen metabolism. Further, this locus could function in salvage pathways for purine nucleotides, which could contribute to nitrogen metabolism. A correlation between a defective purine nucleotide salvage pathway and reduced ability of B. ovis to survive intracellularly would be consistent with the importance of purine biosynthetic pathways for full virulence of B. abortus and B. melitensis  [51], [52]. Further, a homolog of Sinorhizobium meliloti fixI (BOV_0373), encoding an cation pump involved in symbiotic nitrogen fixation [53], is inactivated by a point mutation in the B. ovis genome. As the function of the fixGHI genes in Brucella spp. has not been determined, the biological significance of this gene inactivation for B. ovis is currently unknown.  Host-pathogen interactions  Lipopolysaccharide  B. ovis is known to have a rough LPS phenotype, which given the critical role of O-antigen in pathogenicity of B. abortus, B. suis and B. melitensis, likely contributes to its reduced pathogenicity for laboratory animals compared to other Brucella spp. [8], [54], [55]. As mentioned above, the wboA gene is missing from B. ovis, as well as a second, genetically linked glycosyltransferase. Pseudogenes with a possible function in LPS biosynthesis include a glycosyltransferase (BOV_A0475), an LpxA family acetyltransferase (BOV_A0367) and a putative undecaprenylphosphate alpha-N-acetylglucosamine transferase (BOV_A0371) of which the latter may also be involved in murein biosynthesis. While it is known that B. ovis LPS has a higher affinity for antimicrobial peptides than that of B. abortus, it is unknown whether differences in LPS structure compared to smooth Brucella species affect the interaction of B. ovis LPS with toll-like receptors of the innate immune system [56], [57].  Type IV secretion system (T4SS)  The T4SS, encoded by virB1-virB12, is an essential virulence factor in B. abortus, B. suis, and B. melitensis  [48], [58]–[60]. The genes virB1-VirB12 are intact in the B. ovis genome, suggesting that this system is functional. Further, the gene encoding its transcriptional activator VjbR (BOVA_0110;  [61]) is conserved. These findings are consistent with the detection of VirB5 and VirB8 expression in B. ovis  [62]. Two co-regulated genes identified as encoding T4SS substrates, vceA (BOV_1577) and vceC (BOV_1003) are present in B. ovis, however it is currently unknown whether there may be additional T4SS effectors in other Brucella spp. that are absent from B. ovis  [63]. A recent report showing that B. ovis strain PA is able to replicate in macrophages and HeLa cells at a rate similar to that of B. abortus suggests that its T4SS is functional [64].  Autotransporter proteins  Four predicted autotransporters have been identified in the sequenced Brucella genomes. Each of the sequenced Brucella genomes is predicted to encode a different combination of autotransporters [21], suggesting that none of these four proteins is essential for virulence, but that different combinations of autotransporters may contribute to observed differences in tissue tropism and host preference. The B. ovis genome is predicted to encode three functional autotransporters, corresponding to B. suis BR0072, BRA0173 and BRA1148, (BOV_0071, BOV_A0152 and BOV_A1053) while the fourth gene, BOV_1937, corresponding to BR2013, is degenerate. These proteins show a range in similarity (at the amino acid level) to their B. suis counterparts, from 99% between BRA1148 and BOV_A1053, to 86% similarity between BOV_A0152 and BRA0173. BR2013, designated omaA, is a pseudogene in both B. abortus and B. melitensis, and was noted to have a polymorphism with unknown functional effects in the genome of vaccine strain B. abortus 19 [65]. Since the product of this gene has been shown to contribute to persistence of B. suis in mice [66], it is possible that lack of a functional OmaA autotransporter in B. ovis may contribute to its limited tissue tropism and host range. However, the finding that all four autotransporter genes are predicted to be pseudogenes in B. melitensis, shows that they are not absolutely required for infectivity and transmission.  Immunomodulatory functions  In addition to the T4SS, several genes implicated in modulation of the immune response by Brucella spp., are well-conserved in B. ovis ATCC25840. These include btp1, encoding the TIR domain protein, an inhibitor of TLR2 signaling, the B cell mitogen encoded by prpA, and cyclic β-glucan synthase [67]–[70].  Outer membrane proteins  The two component regulator BvrR/BvrS, which has been shown to be a master regulator of many virulence-associated functions [71], [72], appears intact in B. ovis. However, a putative envZ osmosensor (BOV_A0412) is a pseudogene. Two genes shown to encode outer membrane proteins in other Brucella species omp2a (BOV_0632  [73]) and omp31 (BOV_1565; [74]), contain point mutations in B. ovis. For Omp31, the point mutation is predicted to lead to a truncation in the protein. It was found previously that the outer membrane of B. ovis is more susceptible to cationic peptides than a rough B. abortus mutant [56], suggesting that together with the defects in LPS biosynthesis discussed above, these defects in outer membrane components may further compromise the cell envelope stability of B. ovis making it less able to survive environmental stresses.  Perspective  The unique biology of Brucella ovis compared to the human pathogenic species appears to be in part the result of genome degradation. Worldwide, the majority of human brucellosis cases occur via ingestion of contaminated dairy products. B. ovis is not known to cause human infection, despite worldwide consumption of unpasteurized sheep's milk, where B. ovis has been detected [38]. Oral transmission, although feasible in experimental conditions, does not appear to be one of the main routes of infection for B. ovis, whereas passive venereal transmission via the ewe is the most important one [75]. This suggests that this species has lost the ability to infect via the oral route. One genomic change that may contribute to this loss of oral infectivity is the loss of an important virulence factor, urease, that is required for survival of stomach acidity by Brucella spp [36], [37]. Urease has also been shown to contribute to the establishment of Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae infection in pigs through the respiratory tract [76]. If this mechanism is also operative in Brucella spp., then it is possible that B. ovis is also deficient in establishing infections not only by the digestive route but also via aerosol inhalation, which are the two main routes of infection by human pathogenic Brucella spp. Additional genes that seem to be non-functional in B. ovis could also contribute to reduce the number of transmission routes compared to other Brucella species. A characteristic of B. ovis is its tropism for the ovine male genital tract, which presents as epididymo-orchitis [8]. Since other Brucella species, especially B. melitensis are known to cause epididymo-orchitis in human patients [77], the predilection of B. ovis to cause epididymo-orchitis in rams likely represents a loss of functions required to target to other tissues. However, due to the large number of genes in the B. ovis genome with unknown function, a gain of functions that allow for increased colonization of the male genital tract cannot be ruled out based on the genome sequence.

PMC2677664,Abstract,Abstract,NC_007618,1,0,0,,,"  Brucella ovis is a veterinary pathogen associated with epididymitis in sheep. Despite its genetic similarity to the zoonotic pathogens B. abortus, B. melitensis and B. suis, B. ovis does not cause zoonotic disease. Genomic analysis of the type strain ATCC25840 revealed a high percentage of pseudogenes and increased numbers of transposable elements compared to the zoonotic Brucella species, suggesting that genome degradation has occurred concomitant with narrowing of the host range of B. ovis. The absence of genomic island 2, encoding functions required for lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis, as well as inactivation of genes encoding urease, nutrient uptake and utilization, and outer membrane proteins may be factors contributing to the avirulence of B. ovis for humans. A 26.5 kb region of B. ovis ATCC25840 Chromosome II was absent from all the sequenced human pathogenic Brucella genomes, but was present in all of 17 B. ovis isolates tested and in three B. ceti isolates, suggesting that this DNA region may be of use for differentiating B. ovis from other Brucella spp. This is the first genomic analysis of a non-zoonotic Brucella species. The results suggest that inactivation of genes involved in nutrient acquisition and utilization, cell envelope structure and urease may have played a role in narrowing of the tissue tropism and host range of B. ovis.

PMC2677664,Introduction,Introduction,NC_007618,0,1,0,,,"  Introduction  Although previous studies have supported the notion of Brucella as a monospecies genus with different biotypes [1], it is still largely accepted that the genus Brucella is divided into six species, named according to their preferential hosts. Each one of the species is host-adapted, but not host-restricted [2]–[4]. Four of the six Brucella species, namely B. melitensis, B. abortus, B. suis, and B. canis, are capable of causing human disease. B. melitensis and B. suis are the most pathogenic, whereas B. abortus is considered of moderate pathogenicity, and B. canis is considered of low pathogenicity for humans. There are no reports of human infections with B. ovis or B. neotomae  [3]. In addition to the six classical Brucella species, Brucella has also been isolated from marine mammals, and two species, B. pinnipedialis and B. ceti have been proposed [5]. Brucella isolates from marine mammals can cause human infections, with one reported case of infection due to laboratory exposure [6], and two reported cases of natural infections resulting in neurological disease [7].  Brucella ovis was initially recognized in the beginning of the 1950's in New Zealand and Australia as a bacterial agent associated with epididymitis and abortion in sheep [8]. Since then this organism has been isolated in several countries [9], and is considered one of the most important causes of ovine infertility, with a significant economic impact on the sheep industry [10]. B. ovis has a worldwide distribution in areas where sheep are economically significant, with the exception of the Great Britain [9]. The prevalence in herds ranges from 9.1 to 46.7% [11], and the seroprevalence within positive herds varies between 2.1 to 67% [11]–[14].  B. ovis is stably rough, and it is one of the two classical Brucella species that do not have zoonotic potential. In sheep, the organism causes either clinical or sub-clinical chronic infections characterized by epididymitis, orchitis, male infertility, and occasionally abortion in pregnant ewes [15]. Sexually mature rams are more susceptible than young males [16]. However, B. ovis infection may affect males as young as 4 months old [9]. Natural transmission apparently occurs through mucosal membranes, and venereal transmission is significant when a female previously mated with an infected male copulates with a second susceptible male during the same period of estrus [17]. Upon invasion through mucosal membranes, B. ovis initially resides in local lymph nodes, which is followed by bacteremia and finally colonization of the genital tract around 30 days post infection [18]. The factors defining the genital tropism of this organism remain unknown.  Sequencing of B. melitensis, and B. suis genomes demonstrated a high level of similarity between the two genomes, with over 90% of the genes having more than 98–100% nucleotide identity [19]. Furthermore, comparison between these two species resulted in the identification of only 32 and 43 genes that were unique to B. melitensis and B. suis, respectively. This level of variability is remarkably low even when compared to variations between serotypes within the same bacterial species such as in serotypes Typhi and Typhimurium of Samonella enterica  [20]. More recently, the complete genome sequence of B. abortus (strains 9–941 and 2308) became available confirming the striking similarity both among different species of Brucella and within the species B. abortus  [21], [22]. Comparisons between these three Brucella species revealed more than 94% identity at the nucleotide level. In addition, comparisons between the genomes of the two B. abortus strains that have been sequenced (9–941 and 2308) resulted in identification of only a small number of strain-specific deletions and polymorphisms [21]. The genetic similarity among Brucella species has been confirmed by whole genome hybridizations [23]. Together these studies support the original hybridization studies performed more than 20 years ago suggesting that Brucella is a monospecific genus from the genetic point of view [1]. Considering the high level of identity among Brucella species pathogenic to humans, the comparison of those species with a Brucella lacking the potential to cause human infections may bring new insights into host specificity and pathogenesis. In this study we present the genome analysis of the rough non-human-pathogen Brucella ovis and compare its genome with those of the zoonotic Brucella spp. Our analysis focused on two sets of genomic features (i) deletions and gene degradation that could potentially result in loss of virulence factors important for infection of hosts other than sheep, and (ii) B. ovis-specific genes that could contribute to genital tract tropism or cause a reduction in virulence for non-ovine hosts.

PMC2677664,Materials and Methods,Materials and Methods,NC_007618,1,0,0,,,"  Materials and Methods  Genome sequencing and annotation  The complete genome sequence of Brucella ovis strain ATCC25840 was determined using the whole-genome shotgun method as previously described [78]. Physical and sequencing gaps were closed using a combination of primer walking, generation and sequencing of transposon-tagged libraries of large-insert clones, and multiplex PCR [79]. Identification of putative protein-encoding genes and annotation of the genome were performed as previously described [24]. An initial set of genes predicted to encode proteins was identified with GLIMMER [80]. Genes consisting of fewer than 30 codons and those containing overlaps were eliminated. Frame shifts and point mutations were corrected or designated ‘authentic.’ Functional assignment, identification of membrane-spanning domains, and determination of paralogous gene families were performed as previously described [24]. Sequence alignments and phylogenetic trees were generated using the methods described previously [24].  Trinucleotide composition  Distribution of all 64 trinucleotides (3-mers) was determined, and the 3-mer distribution in 1,000-bp windows that overlapped by half their length (500 bp) across the genome was computed. For each window, we computed the χ2 statistic on the difference between its 3-mer content and that of the whole chromosome. A large value for indicates the 3-mer composition in this window is different from the rest of the chromosome (minimum of two standard deviations). Probability values for this analysis are based on assumptions that the DNA composition is relatively uniform throughout the genome, and that 3-mer composition is independent. Because these assumptions may be incorrect, we prefer to interpret high χ2 values as indicators of regions on the chromosome that appear unusual and demand further scrutiny.  Comparative genomics  The B. ovis ATCC25840 genome was compared to the genomes of B. suis 1330, B. abortus 2308, B. abortus 9-941, and B. melitensis 16M (PATRIC), at the nucleotide level by suffix tree analysis using MUMmer [81], and the predicted B. ovis CDSs were compared with the gene sets from the other sequenced Brucella genomes by BLAST and by HMM paralogous family searches, as previously described [82].  Analysis of the B. ovis-specific island  Genomic DNA from B. ovis strains and other Brucella species (B. melitensis, B. suis, B. abortus, B. canis, B. neotomae, and B. pinnipedialis) were subjected to PCR amplification of 12 target sequences within the B. ovis-specific island. PCR reactions were performed using 13 µL of a commercial PCR mix (PCR Supermix, Invitrogen, USA), 0.75 µL of a 25 µM solution of each primer (Supplementary Table S1), and 1 µL of DNA (100 to 500 ng per reaction). Cycling parameters were denaturation at 95°C for 5 minutes; 35 cycles of denaturation (95°C for 1 min seconds), annealing (55°C for 1 min), and extension (72°C for 1 min); and a final extension at 72°C for 5 min. PCR products were resolved by agarose gel electrophoresis.

PMC2677664,Results and Discussion,Results and Discussion,NC_007618,1,1,0,,,"  Results and Discussion  General features of the B. ovis genome  The B. ovis type strain ATCC25840 (also known as 63/290 or NCTC10512) used for sequencing was isolated from a sheep in Australia in 1960 [8]. The genome of this strain consists of two circular chromosomes of 2,111,370 bp (Chromosome I; NCBI Accession Number NC_009505) and 1,164,220 bp (Chromosome II; NCBI Accession Number NC_009504), which are predicted to encode a total of 2890 proteins, 1928 on ChrI and 962 on ChrII (Table 1). Features of the B. ovis genome are summarized in Table 1. Comparison with the sequenced genomes of B. suis (GenBank Accession numbers NC_004310 and NC_004311) [24], B. abortus (GenBank Accession numbers NC_007618 and NC_007624) [21], [22] and B. melitensis 16M (GenBank Accession numbers NC_003317 and NC_003318) [19] shows a large degree of conservation, particularly in the % G+C content and size of the chromosomes. This comparison also revealed several species-specific differences, including regions missing from B. ovis relative to the other sequenced Brucella genomes and genes unique to B. ovis. These differences are listed in Table 1 and Figures 1–2, and are discussed below.  10.1371/journal.pone.0005519.g001  Figure 1  Whole genome alignment of sequenced Brucella strains.  The five genomes were compared to each other by using COG, BLAST and HMM analyses. Each genome is colored with a gradient that ranges from yellow (nucleotide 1) to blue (end). Differences in color between a reference sequence (the bottom colored line in each set) and the other genomes indicate conserved protein-coding regions that have been rearranged. Uncolored segments denote coding regions in which no conserved genes were detected. The curves on top of each panel represent the nucleotide composition (Χ2 analysis) (see   Materials and Methods  ) of the reference strain of the panel, and peaks indicate regions of atypical composition.  10.1371/journal.pone.0005519.g002  Figure 2  Map of the B. ovis-specific island on Chromosome II, which resembles a composite transposon.

Comparative best-match blastp searches identified 2282 annotated proteins in B. ovis that are shared with B. suis, B. melitensis and B. abortus, 79% of the annotated proteome. Nonetheless, this analysis suggested that the B. ovis genome lacks 675, 610 and 539 protein coding genes annotated in B. suis, B. melitensis and B. abortus 2308, respectively (Table S3). To determine whether these genes are truly absent from the B. ovis genome they were compared to the B. ovis chromosomal sequences using blastn searches. Interestingly, good matches were found for 64, 125 and 18 genes thought to be lacking in B. ovis in the genomes of B. suis, B. melitensis and B. abortus 2308, respectively (Table S3). There are several possible reasons for these genes not being highlighted as shared using comparative best-match blastp searches, e.g., they may be pseudogenes in B. ovis and therefore, not part of the predicted proteome, they may be the products of duplications where only one duplication product is matched in best match searches or differences in gene annotation between the strains resulted in these sequences not being annotated as a protein coding gene in B. ovis. In total only 33 annotated protein coding genes in B. ovis are unique to this species.  Genomic rearrangements  Gradient figures were used to compare the chromosomes of B. ovis with those of the other sequenced Brucella genomes. No large inversions or rearrangements were observed in the B. ovis genome compared to the sequenced genomes of B. suis or B. melitensis (Figure 1).  Genomic deletions  Chromosome I  Four deletions of 4 kb or larger were identified in the B. ovis genome, compared to its closest relative, B. suis. Chromosome I lacks a 15 kb region that encompasses B. suis BR0966-BR0987. Interestingly, in B. suis, this region is inserted into the sequence of tRNAgly and is adjacent to a phage integrase-like gene, features suggestive of horizontal gene transfer. This region contains the wboA glycosyl transferase gene, shown to be essential for lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis [25], and a second glycosyl transferase, as well as several hypothetical proteins. The lack of the two glycosyl transferases likely contributes to the rough LPS phenotype of B. ovis. These findings were in agreement with previous reports by Vizcaino et al and Rajashekara et al [23], [26] showing the absence of these genes from B. ovis.  A second deletion on Chromosome I of 7745 bp encompasses BR1078-BR1083. This island in B. suis contains three hypothetical genes and two site specific recombinases and is flanked by two tRNA-Leu genes, of which one remains in B. ovis. A smaller deletion of 3954 bp on Chromosome I has led to loss of two genes (BR1852-BR1853) encoding a transcriptional regulator and a protein predicted to be a branched chain amino acid permease. This deletion is also associated with transposable elements, as these two genes in B. suis are flanked by copies of IS2020  [27], one of which remains in B. ovis.  Chromosome II  The 44.5 kb island in B. suis (BRA1074-BRA1113; [28]), containing four predicted ABC transport systems and three transcriptional regulators, is absent from the B. ovis genome. The presence of two copies of IS1239 flanking two pseudogenes in B. ovis suggests that this is the result of a loss of this region by recombination.  The 18.3 kb IncP island on B. suis Chromosome II containing BRA0362-BRA0379, previously reported to be present in B. suis biovars 1–4, B. canis, B. neotomae, and marine mammal isolates but missing in B. melitensis  [24], [28], is also absent from the B. ovis genome, as reported by Lavigne and colleagues [28].  Unique genomic regions  Chromosome II, contains an island of 26.5 kb (BOV_A0482-BOV_A0515) with structure suggestive of a composite transposon (Fig. 2). This island likely overlaps the B. ovis-specific 21-kb SpeI fragment of the small chromosome identified previously by genome mapping [29]. Proteins encoded on the island include transposases, an ABC transporter, a putative hemagglutinin, and several hypothetical proteins. This region is present in 17/17 B. ovis strains tested, suggesting a high level of conservation within the species (Supplementary Table S2). Interestingly, the predicted product of BOV_A0497 exhibits similarity to antitoxins of toxin-antitoxin maintenance systems [30], suggesting a possible selective pressure for maintenance of this genetic island in B. ovis. Genome sequence data and analysis of the island by PCR showed that this region is absent from the genomes of B. suis, B. abortus, B. melitensis, B. canis and B. neotomae (Table 2), suggesting initially that it may be specific to B. ovis. However, we detected this island in three marine isolates of Brucella from captive bottlenose dolphins [31], [32]. The protein coding genes within this unique region constitute the majority of the unique protein coding genes in B. ovis (Supplementary Table S3).  10.1371/journal.pone.0005519.t002  Table 2  Detection of the B. ovis genomic island in Brucella species  Species  ORF  Brucella ovis  B. melitensis  B. abortus  B. suis  B. canis  B. neotomae  B. ceti (Muu)  B. ceti (Cudo)  B. ceti (Nor)  NTC1  A0492  +  −  −  −  −  −  +  +  +  −  A0495  +  −  −  −  −  −  +  +  +  −  A0496  +  −  −  −  −  −  +  +  +  −  A0497  +  −  −  −  −  −  +  +  +  −  A0500  +  −  −  −  −  −  +  +  +  −  A0502  +  −  −  −  −  −  +  +  +  −  A0503  +  −  −  −  −  −  +  +  +  −  A0504  +  −  −  −  −  −  +  +  +  −  A0505  +  −  −  −  −  −  +  +  +  −  A0506  +  −  −  −  −  −  +  +  +  −  A0511  +  −  −  −  −  −  +  +  +  −  A0512  +  −  −  −  −  −  +  +  +  −  BR06152  +  +  +  +  +  +  +  +  +  −  1  NTC, no template control  2  Positive control for amplification reaction  Transposable elements  The genome of B. ovis contains 38 complete copies of IS711, confirming previous estimates obtained by hybridization [33]. 25 of the copies are located in Chromosome I, and 13 in Chromosome II. Interestingly, several of these copies appear to be expanded clonally, suggesting that they could be active in B. ovis. In 17 cases, IS711 is inserted in copies of a repeated sequence of the BruRS family [34]. Five of the IS711 copies appear to disrupt genes, which could be a contributing factor to the general process of genome degradation observed in B. ovis. A case of special interest is the B. ovis-specific island (see above), where a 25 kb region between two copies of IS711 in B. ovis is absent in all the other sequenced species, suggestive of either deletion by recombination between the two copies in the other Brucella species, or of acquisition of the region with duplication of IS711.  Pseudogenes  It has been proposed that the unique complement of pseudogenes in each of the Brucella species may contribute to their differing degrees of infectivity and host preference [21], [22]. Interestingly B. abortus, which is less virulent for humans than B. suis and B. melitensis, has a greater number of pseudogenes (316) than B. suis 1330 (62) or B. melitensis 16M (163) (Table 1). Similar to B. abortus, the B. ovis genome contains a large number of pseudogenes with 244 identified. The small chromosome contains more pseudogenes (125; 11.3%) than the large chromosome (119; 5.7%) (Table 1). Of the 244 B. ovis pseudogenes, 40 are hypothetical or conserved hypothetical genes, 62 have predicted transport functions, 23 are defective transposases, and 14 are predicted to have regulatory functions. The finding that some pseudogenes in the B. melitensis flagellar region encode full-length proteins raises the question of whether some pseudogenes in B. ovis may also be functional [35].  Metabolism  Urease  Based on biotyping, B. ovis is urease-negative. However it contains the two urease clusters described in all the other sequenced Brucella genomes. Urease has been reported to be important for the ability of B. abortus  [36] and B. suis  [37] to survive passage through the stomach in the mouse model of infection. The importance of urease for oral infection is consistent with a lack of human infections observed with B. ovis, despite identification of this organism in the milk of infected ewes [38]. The ure1 cluster is the only one showing urease activity at least in B. abortus, B. melitensis, and B. suis  [36], [37], while the ure2 does not have any demonstrable urease activity. The ure1 cluster of B. ovis contains several point mutations that are predicted to result in conserved changes shared by at least one other urease positive species. However, UreC1 contains a 30 bp deletion that would cause a loss of 10 amino acids in UreC1. Although all the residues described to be important for enzymatic activity of UreC1 are conserved [39], this deletion must render the urease inactive. Moreover, complementation with the ureC1 gene from B. melitensis (Sangari, unpublished results) results in urease activity. Regarding the ure2 cluster, ureF2 (BOV_1316) and ureT (BOV_1319) are pseudogenes, while the remaining genes are conserved, suggesting that this cluster could encode an unknown activity.  Sugar metabolism  B. ovis is defective in oxidative metabolism of arabinose, galactose, ribose, xylose, glucose and erythritol [40]. Analysis of the genome sequence reveals a possible basis for these metabolic defects in B. ovis relative to the human pathogenic Brucella species. Several putative sugar transporters predicted to be functional in other Brucella species appear to be inactivated by frameshifts, point mutations or gene degradation in B. ovis. Further, pckA encoding phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (BOV_2009) is inactivated by frameshift, which would affect the gluconeogenesis pathway and the ability of B. ovis to utilize pyruvate, amino acids, or glycerol as carbon sources.  Erythritol  Erythritol is the preferred carbon source of B. abortus  [41], [42]. Erythritol is metabolized in Brucella by the enzymes encoded in the eryABCD operon[43] Moreover, it has been recently described that the carbohydrate transport system located upstream of the ery operon constitutes the erythritol transport system in Rhizobium leguminosarum bv. Viciae  [44], and that the operon immediately downstream also forms part of the erythritol catabolic pathway. Microarray experiments have revealed that these three operons are regulated by erythritol in B. abortus, reinforcing that the three clusters participate in erythritol catabolism (Sangari et al, unpublished). B. ovis does not oxidize erythritol, and it is not inhibited by its presence in the growth media. This is reflected in the genome by the presence of a stop codon in eryA (BOV_A0811) and a frameshift in eryD (BOV_A0814) that render them pseudogenes. In addition two genes of the putative ABC erythritol transport system, eryF and eryG (BOV_A805 and BOV_A806)) carry mutations that render them pseudogenes (a 2 bp deletion resulting in an premature stop codon). The mutation in eryD could have an effect in the over expression of all genes of the ery system. On the contrary, mutations in the transport genes and in eryA block the entry of erythritol in the cell and its phosphorylation, avoiding the accumulation of toxic intermediates and the depletion of ATP observed in the vaccine strain S19 [45]. The accumulation of mutations in these two clusters suggest that they may no longer be needed by B. ovis. The third cluster is intact, and the enzymes use substrates that are central (or core) carbohydrate metabolites such as dihydroxyacetone phosphate, glyceraldehydes-3-phosphate, and other three carbon compounds that can be produced after decarboxylation of erythritol and its derivatives.  While it has been hypothesized that erythritol may serve as a carbon source during growth of B. abortus, B. suis, and B. melitensis in the placenta of their natural hosts, an analysis of deletion mutants in these models has not been reported. However, the lower incidence of abortion in sheep flocks infected with B. ovis compared to B. melitensis correlates with the inability of B. ovis to use erythritol as a carbon source. Mutants in eryB and eryC have been described to have a limited ability to grow in macrophages [46]. This limitation may well contribute to the limited virulence of B. ovis.  Glucose and Galactose  Unlike B. melitensis, B. abortus and B. suis, B. ovis is unable to grow on glucose or galactose as a primary carbon source [40]. Analysis of genes involved in uptake and utilization of these carbon sources reveals that B. ovis gluP (BOV_A0172), encoding a glucose/galactose transporter [47] is a pseudogene. B. abortus gluP mutants have a reduced ability to persist in the spleens of mice [48], suggesting that the ability to utilize these carbon sources may be important for systemic persistence of the human pathogenic Brucella species. However B. suis also lacks GluP and is able to oxidize glucose and galactose, suggesting that additional functions are lacking in B. ovis that contribute to utilization of these carbon sources. Several predicted sugar ABC transporters (BOV_1299-BOV1301, BOV_A0278-BOV_A0282, BOV_A0645-BOV_A0648 and BOV_A1083-BOV_A1086) of unknown specificity contain pseudogenes, which may potentially reduce the ability of B. ovis to take up glucose and galactose.  Ribose  Two components, a permease and an ATP binding protein of a putative ribose ABC transport system (BOV_A0936-BOV_A0937) are pseudogenes in B. ovis, suggesting that the inability of B. ovis to utilize ribose as a sole carbon source may be the result of a reduced capacity to take up ribose from the growth medium. Similarly, a periplasmic binding protein and an ATP binding protein of a predicted ABC transporter for xylose (BOV_A1055-BOVA1056) contain frameshifts, which may underlie the inability of B. ovis to utilize xylose [40].  Oxidase phenotype  B. ovis is the only Brucella species with a negative oxidase phenotype. Oxidase phenotype depends on the activity of cytochrome C oxidase which in B. suis is encoded by at least 7 genes, four of them organized in one operon, BR0363-BR0360 (ccoNOQP), together with BR0467 (coxB), encoding cytochrome c oxidase, subunit II, BR0468 (coxA) encoding cytochrome c oxidase, subunit I and BR0472 (coxC) encoding cytochrome c oxidase, subunit III. In B. ovis, the operon ccoNOQP (BOV_0376-BOV_0379), encoding the cb type cytochrome c oxidase is well conserved, except the gene ccoO (BOV_0378), which contains a frameshift generated by deletion of an A near its 5′ end, is a pseudogene. The B. ovis coxB gene (BOV_0473) contains a frameshift that very probably inactivates the gene, while coxA (BOV_0474) differs only in two residues with the B. suis product. The last 6 amino acids of coxC (BOV_0478) are lost as result of a short deletion (56 bp) that fuses this product with the next, apparently unrelated Orf. A short repeated sequence (GGGGCGGC) at both ends of the deletion seems to be responsible for this rearrangement. These genomic differences may be responsible for the oxidase negative phenotype of B. ovis.  Nitrogen metabolism  Several genes encoded in the B. suis genome with inferred functions in nitrogen metabolism are not predicted to be functional in the B. ovis genome. The genes norB (BOV_A0225), encoding the large subunit of nitric oxide reductase, and nosX (BOV_A0256), a gene of unknown function in the operon encoding nitric oxide synthase, are pseudogenes in B. ovis. The third gene, narK (BOV_A0276), encoding a nitrite extrusion protein, is degenerate, as was found in the B. melitensis and B. abortus 2308 genomes [21]. Nitric oxide reductase is required for survival and persistence of B. suis in mice [49], suggesting that lack of this activity in B. ovis may contribute to its restricted tissue tropism and host range.  A locus that contributes to growth of E. coli on aspartate as a nitrogen source, xanthine dehydrogenase (BOV_0365-BOV_0367;  [50]) contains a pseudogene in B. ovis, suggesting a further defect in nitrogen metabolism. Further, this locus could function in salvage pathways for purine nucleotides, which could contribute to nitrogen metabolism. A correlation between a defective purine nucleotide salvage pathway and reduced ability of B. ovis to survive intracellularly would be consistent with the importance of purine biosynthetic pathways for full virulence of B. abortus and B. melitensis  [51], [52]. Further, a homolog of Sinorhizobium meliloti fixI (BOV_0373), encoding an cation pump involved in symbiotic nitrogen fixation [53], is inactivated by a point mutation in the B. ovis genome. As the function of the fixGHI genes in Brucella spp. has not been determined, the biological significance of this gene inactivation for B. ovis is currently unknown.  Host-pathogen interactions  Lipopolysaccharide  B. ovis is known to have a rough LPS phenotype, which given the critical role of O-antigen in pathogenicity of B. abortus, B. suis and B. melitensis, likely contributes to its reduced pathogenicity for laboratory animals compared to other Brucella spp. [8], [54], [55]. As mentioned above, the wboA gene is missing from B. ovis, as well as a second, genetically linked glycosyltransferase. Pseudogenes with a possible function in LPS biosynthesis include a glycosyltransferase (BOV_A0475), an LpxA family acetyltransferase (BOV_A0367) and a putative undecaprenylphosphate alpha-N-acetylglucosamine transferase (BOV_A0371) of which the latter may also be involved in murein biosynthesis. While it is known that B. ovis LPS has a higher affinity for antimicrobial peptides than that of B. abortus, it is unknown whether differences in LPS structure compared to smooth Brucella species affect the interaction of B. ovis LPS with toll-like receptors of the innate immune system [56], [57].  Type IV secretion system (T4SS)  The T4SS, encoded by virB1-virB12, is an essential virulence factor in B. abortus, B. suis, and B. melitensis  [48], [58]–[60]. The genes virB1-VirB12 are intact in the B. ovis genome, suggesting that this system is functional. Further, the gene encoding its transcriptional activator VjbR (BOVA_0110;  [61]) is conserved. These findings are consistent with the detection of VirB5 and VirB8 expression in B. ovis  [62]. Two co-regulated genes identified as encoding T4SS substrates, vceA (BOV_1577) and vceC (BOV_1003) are present in B. ovis, however it is currently unknown whether there may be additional T4SS effectors in other Brucella spp. that are absent from B. ovis  [63]. A recent report showing that B. ovis strain PA is able to replicate in macrophages and HeLa cells at a rate similar to that of B. abortus suggests that its T4SS is functional [64].  Autotransporter proteins  Four predicted autotransporters have been identified in the sequenced Brucella genomes. Each of the sequenced Brucella genomes is predicted to encode a different combination of autotransporters [21], suggesting that none of these four proteins is essential for virulence, but that different combinations of autotransporters may contribute to observed differences in tissue tropism and host preference. The B. ovis genome is predicted to encode three functional autotransporters, corresponding to B. suis BR0072, BRA0173 and BRA1148, (BOV_0071, BOV_A0152 and BOV_A1053) while the fourth gene, BOV_1937, corresponding to BR2013, is degenerate. These proteins show a range in similarity (at the amino acid level) to their B. suis counterparts, from 99% between BRA1148 and BOV_A1053, to 86% similarity between BOV_A0152 and BRA0173. BR2013, designated omaA, is a pseudogene in both B. abortus and B. melitensis, and was noted to have a polymorphism with unknown functional effects in the genome of vaccine strain B. abortus 19 [65]. Since the product of this gene has been shown to contribute to persistence of B. suis in mice [66], it is possible that lack of a functional OmaA autotransporter in B. ovis may contribute to its limited tissue tropism and host range. However, the finding that all four autotransporter genes are predicted to be pseudogenes in B. melitensis, shows that they are not absolutely required for infectivity and transmission.  Immunomodulatory functions  In addition to the T4SS, several genes implicated in modulation of the immune response by Brucella spp., are well-conserved in B. ovis ATCC25840. These include btp1, encoding the TIR domain protein, an inhibitor of TLR2 signaling, the B cell mitogen encoded by prpA, and cyclic β-glucan synthase [67]–[70].  Outer membrane proteins  The two component regulator BvrR/BvrS, which has been shown to be a master regulator of many virulence-associated functions [71], [72], appears intact in B. ovis. However, a putative envZ osmosensor (BOV_A0412) is a pseudogene. Two genes shown to encode outer membrane proteins in other Brucella species omp2a (BOV_0632  [73]) and omp31 (BOV_1565; [74]), contain point mutations in B. ovis. For Omp31, the point mutation is predicted to lead to a truncation in the protein. It was found previously that the outer membrane of B. ovis is more susceptible to cationic peptides than a rough B. abortus mutant [56], suggesting that together with the defects in LPS biosynthesis discussed above, these defects in outer membrane components may further compromise the cell envelope stability of B. ovis making it less able to survive environmental stresses.  Perspective  The unique biology of Brucella ovis compared to the human pathogenic species appears to be in part the result of genome degradation. Worldwide, the majority of human brucellosis cases occur via ingestion of contaminated dairy products. B. ovis is not known to cause human infection, despite worldwide consumption of unpasteurized sheep's milk, where B. ovis has been detected [38]. Oral transmission, although feasible in experimental conditions, does not appear to be one of the main routes of infection for B. ovis, whereas passive venereal transmission via the ewe is the most important one [75]. This suggests that this species has lost the ability to infect via the oral route. One genomic change that may contribute to this loss of oral infectivity is the loss of an important virulence factor, urease, that is required for survival of stomach acidity by Brucella spp [36], [37]. Urease has also been shown to contribute to the establishment of Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae infection in pigs through the respiratory tract [76]. If this mechanism is also operative in Brucella spp., then it is possible that B. ovis is also deficient in establishing infections not only by the digestive route but also via aerosol inhalation, which are the two main routes of infection by human pathogenic Brucella spp. Additional genes that seem to be non-functional in B. ovis could also contribute to reduce the number of transmission routes compared to other Brucella species. A characteristic of B. ovis is its tropism for the ovine male genital tract, which presents as epididymo-orchitis [8]. Since other Brucella species, especially B. melitensis are known to cause epididymo-orchitis in human patients [77], the predilection of B. ovis to cause epididymo-orchitis in rams likely represents a loss of functions required to target to other tissues. However, due to the large number of genes in the B. ovis genome with unknown function, a gain of functions that allow for increased colonization of the male genital tract cannot be ruled out based on the genome sequence.

PMC2677664,Abstract,Abstract,NC_007624,1,0,0,,,"  Brucella ovis is a veterinary pathogen associated with epididymitis in sheep. Despite its genetic similarity to the zoonotic pathogens B. abortus, B. melitensis and B. suis, B. ovis does not cause zoonotic disease. Genomic analysis of the type strain ATCC25840 revealed a high percentage of pseudogenes and increased numbers of transposable elements compared to the zoonotic Brucella species, suggesting that genome degradation has occurred concomitant with narrowing of the host range of B. ovis. The absence of genomic island 2, encoding functions required for lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis, as well as inactivation of genes encoding urease, nutrient uptake and utilization, and outer membrane proteins may be factors contributing to the avirulence of B. ovis for humans. A 26.5 kb region of B. ovis ATCC25840 Chromosome II was absent from all the sequenced human pathogenic Brucella genomes, but was present in all of 17 B. ovis isolates tested and in three B. ceti isolates, suggesting that this DNA region may be of use for differentiating B. ovis from other Brucella spp. This is the first genomic analysis of a non-zoonotic Brucella species. The results suggest that inactivation of genes involved in nutrient acquisition and utilization, cell envelope structure and urease may have played a role in narrowing of the tissue tropism and host range of B. ovis.

PMC2677664,Introduction,Introduction,NC_007624,0,1,0,,,"  Introduction  Although previous studies have supported the notion of Brucella as a monospecies genus with different biotypes [1], it is still largely accepted that the genus Brucella is divided into six species, named according to their preferential hosts. Each one of the species is host-adapted, but not host-restricted [2]–[4]. Four of the six Brucella species, namely B. melitensis, B. abortus, B. suis, and B. canis, are capable of causing human disease. B. melitensis and B. suis are the most pathogenic, whereas B. abortus is considered of moderate pathogenicity, and B. canis is considered of low pathogenicity for humans. There are no reports of human infections with B. ovis or B. neotomae  [3]. In addition to the six classical Brucella species, Brucella has also been isolated from marine mammals, and two species, B. pinnipedialis and B. ceti have been proposed [5]. Brucella isolates from marine mammals can cause human infections, with one reported case of infection due to laboratory exposure [6], and two reported cases of natural infections resulting in neurological disease [7].  Brucella ovis was initially recognized in the beginning of the 1950's in New Zealand and Australia as a bacterial agent associated with epididymitis and abortion in sheep [8]. Since then this organism has been isolated in several countries [9], and is considered one of the most important causes of ovine infertility, with a significant economic impact on the sheep industry [10]. B. ovis has a worldwide distribution in areas where sheep are economically significant, with the exception of the Great Britain [9]. The prevalence in herds ranges from 9.1 to 46.7% [11], and the seroprevalence within positive herds varies between 2.1 to 67% [11]–[14].  B. ovis is stably rough, and it is one of the two classical Brucella species that do not have zoonotic potential. In sheep, the organism causes either clinical or sub-clinical chronic infections characterized by epididymitis, orchitis, male infertility, and occasionally abortion in pregnant ewes [15]. Sexually mature rams are more susceptible than young males [16]. However, B. ovis infection may affect males as young as 4 months old [9]. Natural transmission apparently occurs through mucosal membranes, and venereal transmission is significant when a female previously mated with an infected male copulates with a second susceptible male during the same period of estrus [17]. Upon invasion through mucosal membranes, B. ovis initially resides in local lymph nodes, which is followed by bacteremia and finally colonization of the genital tract around 30 days post infection [18]. The factors defining the genital tropism of this organism remain unknown.  Sequencing of B. melitensis, and B. suis genomes demonstrated a high level of similarity between the two genomes, with over 90% of the genes having more than 98–100% nucleotide identity [19]. Furthermore, comparison between these two species resulted in the identification of only 32 and 43 genes that were unique to B. melitensis and B. suis, respectively. This level of variability is remarkably low even when compared to variations between serotypes within the same bacterial species such as in serotypes Typhi and Typhimurium of Samonella enterica  [20]. More recently, the complete genome sequence of B. abortus (strains 9–941 and 2308) became available confirming the striking similarity both among different species of Brucella and within the species B. abortus  [21], [22]. Comparisons between these three Brucella species revealed more than 94% identity at the nucleotide level. In addition, comparisons between the genomes of the two B. abortus strains that have been sequenced (9–941 and 2308) resulted in identification of only a small number of strain-specific deletions and polymorphisms [21]. The genetic similarity among Brucella species has been confirmed by whole genome hybridizations [23]. Together these studies support the original hybridization studies performed more than 20 years ago suggesting that Brucella is a monospecific genus from the genetic point of view [1]. Considering the high level of identity among Brucella species pathogenic to humans, the comparison of those species with a Brucella lacking the potential to cause human infections may bring new insights into host specificity and pathogenesis. In this study we present the genome analysis of the rough non-human-pathogen Brucella ovis and compare its genome with those of the zoonotic Brucella spp. Our analysis focused on two sets of genomic features (i) deletions and gene degradation that could potentially result in loss of virulence factors important for infection of hosts other than sheep, and (ii) B. ovis-specific genes that could contribute to genital tract tropism or cause a reduction in virulence for non-ovine hosts.

PMC2677664,Materials and Methods,Materials and Methods,NC_007624,1,0,0,,,"  Materials and Methods  Genome sequencing and annotation  The complete genome sequence of Brucella ovis strain ATCC25840 was determined using the whole-genome shotgun method as previously described [78]. Physical and sequencing gaps were closed using a combination of primer walking, generation and sequencing of transposon-tagged libraries of large-insert clones, and multiplex PCR [79]. Identification of putative protein-encoding genes and annotation of the genome were performed as previously described [24]. An initial set of genes predicted to encode proteins was identified with GLIMMER [80]. Genes consisting of fewer than 30 codons and those containing overlaps were eliminated. Frame shifts and point mutations were corrected or designated ‘authentic.’ Functional assignment, identification of membrane-spanning domains, and determination of paralogous gene families were performed as previously described [24]. Sequence alignments and phylogenetic trees were generated using the methods described previously [24].  Trinucleotide composition  Distribution of all 64 trinucleotides (3-mers) was determined, and the 3-mer distribution in 1,000-bp windows that overlapped by half their length (500 bp) across the genome was computed. For each window, we computed the χ2 statistic on the difference between its 3-mer content and that of the whole chromosome. A large value for indicates the 3-mer composition in this window is different from the rest of the chromosome (minimum of two standard deviations). Probability values for this analysis are based on assumptions that the DNA composition is relatively uniform throughout the genome, and that 3-mer composition is independent. Because these assumptions may be incorrect, we prefer to interpret high χ2 values as indicators of regions on the chromosome that appear unusual and demand further scrutiny.  Comparative genomics  The B. ovis ATCC25840 genome was compared to the genomes of B. suis 1330, B. abortus 2308, B. abortus 9-941, and B. melitensis 16M (PATRIC), at the nucleotide level by suffix tree analysis using MUMmer [81], and the predicted B. ovis CDSs were compared with the gene sets from the other sequenced Brucella genomes by BLAST and by HMM paralogous family searches, as previously described [82].  Analysis of the B. ovis-specific island  Genomic DNA from B. ovis strains and other Brucella species (B. melitensis, B. suis, B. abortus, B. canis, B. neotomae, and B. pinnipedialis) were subjected to PCR amplification of 12 target sequences within the B. ovis-specific island. PCR reactions were performed using 13 µL of a commercial PCR mix (PCR Supermix, Invitrogen, USA), 0.75 µL of a 25 µM solution of each primer (Supplementary Table S1), and 1 µL of DNA (100 to 500 ng per reaction). Cycling parameters were denaturation at 95°C for 5 minutes; 35 cycles of denaturation (95°C for 1 min seconds), annealing (55°C for 1 min), and extension (72°C for 1 min); and a final extension at 72°C for 5 min. PCR products were resolved by agarose gel electrophoresis.  GenBank accession  The genomic sequence data are available at GenBank under accession numbers NC_009505 (Chromosome I) and NC_009504 (Chromosome II).  ",FALSE,TRUE,

PMC2677664,Results and Discussion,Results and Discussion,NC_007624,1,1,0,,,"  Results and Discussion  General features of the B. ovis genome  The B. ovis type strain ATCC25840 (also known as 63/290 or NCTC10512) used for sequencing was isolated from a sheep in Australia in 1960 [8]. The genome of this strain consists of two circular chromosomes of 2,111,370 bp (Chromosome I; NCBI Accession Number NC_009505) and 1,164,220 bp (Chromosome II; NCBI Accession Number NC_009504), which are predicted to encode a total of 2890 proteins, 1928 on ChrI and 962 on ChrII (Table 1). Features of the B. ovis genome are summarized in Table 1. Comparison with the sequenced genomes of B. suis (GenBank Accession numbers NC_004310 and NC_004311) [24], B. abortus (GenBank Accession numbers NC_007618 and NC_007624) [21], [22] and B. melitensis 16M (GenBank Accession numbers NC_003317 and NC_003318) [19] shows a large degree of conservation, particularly in the % G+C content and size of the chromosomes. This comparison also revealed several species-specific differences, including regions missing from B. ovis relative to the other sequenced Brucella genomes and genes unique to B. ovis. These differences are listed in Table 1 and Figures 1–2, and are discussed below.  10.1371/journal.pone.0005519.g001  Figure 1  Whole genome alignment of sequenced Brucella strains.  The five genomes were compared to each other by using COG, BLAST and HMM analyses. Each genome is colored with a gradient that ranges from yellow (nucleotide 1) to blue (end). Differences in color between a reference sequence (the bottom colored line in each set) and the other genomes indicate conserved protein-coding regions that have been rearranged. Uncolored segments denote coding regions in which no conserved genes were detected. The curves on top of each panel represent the nucleotide composition (Χ2 analysis) (see   Materials and Methods  ) of the reference strain of the panel, and peaks indicate regions of atypical composition.  10.1371/journal.pone.0005519.g002  Figure 2  Map of the B. ovis-specific island on Chromosome II, which resembles a composite transposon.

Comparative best-match blastp searches identified 2282 annotated proteins in B. ovis that are shared with B. suis, B. melitensis and B. abortus, 79% of the annotated proteome. Nonetheless, this analysis suggested that the B. ovis genome lacks 675, 610 and 539 protein coding genes annotated in B. suis, B. melitensis and B. abortus 2308, respectively (Table S3). To determine whether these genes are truly absent from the B. ovis genome they were compared to the B. ovis chromosomal sequences using blastn searches. Interestingly, good matches were found for 64, 125 and 18 genes thought to be lacking in B. ovis in the genomes of B. suis, B. melitensis and B. abortus 2308, respectively (Table S3). There are several possible reasons for these genes not being highlighted as shared using comparative best-match blastp searches, e.g., they may be pseudogenes in B. ovis and therefore, not part of the predicted proteome, they may be the products of duplications where only one duplication product is matched in best match searches or differences in gene annotation between the strains resulted in these sequences not being annotated as a protein coding gene in B. ovis. In total only 33 annotated protein coding genes in B. ovis are unique to this species.  Genomic rearrangements  Gradient figures were used to compare the chromosomes of B. ovis with those of the other sequenced Brucella genomes. No large inversions or rearrangements were observed in the B. ovis genome compared to the sequenced genomes of B. suis or B. melitensis (Figure 1).  Genomic deletions  Chromosome I  Four deletions of 4 kb or larger were identified in the B. ovis genome, compared to its closest relative, B. suis. Chromosome I lacks a 15 kb region that encompasses B. suis BR0966-BR0987. Interestingly, in B. suis, this region is inserted into the sequence of tRNAgly and is adjacent to a phage integrase-like gene, features suggestive of horizontal gene transfer. This region contains the wboA glycosyl transferase gene, shown to be essential for lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis [25], and a second glycosyl transferase, as well as several hypothetical proteins. The lack of the two glycosyl transferases likely contributes to the rough LPS phenotype of B. ovis. These findings were in agreement with previous reports by Vizcaino et al and Rajashekara et al [23], [26] showing the absence of these genes from B. ovis.  A second deletion on Chromosome I of 7745 bp encompasses BR1078-BR1083. This island in B. suis contains three hypothetical genes and two site specific recombinases and is flanked by two tRNA-Leu genes, of which one remains in B. ovis. A smaller deletion of 3954 bp on Chromosome I has led to loss of two genes (BR1852-BR1853) encoding a transcriptional regulator and a protein predicted to be a branched chain amino acid permease. This deletion is also associated with transposable elements, as these two genes in B. suis are flanked by copies of IS2020  [27], one of which remains in B. ovis.  Chromosome II  The 44.5 kb island in B. suis (BRA1074-BRA1113; [28]), containing four predicted ABC transport systems and three transcriptional regulators, is absent from the B. ovis genome. The presence of two copies of IS1239 flanking two pseudogenes in B. ovis suggests that this is the result of a loss of this region by recombination.  The 18.3 kb IncP island on B. suis Chromosome II containing BRA0362-BRA0379, previously reported to be present in B. suis biovars 1–4, B. canis, B. neotomae, and marine mammal isolates but missing in B. melitensis  [24], [28], is also absent from the B. ovis genome, as reported by Lavigne and colleagues [28].  Unique genomic regions  Chromosome II, contains an island of 26.5 kb (BOV_A0482-BOV_A0515) with structure suggestive of a composite transposon (Fig. 2). This island likely overlaps the B. ovis-specific 21-kb SpeI fragment of the small chromosome identified previously by genome mapping [29]. Proteins encoded on the island include transposases, an ABC transporter, a putative hemagglutinin, and several hypothetical proteins. This region is present in 17/17 B. ovis strains tested, suggesting a high level of conservation within the species (Supplementary Table S2). Interestingly, the predicted product of BOV_A0497 exhibits similarity to antitoxins of toxin-antitoxin maintenance systems [30], suggesting a possible selective pressure for maintenance of this genetic island in B. ovis. Genome sequence data and analysis of the island by PCR showed that this region is absent from the genomes of B. suis, B. abortus, B. melitensis, B. canis and B. neotomae (Table 2), suggesting initially that it may be specific to B. ovis. However, we detected this island in three marine isolates of Brucella from captive bottlenose dolphins [31], [32]. The protein coding genes within this unique region constitute the majority of the unique protein coding genes in B. ovis (Supplementary Table S3).  10.1371/journal.pone.0005519.t002  Table 2  Detection of the B. ovis genomic island in Brucella species  Species  ORF  Brucella ovis  B. melitensis  B. abortus  B. suis  B. canis  B. neotomae  B. ceti (Muu)  B. ceti (Cudo)  B. ceti (Nor)  NTC1  A0492  +  −  −  −  −  −  +  +  +  −  A0495  +  −  −  −  −  −  +  +  +  −  A0496  +  −  −  −  −  −  +  +  +  −  A0497  +  −  −  −  −  −  +  +  +  −  A0500  +  −  −  −  −  −  +  +  +  −  A0502  +  −  −  −  −  −  +  +  +  −  A0503  +  −  −  −  −  −  +  +  +  −  A0504  +  −  −  −  −  −  +  +  +  −  A0505  +  −  −  −  −  −  +  +  +  −  A0506  +  −  −  −  −  −  +  +  +  −  A0511  +  −  −  −  −  −  +  +  +  −  A0512  +  −  −  −  −  −  +  +  +  −  BR06152  +  +  +  +  +  +  +  +  +  −  1  NTC, no template control  2  Positive control for amplification reaction  Transposable elements  The genome of B. ovis contains 38 complete copies of IS711, confirming previous estimates obtained by hybridization [33]. 25 of the copies are located in Chromosome I, and 13 in Chromosome II. Interestingly, several of these copies appear to be expanded clonally, suggesting that they could be active in B. ovis. In 17 cases, IS711 is inserted in copies of a repeated sequence of the BruRS family [34]. Five of the IS711 copies appear to disrupt genes, which could be a contributing factor to the general process of genome degradation observed in B. ovis. A case of special interest is the B. ovis-specific island (see above), where a 25 kb region between two copies of IS711 in B. ovis is absent in all the other sequenced species, suggestive of either deletion by recombination between the two copies in the other Brucella species, or of acquisition of the region with duplication of IS711.  Pseudogenes  It has been proposed that the unique complement of pseudogenes in each of the Brucella species may contribute to their differing degrees of infectivity and host preference [21], [22]. Interestingly B. abortus, which is less virulent for humans than B. suis and B. melitensis, has a greater number of pseudogenes (316) than B. suis 1330 (62) or B. melitensis 16M (163) (Table 1). Similar to B. abortus, the B. ovis genome contains a large number of pseudogenes with 244 identified. The small chromosome contains more pseudogenes (125; 11.3%) than the large chromosome (119; 5.7%) (Table 1). Of the 244 B. ovis pseudogenes, 40 are hypothetical or conserved hypothetical genes, 62 have predicted transport functions, 23 are defective transposases, and 14 are predicted to have regulatory functions. The finding that some pseudogenes in the B. melitensis flagellar region encode full-length proteins raises the question of whether some pseudogenes in B. ovis may also be functional [35].  Metabolism  Urease  Based on biotyping, B. ovis is urease-negative. However it contains the two urease clusters described in all the other sequenced Brucella genomes. Urease has been reported to be important for the ability of B. abortus  [36] and B. suis  [37] to survive passage through the stomach in the mouse model of infection. The importance of urease for oral infection is consistent with a lack of human infections observed with B. ovis, despite identification of this organism in the milk of infected ewes [38]. The ure1 cluster is the only one showing urease activity at least in B. abortus, B. melitensis, and B. suis  [36], [37], while the ure2 does not have any demonstrable urease activity. The ure1 cluster of B. ovis contains several point mutations that are predicted to result in conserved changes shared by at least one other urease positive species. However, UreC1 contains a 30 bp deletion that would cause a loss of 10 amino acids in UreC1. Although all the residues described to be important for enzymatic activity of UreC1 are conserved [39], this deletion must render the urease inactive. Moreover, complementation with the ureC1 gene from B. melitensis (Sangari, unpublished results) results in urease activity. Regarding the ure2 cluster, ureF2 (BOV_1316) and ureT (BOV_1319) are pseudogenes, while the remaining genes are conserved, suggesting that this cluster could encode an unknown activity.  Sugar metabolism  B. ovis is defective in oxidative metabolism of arabinose, galactose, ribose, xylose, glucose and erythritol [40]. Analysis of the genome sequence reveals a possible basis for these metabolic defects in B. ovis relative to the human pathogenic Brucella species. Several putative sugar transporters predicted to be functional in other Brucella species appear to be inactivated by frameshifts, point mutations or gene degradation in B. ovis. Further, pckA encoding phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (BOV_2009) is inactivated by frameshift, which would affect the gluconeogenesis pathway and the ability of B. ovis to utilize pyruvate, amino acids, or glycerol as carbon sources.  Erythritol  Erythritol is the preferred carbon source of B. abortus  [41], [42]. Erythritol is metabolized in Brucella by the enzymes encoded in the eryABCD operon[43] Moreover, it has been recently described that the carbohydrate transport system located upstream of the ery operon constitutes the erythritol transport system in Rhizobium leguminosarum bv. Viciae  [44], and that the operon immediately downstream also forms part of the erythritol catabolic pathway. Microarray experiments have revealed that these three operons are regulated by erythritol in B. abortus, reinforcing that the three clusters participate in erythritol catabolism (Sangari et al, unpublished). B. ovis does not oxidize erythritol, and it is not inhibited by its presence in the growth media. This is reflected in the genome by the presence of a stop codon in eryA (BOV_A0811) and a frameshift in eryD (BOV_A0814) that render them pseudogenes. In addition two genes of the putative ABC erythritol transport system, eryF and eryG (BOV_A805 and BOV_A806)) carry mutations that render them pseudogenes (a 2 bp deletion resulting in an premature stop codon). The mutation in eryD could have an effect in the over expression of all genes of the ery system. On the contrary, mutations in the transport genes and in eryA block the entry of erythritol in the cell and its phosphorylation, avoiding the accumulation of toxic intermediates and the depletion of ATP observed in the vaccine strain S19 [45]. The accumulation of mutations in these two clusters suggest that they may no longer be needed by B. ovis. The third cluster is intact, and the enzymes use substrates that are central (or core) carbohydrate metabolites such as dihydroxyacetone phosphate, glyceraldehydes-3-phosphate, and other three carbon compounds that can be produced after decarboxylation of erythritol and its derivatives.  While it has been hypothesized that erythritol may serve as a carbon source during growth of B. abortus, B. suis, and B. melitensis in the placenta of their natural hosts, an analysis of deletion mutants in these models has not been reported. However, the lower incidence of abortion in sheep flocks infected with B. ovis compared to B. melitensis correlates with the inability of B. ovis to use erythritol as a carbon source. Mutants in eryB and eryC have been described to have a limited ability to grow in macrophages [46]. This limitation may well contribute to the limited virulence of B. ovis.  Glucose and Galactose  Unlike B. melitensis, B. abortus and B. suis, B. ovis is unable to grow on glucose or galactose as a primary carbon source [40]. Analysis of genes involved in uptake and utilization of these carbon sources reveals that B. ovis gluP (BOV_A0172), encoding a glucose/galactose transporter [47] is a pseudogene. B. abortus gluP mutants have a reduced ability to persist in the spleens of mice [48], suggesting that the ability to utilize these carbon sources may be important for systemic persistence of the human pathogenic Brucella species. However B. suis also lacks GluP and is able to oxidize glucose and galactose, suggesting that additional functions are lacking in B. ovis that contribute to utilization of these carbon sources. Several predicted sugar ABC transporters (BOV_1299-BOV1301, BOV_A0278-BOV_A0282, BOV_A0645-BOV_A0648 and BOV_A1083-BOV_A1086) of unknown specificity contain pseudogenes, which may potentially reduce the ability of B. ovis to take up glucose and galactose.  Ribose  Two components, a permease and an ATP binding protein of a putative ribose ABC transport system (BOV_A0936-BOV_A0937) are pseudogenes in B. ovis, suggesting that the inability of B. ovis to utilize ribose as a sole carbon source may be the result of a reduced capacity to take up ribose from the growth medium. Similarly, a periplasmic binding protein and an ATP binding protein of a predicted ABC transporter for xylose (BOV_A1055-BOVA1056) contain frameshifts, which may underlie the inability of B. ovis to utilize xylose [40].  Oxidase phenotype  B. ovis is the only Brucella species with a negative oxidase phenotype. Oxidase phenotype depends on the activity of cytochrome C oxidase which in B. suis is encoded by at least 7 genes, four of them organized in one operon, BR0363-BR0360 (ccoNOQP), together with BR0467 (coxB), encoding cytochrome c oxidase, subunit II, BR0468 (coxA) encoding cytochrome c oxidase, subunit I and BR0472 (coxC) encoding cytochrome c oxidase, subunit III. In B. ovis, the operon ccoNOQP (BOV_0376-BOV_0379), encoding the cb type cytochrome c oxidase is well conserved, except the gene ccoO (BOV_0378), which contains a frameshift generated by deletion of an A near its 5′ end, is a pseudogene. The B. ovis coxB gene (BOV_0473) contains a frameshift that very probably inactivates the gene, while coxA (BOV_0474) differs only in two residues with the B. suis product. The last 6 amino acids of coxC (BOV_0478) are lost as result of a short deletion (56 bp) that fuses this product with the next, apparently unrelated Orf. A short repeated sequence (GGGGCGGC) at both ends of the deletion seems to be responsible for this rearrangement. These genomic differences may be responsible for the oxidase negative phenotype of B. ovis.  Nitrogen metabolism  Several genes encoded in the B. suis genome with inferred functions in nitrogen metabolism are not predicted to be functional in the B. ovis genome. The genes norB (BOV_A0225), encoding the large subunit of nitric oxide reductase, and nosX (BOV_A0256), a gene of unknown function in the operon encoding nitric oxide synthase, are pseudogenes in B. ovis. The third gene, narK (BOV_A0276), encoding a nitrite extrusion protein, is degenerate, as was found in the B. melitensis and B. abortus 2308 genomes [21]. Nitric oxide reductase is required for survival and persistence of B. suis in mice [49], suggesting that lack of this activity in B. ovis may contribute to its restricted tissue tropism and host range.  A locus that contributes to growth of E. coli on aspartate as a nitrogen source, xanthine dehydrogenase (BOV_0365-BOV_0367;  [50]) contains a pseudogene in B. ovis, suggesting a further defect in nitrogen metabolism. Further, this locus could function in salvage pathways for purine nucleotides, which could contribute to nitrogen metabolism. A correlation between a defective purine nucleotide salvage pathway and reduced ability of B. ovis to survive intracellularly would be consistent with the importance of purine biosynthetic pathways for full virulence of B. abortus and B. melitensis  [51], [52]. Further, a homolog of Sinorhizobium meliloti fixI (BOV_0373), encoding an cation pump involved in symbiotic nitrogen fixation [53], is inactivated by a point mutation in the B. ovis genome. As the function of the fixGHI genes in Brucella spp. has not been determined, the biological significance of this gene inactivation for B. ovis is currently unknown.  Host-pathogen interactions  Lipopolysaccharide  B. ovis is known to have a rough LPS phenotype, which given the critical role of O-antigen in pathogenicity of B. abortus, B. suis and B. melitensis, likely contributes to its reduced pathogenicity for laboratory animals compared to other Brucella spp. [8], [54], [55]. As mentioned above, the wboA gene is missing from B. ovis, as well as a second, genetically linked glycosyltransferase. Pseudogenes with a possible function in LPS biosynthesis include a glycosyltransferase (BOV_A0475), an LpxA family acetyltransferase (BOV_A0367) and a putative undecaprenylphosphate alpha-N-acetylglucosamine transferase (BOV_A0371) of which the latter may also be involved in murein biosynthesis. While it is known that B. ovis LPS has a higher affinity for antimicrobial peptides than that of B. abortus, it is unknown whether differences in LPS structure compared to smooth Brucella species affect the interaction of B. ovis LPS with toll-like receptors of the innate immune system [56], [57].  Type IV secretion system (T4SS)  The T4SS, encoded by virB1-virB12, is an essential virulence factor in B. abortus, B. suis, and B. melitensis  [48], [58]–[60]. The genes virB1-VirB12 are intact in the B. ovis genome, suggesting that this system is functional. Further, the gene encoding its transcriptional activator VjbR (BOVA_0110;  [61]) is conserved. These findings are consistent with the detection of VirB5 and VirB8 expression in B. ovis  [62]. Two co-regulated genes identified as encoding T4SS substrates, vceA (BOV_1577) and vceC (BOV_1003) are present in B. ovis, however it is currently unknown whether there may be additional T4SS effectors in other Brucella spp. that are absent from B. ovis  [63]. A recent report showing that B. ovis strain PA is able to replicate in macrophages and HeLa cells at a rate similar to that of B. abortus suggests that its T4SS is functional [64].  Autotransporter proteins  Four predicted autotransporters have been identified in the sequenced Brucella genomes. Each of the sequenced Brucella genomes is predicted to encode a different combination of autotransporters [21], suggesting that none of these four proteins is essential for virulence, but that different combinations of autotransporters may contribute to observed differences in tissue tropism and host preference. The B. ovis genome is predicted to encode three functional autotransporters, corresponding to B. suis BR0072, BRA0173 and BRA1148, (BOV_0071, BOV_A0152 and BOV_A1053) while the fourth gene, BOV_1937, corresponding to BR2013, is degenerate. These proteins show a range in similarity (at the amino acid level) to their B. suis counterparts, from 99% between BRA1148 and BOV_A1053, to 86% similarity between BOV_A0152 and BRA0173. BR2013, designated omaA, is a pseudogene in both B. abortus and B. melitensis, and was noted to have a polymorphism with unknown functional effects in the genome of vaccine strain B. abortus 19 [65]. Since the product of this gene has been shown to contribute to persistence of B. suis in mice [66], it is possible that lack of a functional OmaA autotransporter in B. ovis may contribute to its limited tissue tropism and host range. However, the finding that all four autotransporter genes are predicted to be pseudogenes in B. melitensis, shows that they are not absolutely required for infectivity and transmission.  Immunomodulatory functions  In addition to the T4SS, several genes implicated in modulation of the immune response by Brucella spp., are well-conserved in B. ovis ATCC25840. These include btp1, encoding the TIR domain protein, an inhibitor of TLR2 signaling, the B cell mitogen encoded by prpA, and cyclic β-glucan synthase [67]–[70].  Outer membrane proteins  The two component regulator BvrR/BvrS, which has been shown to be a master regulator of many virulence-associated functions [71], [72], appears intact in B. ovis. However, a putative envZ osmosensor (BOV_A0412) is a pseudogene. Two genes shown to encode outer membrane proteins in other Brucella species omp2a (BOV_0632  [73]) and omp31 (BOV_1565; [74]), contain point mutations in B. ovis. For Omp31, the point mutation is predicted to lead to a truncation in the protein. It was found previously that the outer membrane of B. ovis is more susceptible to cationic peptides than a rough B. abortus mutant [56], suggesting that together with the defects in LPS biosynthesis discussed above, these defects in outer membrane components may further compromise the cell envelope stability of B. ovis making it less able to survive environmental stresses.  Perspective  The unique biology of Brucella ovis compared to the human pathogenic species appears to be in part the result of genome degradation. Worldwide, the majority of human brucellosis cases occur via ingestion of contaminated dairy products. B. ovis is not known to cause human infection, despite worldwide consumption of unpasteurized sheep's milk, where B. ovis has been detected [38]. Oral transmission, although feasible in experimental conditions, does not appear to be one of the main routes of infection for B. ovis, whereas passive venereal transmission via the ewe is the most important one [75]. This suggests that this species has lost the ability to infect via the oral route. One genomic change that may contribute to this loss of oral infectivity is the loss of an important virulence factor, urease, that is required for survival of stomach acidity by Brucella spp [36], [37]. Urease has also been shown to contribute to the establishment of Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae infection in pigs through the respiratory tract [76]. If this mechanism is also operative in Brucella spp., then it is possible that B. ovis is also deficient in establishing infections not only by the digestive route but also via aerosol inhalation, which are the two main routes of infection by human pathogenic Brucella spp. Additional genes that seem to be non-functional in B. ovis could also contribute to reduce the number of transmission routes compared to other Brucella species. A characteristic of B. ovis is its tropism for the ovine male genital tract, which presents as epididymo-orchitis [8]. Since other Brucella species, especially B. melitensis are known to cause epididymo-orchitis in human patients [77], the predilection of B. ovis to cause epididymo-orchitis in rams likely represents a loss of functions required to target to other tissues. However, due to the large number of genes in the B. ovis genome with unknown function, a gain of functions that allow for increased colonization of the male genital tract cannot be ruled out based on the genome sequence.

PMC2677664,Abstract,Abstract,NC_009504,1,0,0,,,"  Brucella ovis is a veterinary pathogen associated with epididymitis in sheep. Despite its genetic similarity to the zoonotic pathogens B. abortus, B. melitensis and B. suis, B. ovis does not cause zoonotic disease. Genomic analysis of the type strain ATCC25840 revealed a high percentage of pseudogenes and increased numbers of transposable elements compared to the zoonotic Brucella species, suggesting that genome degradation has occurred concomitant with narrowing of the host range of B. ovis. The absence of genomic island 2, encoding functions required for lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis, as well as inactivation of genes encoding urease, nutrient uptake and utilization, and outer membrane proteins may be factors contributing to the avirulence of B. ovis for humans. A 26.5 kb region of B. ovis ATCC25840 Chromosome II was absent from all the sequenced human pathogenic Brucella genomes, but was present in all of 17 B. ovis isolates tested and in three B. ceti isolates, suggesting that this DNA region may be of use for differentiating B. ovis from other Brucella spp. This is the first genomic analysis of a non-zoonotic Brucella species. The results suggest that inactivation of genes involved in nutrient acquisition and utilization, cell envelope structure and urease may have played a role in narrowing of the tissue tropism and host range of B. ovis.

PMC2677664,Introduction,Introduction,NC_009504,1,0,0,,,"  Introduction  Although previous studies have supported the notion of Brucella as a monospecies genus with different biotypes [1], it is still largely accepted that the genus Brucella is divided into six species, named according to their preferential hosts. Each one of the species is host-adapted, but not host-restricted [2]–[4]. Four of the six Brucella species, namely B. melitensis, B. abortus, B. suis, and B. canis, are capable of causing human disease. B. melitensis and B. suis are the most pathogenic, whereas B. abortus is considered of moderate pathogenicity, and B. canis is considered of low pathogenicity for humans. There are no reports of human infections with B. ovis or B. neotomae  [3]. In addition to the six classical Brucella species, Brucella has also been isolated from marine mammals, and two species, B. pinnipedialis and B. ceti have been proposed [5]. Brucella isolates from marine mammals can cause human infections, with one reported case of infection due to laboratory exposure [6], and two reported cases of natural infections resulting in neurological disease [7].  Brucella ovis was initially recognized in the beginning of the 1950's in New Zealand and Australia as a bacterial agent associated with epididymitis and abortion in sheep [8]. Since then this organism has been isolated in several countries [9], and is considered one of the most important causes of ovine infertility, with a significant economic impact on the sheep industry [10]. B. ovis has a worldwide distribution in areas where sheep are economically significant, with the exception of the Great Britain [9]. The prevalence in herds ranges from 9.1 to 46.7% [11], and the seroprevalence within positive herds varies between 2.1 to 67% [11]–[14].  B. ovis is stably rough, and it is one of the two classical Brucella species that do not have zoonotic potential. In sheep, the organism causes either clinical or sub-clinical chronic infections characterized by epididymitis, orchitis, male infertility, and occasionally abortion in pregnant ewes [15]. Sexually mature rams are more susceptible than young males [16]. However, B. ovis infection may affect males as young as 4 months old [9]. Natural transmission apparently occurs through mucosal membranes, and venereal transmission is significant when a female previously mated with an infected male copulates with a second susceptible male during the same period of estrus [17]. Upon invasion through mucosal membranes, B. ovis initially resides in local lymph nodes, which is followed by bacteremia and finally colonization of the genital tract around 30 days post infection [18]. The factors defining the genital tropism of this organism remain unknown.  Sequencing of B. melitensis, and B. suis genomes demonstrated a high level of similarity between the two genomes, with over 90% of the genes having more than 98–100% nucleotide identity [19]. Furthermore, comparison between these two species resulted in the identification of only 32 and 43 genes that were unique to B. melitensis and B. suis, respectively. This level of variability is remarkably low even when compared to variations between serotypes within the same bacterial species such as in serotypes Typhi and Typhimurium of Samonella enterica  [20]. More recently, the complete genome sequence of B. abortus (strains 9–941 and 2308) became available confirming the striking similarity both among different species of Brucella and within the species B. abortus  [21], [22]. Comparisons between these three Brucella species revealed more than 94% identity at the nucleotide level. In addition, comparisons between the genomes of the two B. abortus strains that have been sequenced (9–941 and 2308) resulted in identification of only a small number of strain-specific deletions and polymorphisms [21]. The genetic similarity among Brucella species has been confirmed by whole genome hybridizations [23]. Together these studies support the original hybridization studies performed more than 20 years ago suggesting that Brucella is a monospecific genus from the genetic point of view [1]. Considering the high level of identity among Brucella species pathogenic to humans, the comparison of those species with a Brucella lacking the potential to cause human infections may bring new insights into host specificity and pathogenesis. In this study we present the genome analysis of the rough non-human-pathogen Brucella ovis and compare its genome with those of the zoonotic Brucella spp. Our analysis focused on two sets of genomic features (i) deletions and gene degradation that could potentially result in loss of virulence factors important for infection of hosts other than sheep, and (ii) B. ovis-specific genes that could contribute to genital tract tropism or cause a reduction in virulence for non-ovine hosts.

PMC2677664,Materials and Methods,Materials and Methods,NC_009504,1,0,1,,Brief summary of dataset production,"  Materials and Methods  Genome sequencing and annotation  The complete genome sequence of Brucella ovis strain ATCC25840 was determined using the whole-genome shotgun method as previously described [78]. Physical and sequencing gaps were closed using a combination of primer walking, generation and sequencing of transposon-tagged libraries of large-insert clones, and multiplex PCR [79]. Identification of putative protein-encoding genes and annotation of the genome were performed as previously described [24]. An initial set of genes predicted to encode proteins was identified with GLIMMER [80]. Genes consisting of fewer than 30 codons and those containing overlaps were eliminated. Frame shifts and point mutations were corrected or designated ‘authentic.’ Functional assignment, identification of membrane-spanning domains, and determination of paralogous gene families were performed as previously described [24]. Sequence alignments and phylogenetic trees were generated using the methods described previously [24].  Trinucleotide composition  Distribution of all 64 trinucleotides (3-mers) was determined, and the 3-mer distribution in 1,000-bp windows that overlapped by half their length (500 bp) across the genome was computed. For each window, we computed the χ2 statistic on the difference between its 3-mer content and that of the whole chromosome. A large value for indicates the 3-mer composition in this window is different from the rest of the chromosome (minimum of two standard deviations). Probability values for this analysis are based on assumptions that the DNA composition is relatively uniform throughout the genome, and that 3-mer composition is independent. Because these assumptions may be incorrect, we prefer to interpret high χ2 values as indicators of regions on the chromosome that appear unusual and demand further scrutiny.  Comparative genomics  The B. ovis ATCC25840 genome was compared to the genomes of B. suis 1330, B. abortus 2308, B. abortus 9-941, and B. melitensis 16M (PATRIC), at the nucleotide level by suffix tree analysis using MUMmer [81], and the predicted B. ovis CDSs were compared with the gene sets from the other sequenced Brucella genomes by BLAST and by HMM paralogous family searches, as previously described [82].  Analysis of the B. ovis-specific island  Genomic DNA from B. ovis strains and other Brucella species (B. melitensis, B. suis, B. abortus, B. canis, B. neotomae, and B. pinnipedialis) were subjected to PCR amplification of 12 target sequences within the B. ovis-specific island. PCR reactions were performed using 13 µL of a commercial PCR mix (PCR Supermix, Invitrogen, USA), 0.75 µL of a 25 µM solution of each primer (Supplementary Table S1), and 1 µL of DNA (100 to 500 ng per reaction). Cycling parameters were denaturation at 95°C for 5 minutes; 35 cycles of denaturation (95°C for 1 min seconds), annealing (55°C for 1 min), and extension (72°C for 1 min); and a final extension at 72°C for 5 min. PCR products were resolved by agarose gel electrophoresis.  GenBank accession  The genomic sequence data are available at GenBank under accession numbers NC_009505 (Chromosome I) and NC_009504 (Chromosome II).  ",TRUE,TRUE,

The genome of this strain consists of two circular chromosomes of 2,111,370 bp (Chromosome I; NCBI Accession Number NC_009505) and 1,164,220 bp (Chromosome II; NCBI Accession Number NC_009504), which are predicted to encode a total of 2890 proteins, 1928 on ChrI and 962 on ChrII (Table 1). Features of the B. ovis genome are summarized in Table 1. Comparison with the sequenced genomes of B. suis (GenBank Accession numbers NC_004310 and NC_004311) [24], B. abortus (GenBank Accession numbers NC_007618 and NC_007624) [21], [22] and B. melitensis 16M (GenBank Accession numbers NC_003317 and NC_003318) [19] shows a large degree of conservation, particularly in the % G+C content and size of the chromosomes. This comparison also revealed several species-specific differences, including regions missing from B. ovis relative to the other sequenced Brucella genomes and genes unique to B. ovis. These differences are listed in Table 1 and Figures 1–2, and are discussed below.  10.1371/journal.pone.0005519.g001  Figure 1  Whole genome alignment of sequenced Brucella strains.  The five genomes were compared to each other by using COG, BLAST and HMM analyses. Each genome is colored with a gradient that ranges from yellow (nucleotide 1) to blue (end). Differences in color between a reference sequence (the bottom colored line in each set) and the other genomes indicate conserved protein-coding regions that have been rearranged.

Comparative best-match blastp searches identified 2282 annotated proteins in B. ovis that are shared with B. suis, B. melitensis and B. abortus, 79% of the annotated proteome. Nonetheless, this analysis suggested that the B. ovis genome lacks 675, 610 and 539 protein coding genes annotated in B. suis, B. melitensis and B. abortus 2308, respectively (Table S3). To determine whether these genes are truly absent from the B. ovis genome they were compared to the B. ovis chromosomal sequences using blastn searches. Interestingly, good matches were found for 64, 125 and 18 genes thought to be lacking in B. ovis in the genomes of B. suis, B. melitensis and B. abortus 2308, respectively (Table S3). There are several possible reasons for these genes not being highlighted as shared using comparative best-match blastp searches, e.g., they may be pseudogenes in B. ovis and therefore, not part of the predicted proteome, they may be the products of duplications where only one duplication product is matched in best match searches or differences in gene annotation between the strains resulted in these sequences not being annotated as a protein coding gene in B. ovis. In total only 33 annotated protein coding genes in B. ovis are unique to this species.  Genomic rearrangements  Gradient figures were used to compare the chromosomes of B. ovis with those of the other sequenced Brucella genomes. No large inversions or rearrangements were observed in the B. ovis genome compared to the sequenced genomes of B. suis or B. melitensis (Figure 1).  Genomic deletions  Chromosome I  Four deletions of 4 kb or larger were identified in the B. ovis genome, compared to its closest relative, B. suis. Chromosome I lacks a 15 kb region that encompasses B. suis BR0966-BR0987. Interestingly, in B. suis, this region is inserted into the sequence of tRNAgly and is adjacent to a phage integrase-like gene, features suggestive of horizontal gene transfer. This region contains the wboA glycosyl transferase gene, shown to be essential for lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis [25], and a second glycosyl transferase, as well as several hypothetical proteins. The lack of the two glycosyl transferases likely contributes to the rough LPS phenotype of B. ovis. These findings were in agreement with previous reports by Vizcaino et al and Rajashekara et al [23], [26] showing the absence of these genes from B. ovis.  A second deletion on Chromosome I of 7745 bp encompasses BR1078-BR1083. This island in B. suis contains three hypothetical genes and two site specific recombinases and is flanked by two tRNA-Leu genes, of which one remains in B. ovis. A smaller deletion of 3954 bp on Chromosome I has led to loss of two genes (BR1852-BR1853) encoding a transcriptional regulator and a protein predicted to be a branched chain amino acid permease. This deletion is also associated with transposable elements, as these two genes in B. suis are flanked by copies of IS2020  [27], one of which remains in B. ovis.  Chromosome II  The 44.5 kb island in B. suis (BRA1074-BRA1113; [28]), containing four predicted ABC transport systems and three transcriptional regulators, is absent from the B. ovis genome. The presence of two copies of IS1239 flanking two pseudogenes in B. ovis suggests that this is the result of a loss of this region by recombination.  The 18.3 kb IncP island on B. suis Chromosome II containing BRA0362-BRA0379, previously reported to be present in B. suis biovars 1–4, B. canis, B. neotomae, and marine mammal isolates but missing in B. melitensis  [24], [28], is also absent from the B. ovis genome, as reported by Lavigne and colleagues [28].  Unique genomic regions  Chromosome II, contains an island of 26.5 kb (BOV_A0482-BOV_A0515) with structure suggestive of a composite transposon (Fig. 2). This island likely overlaps the B. ovis-specific 21-kb SpeI fragment of the small chromosome identified previously by genome mapping [29]. Proteins encoded on the island include transposases, an ABC transporter, a putative hemagglutinin, and several hypothetical proteins. This region is present in 17/17 B. ovis strains tested, suggesting a high level of conservation within the species (Supplementary Table S2). Interestingly, the predicted product of BOV_A0497 exhibits similarity to antitoxins of toxin-antitoxin maintenance systems [30], suggesting a possible selective pressure for maintenance of this genetic island in B. ovis. Genome sequence data and analysis of the island by PCR showed that this region is absent from the genomes of B. suis, B. abortus, B. melitensis, B. canis and B. neotomae (Table 2), suggesting initially that it may be specific to B. ovis. However, we detected this island in three marine isolates of Brucella from captive bottlenose dolphins [31], [32]. The protein coding genes within this unique region constitute the majority of the unique protein coding genes in B. ovis (Supplementary Table S3).  10.1371/journal.pone.0005519.t002  Table 2  Detection of the B. ovis genomic island in Brucella species  Species  ORF  Brucella ovis  B. melitensis  B. abortus  B. suis  B. canis  B. neotomae  B. ceti (Muu)  B. ceti (Cudo)  B. ceti (Nor)  NTC1  A0492  +  −  −  −  −  −  +  +  +  −  A0495  +  −  −  −  −  −  +  +  +  −  A0496  +  −  −  −  −  −  +  +  +  −  A0497  +  −  −  −  −  −  +  +  +  −  A0500  +  −  −  −  −  −  +  +  +  −  A0502  +  −  −  −  −  −  +  +  +  −  A0503  +  −  −  −  −  −  +  +  +  −  A0504  +  −  −  −  −  −  +  +  +  −  A0505  +  −  −  −  −  −  +  +  +  −  A0506  +  −  −  −  −  −  +  +  +  −  A0511  +  −  −  −  −  −  +  +  +  −  A0512  +  −  −  −  −  −  +  +  +  −  BR06152  +  +  +  +  +  +  +  +  +  −  1  NTC, no template control  2  Positive control for amplification reaction  Transposable elements  The genome of B. ovis contains 38 complete copies of IS711, confirming previous estimates obtained by hybridization [33]. 25 of the copies are located in Chromosome I, and 13 in Chromosome II. Interestingly, several of these copies appear to be expanded clonally, suggesting that they could be active in B. ovis. In 17 cases, IS711 is inserted in copies of a repeated sequence of the BruRS family [34]. Five of the IS711 copies appear to disrupt genes, which could be a contributing factor to the general process of genome degradation observed in B. ovis. A case of special interest is the B. ovis-specific island (see above), where a 25 kb region between two copies of IS711 in B. ovis is absent in all the other sequenced species, suggestive of either deletion by recombination between the two copies in the other Brucella species, or of acquisition of the region with duplication of IS711.  Pseudogenes  It has been proposed that the unique complement of pseudogenes in each of the Brucella species may contribute to their differing degrees of infectivity and host preference [21], [22]. Interestingly B. abortus, which is less virulent for humans than B. suis and B. melitensis, has a greater number of pseudogenes (316) than B. suis 1330 (62) or B. melitensis 16M (163) (Table 1). Similar to B. abortus, the B. ovis genome contains a large number of pseudogenes with 244 identified. The small chromosome contains more pseudogenes (125; 11.3%) than the large chromosome (119; 5.7%) (Table 1). Of the 244 B. ovis pseudogenes, 40 are hypothetical or conserved hypothetical genes, 62 have predicted transport functions, 23 are defective transposases, and 14 are predicted to have regulatory functions. The finding that some pseudogenes in the B. melitensis flagellar region encode full-length proteins raises the question of whether some pseudogenes in B. ovis may also be functional [35].  Metabolism  Urease  Based on biotyping, B. ovis is urease-negative. However it contains the two urease clusters described in all the other sequenced Brucella genomes. Urease has been reported to be important for the ability of B. abortus  [36] and B. suis  [37] to survive passage through the stomach in the mouse model of infection. The importance of urease for oral infection is consistent with a lack of human infections observed with B. ovis, despite identification of this organism in the milk of infected ewes [38]. The ure1 cluster is the only one showing urease activity at least in B. abortus, B. melitensis, and B. suis  [36], [37], while the ure2 does not have any demonstrable urease activity. The ure1 cluster of B. ovis contains several point mutations that are predicted to result in conserved changes shared by at least one other urease positive species. However, UreC1 contains a 30 bp deletion that would cause a loss of 10 amino acids in UreC1. Although all the residues described to be important for enzymatic activity of UreC1 are conserved [39], this deletion must render the urease inactive. Moreover, complementation with the ureC1 gene from B. melitensis (Sangari, unpublished results) results in urease activity. Regarding the ure2 cluster, ureF2 (BOV_1316) and ureT (BOV_1319) are pseudogenes, while the remaining genes are conserved, suggesting that this cluster could encode an unknown activity.  Sugar metabolism  B. ovis is defective in oxidative metabolism of arabinose, galactose, ribose, xylose, glucose and erythritol [40]. Analysis of the genome sequence reveals a possible basis for these metabolic defects in B. ovis relative to the human pathogenic Brucella species. Several putative sugar transporters predicted to be functional in other Brucella species appear to be inactivated by frameshifts, point mutations or gene degradation in B. ovis. Further, pckA encoding phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (BOV_2009) is inactivated by frameshift, which would affect the gluconeogenesis pathway and the ability of B. ovis to utilize pyruvate, amino acids, or glycerol as carbon sources.  Erythritol  Erythritol is the preferred carbon source of B. abortus  [41], [42]. Erythritol is metabolized in Brucella by the enzymes encoded in the eryABCD operon[43] Moreover, it has been recently described that the carbohydrate transport system located upstream of the ery operon constitutes the erythritol transport system in Rhizobium leguminosarum bv. Viciae  [44], and that the operon immediately downstream also forms part of the erythritol catabolic pathway. Microarray experiments have revealed that these three operons are regulated by erythritol in B. abortus, reinforcing that the three clusters participate in erythritol catabolism (Sangari et al, unpublished). B. ovis does not oxidize erythritol, and it is not inhibited by its presence in the growth media. This is reflected in the genome by the presence of a stop codon in eryA (BOV_A0811) and a frameshift in eryD (BOV_A0814) that render them pseudogenes. In addition two genes of the putative ABC erythritol transport system, eryF and eryG (BOV_A805 and BOV_A806)) carry mutations that render them pseudogenes (a 2 bp deletion resulting in an premature stop codon). The mutation in eryD could have an effect in the over expression of all genes of the ery system. On the contrary, mutations in the transport genes and in eryA block the entry of erythritol in the cell and its phosphorylation, avoiding the accumulation of toxic intermediates and the depletion of ATP observed in the vaccine strain S19 [45]. The accumulation of mutations in these two clusters suggest that they may no longer be needed by B. ovis. The third cluster is intact, and the enzymes use substrates that are central (or core) carbohydrate metabolites such as dihydroxyacetone phosphate, glyceraldehydes-3-phosphate, and other three carbon compounds that can be produced after decarboxylation of erythritol and its derivatives.  While it has been hypothesized that erythritol may serve as a carbon source during growth of B. abortus, B. suis, and B. melitensis in the placenta of their natural hosts, an analysis of deletion mutants in these models has not been reported. However, the lower incidence of abortion in sheep flocks infected with B. ovis compared to B. melitensis correlates with the inability of B. ovis to use erythritol as a carbon source. Mutants in eryB and eryC have been described to have a limited ability to grow in macrophages [46]. This limitation may well contribute to the limited virulence of B. ovis.  Glucose and Galactose  Unlike B. melitensis, B. abortus and B. suis, B. ovis is unable to grow on glucose or galactose as a primary carbon source [40]. Analysis of genes involved in uptake and utilization of these carbon sources reveals that B. ovis gluP (BOV_A0172), encoding a glucose/galactose transporter [47] is a pseudogene. B. abortus gluP mutants have a reduced ability to persist in the spleens of mice [48], suggesting that the ability to utilize these carbon sources may be important for systemic persistence of the human pathogenic Brucella species. However B. suis also lacks GluP and is able to oxidize glucose and galactose, suggesting that additional functions are lacking in B. ovis that contribute to utilization of these carbon sources. Several predicted sugar ABC transporters (BOV_1299-BOV1301, BOV_A0278-BOV_A0282, BOV_A0645-BOV_A0648 and BOV_A1083-BOV_A1086) of unknown specificity contain pseudogenes, which may potentially reduce the ability of B. ovis to take up glucose and galactose.  Ribose  Two components, a permease and an ATP binding protein of a putative ribose ABC transport system (BOV_A0936-BOV_A0937) are pseudogenes in B. ovis, suggesting that the inability of B. ovis to utilize ribose as a sole carbon source may be the result of a reduced capacity to take up ribose from the growth medium. Similarly, a periplasmic binding protein and an ATP binding protein of a predicted ABC transporter for xylose (BOV_A1055-BOVA1056) contain frameshifts, which may underlie the inability of B. ovis to utilize xylose [40].  Oxidase phenotype  B. ovis is the only Brucella species with a negative oxidase phenotype. Oxidase phenotype depends on the activity of cytochrome C oxidase which in B. suis is encoded by at least 7 genes, four of them organized in one operon, BR0363-BR0360 (ccoNOQP), together with BR0467 (coxB), encoding cytochrome c oxidase, subunit II, BR0468 (coxA) encoding cytochrome c oxidase, subunit I and BR0472 (coxC) encoding cytochrome c oxidase, subunit III. In B. ovis, the operon ccoNOQP (BOV_0376-BOV_0379), encoding the cb type cytochrome c oxidase is well conserved, except the gene ccoO (BOV_0378), which contains a frameshift generated by deletion of an A near its 5′ end, is a pseudogene. The B. ovis coxB gene (BOV_0473) contains a frameshift that very probably inactivates the gene, while coxA (BOV_0474) differs only in two residues with the B. suis product. The last 6 amino acids of coxC (BOV_0478) are lost as result of a short deletion (56 bp) that fuses this product with the next, apparently unrelated Orf. A short repeated sequence (GGGGCGGC) at both ends of the deletion seems to be responsible for this rearrangement. These genomic differences may be responsible for the oxidase negative phenotype of B. ovis.  Nitrogen metabolism  Several genes encoded in the B. suis genome with inferred functions in nitrogen metabolism are not predicted to be functional in the B. ovis genome. The genes norB (BOV_A0225), encoding the large subunit of nitric oxide reductase, and nosX (BOV_A0256), a gene of unknown function in the operon encoding nitric oxide synthase, are pseudogenes in B. ovis. The third gene, narK (BOV_A0276), encoding a nitrite extrusion protein, is degenerate, as was found in the B. melitensis and B. abortus 2308 genomes [21]. Nitric oxide reductase is required for survival and persistence of B. suis in mice [49], suggesting that lack of this activity in B. ovis may contribute to its restricted tissue tropism and host range.  A locus that contributes to growth of E. coli on aspartate as a nitrogen source, xanthine dehydrogenase (BOV_0365-BOV_0367;  [50]) contains a pseudogene in B. ovis, suggesting a further defect in nitrogen metabolism. Further, this locus could function in salvage pathways for purine nucleotides, which could contribute to nitrogen metabolism. A correlation between a defective purine nucleotide salvage pathway and reduced ability of B. ovis to survive intracellularly would be consistent with the importance of purine biosynthetic pathways for full virulence of B. abortus and B. melitensis  [51], [52]. Further, a homolog of Sinorhizobium meliloti fixI (BOV_0373), encoding an cation pump involved in symbiotic nitrogen fixation [53], is inactivated by a point mutation in the B. ovis genome. As the function of the fixGHI genes in Brucella spp. has not been determined, the biological significance of this gene inactivation for B. ovis is currently unknown.  Host-pathogen interactions  Lipopolysaccharide  B. ovis is known to have a rough LPS phenotype, which given the critical role of O-antigen in pathogenicity of B. abortus, B. suis and B. melitensis, likely contributes to its reduced pathogenicity for laboratory animals compared to other Brucella spp. [8], [54], [55]. As mentioned above, the wboA gene is missing from B. ovis, as well as a second, genetically linked glycosyltransferase. Pseudogenes with a possible function in LPS biosynthesis include a glycosyltransferase (BOV_A0475), an LpxA family acetyltransferase (BOV_A0367) and a putative undecaprenylphosphate alpha-N-acetylglucosamine transferase (BOV_A0371) of which the latter may also be involved in murein biosynthesis. While it is known that B. ovis LPS has a higher affinity for antimicrobial peptides than that of B. abortus, it is unknown whether differences in LPS structure compared to smooth Brucella species affect the interaction of B. ovis LPS with toll-like receptors of the innate immune system [56], [57].  Type IV secretion system (T4SS)  The T4SS, encoded by virB1-virB12, is an essential virulence factor in B. abortus, B. suis, and B. melitensis  [48], [58]–[60]. The genes virB1-VirB12 are intact in the B. ovis genome, suggesting that this system is functional. Further, the gene encoding its transcriptional activator VjbR (BOVA_0110;  [61]) is conserved. These findings are consistent with the detection of VirB5 and VirB8 expression in B. ovis  [62]. Two co-regulated genes identified as encoding T4SS substrates, vceA (BOV_1577) and vceC (BOV_1003) are present in B. ovis, however it is currently unknown whether there may be additional T4SS effectors in other Brucella spp. that are absent from B. ovis  [63]. A recent report showing that B. ovis strain PA is able to replicate in macrophages and HeLa cells at a rate similar to that of B. abortus suggests that its T4SS is functional [64].  Autotransporter proteins  Four predicted autotransporters have been identified in the sequenced Brucella genomes. Each of the sequenced Brucella genomes is predicted to encode a different combination of autotransporters [21], suggesting that none of these four proteins is essential for virulence, but that different combinations of autotransporters may contribute to observed differences in tissue tropism and host preference. The B. ovis genome is predicted to encode three functional autotransporters, corresponding to B. suis BR0072, BRA0173 and BRA1148, (BOV_0071, BOV_A0152 and BOV_A1053) while the fourth gene, BOV_1937, corresponding to BR2013, is degenerate. These proteins show a range in similarity (at the amino acid level) to their B. suis counterparts, from 99% between BRA1148 and BOV_A1053, to 86% similarity between BOV_A0152 and BRA0173. BR2013, designated omaA, is a pseudogene in both B. abortus and B. melitensis, and was noted to have a polymorphism with unknown functional effects in the genome of vaccine strain B. abortus 19 [65]. Since the product of this gene has been shown to contribute to persistence of B. suis in mice [66], it is possible that lack of a functional OmaA autotransporter in B. ovis may contribute to its limited tissue tropism and host range. However, the finding that all four autotransporter genes are predicted to be pseudogenes in B. melitensis, shows that they are not absolutely required for infectivity and transmission.  Immunomodulatory functions  In addition to the T4SS, several genes implicated in modulation of the immune response by Brucella spp., are well-conserved in B. ovis ATCC25840. These include btp1, encoding the TIR domain protein, an inhibitor of TLR2 signaling, the B cell mitogen encoded by prpA, and cyclic β-glucan synthase [67]–[70].  Outer membrane proteins  The two component regulator BvrR/BvrS, which has been shown to be a master regulator of many virulence-associated functions [71], [72], appears intact in B. ovis. However, a putative envZ osmosensor (BOV_A0412) is a pseudogene. Two genes shown to encode outer membrane proteins in other Brucella species omp2a (BOV_0632  [73]) and omp31 (BOV_1565; [74]), contain point mutations in B. ovis. For Omp31, the point mutation is predicted to lead to a truncation in the protein. It was found previously that the outer membrane of B. ovis is more susceptible to cationic peptides than a rough B. abortus mutant [56], suggesting that together with the defects in LPS biosynthesis discussed above, these defects in outer membrane components may further compromise the cell envelope stability of B. ovis making it less able to survive environmental stresses.  Perspective  The unique biology of Brucella ovis compared to the human pathogenic species appears to be in part the result of genome degradation. Worldwide, the majority of human brucellosis cases occur via ingestion of contaminated dairy products. B. ovis is not known to cause human infection, despite worldwide consumption of unpasteurized sheep's milk, where B. ovis has been detected [38]. Oral transmission, although feasible in experimental conditions, does not appear to be one of the main routes of infection for B. ovis, whereas passive venereal transmission via the ewe is the most important one [75]. This suggests that this species has lost the ability to infect via the oral route. One genomic change that may contribute to this loss of oral infectivity is the loss of an important virulence factor, urease, that is required for survival of stomach acidity by Brucella spp [36], [37]. Urease has also been shown to contribute to the establishment of Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae infection in pigs through the respiratory tract [76]. If this mechanism is also operative in Brucella spp., then it is possible that B. ovis is also deficient in establishing infections not only by the digestive route but also via aerosol inhalation, which are the two main routes of infection by human pathogenic Brucella spp. Additional genes that seem to be non-functional in B. ovis could also contribute to reduce the number of transmission routes compared to other Brucella species. A characteristic of B. ovis is its tropism for the ovine male genital tract, which presents as epididymo-orchitis [8]. Since other Brucella species, especially B. melitensis are known to cause epididymo-orchitis in human patients [77], the predilection of B. ovis to cause epididymo-orchitis in rams likely represents a loss of functions required to target to other tissues. However, due to the large number of genes in the B. ovis genome with unknown function, a gain of functions that allow for increased colonization of the male genital tract cannot be ruled out based on the genome sequence.

PMC2677664,Abstract,Abstract,NC_009505,1,0,0,,,"  Brucella ovis is a veterinary pathogen associated with epididymitis in sheep. Despite its genetic similarity to the zoonotic pathogens B. abortus, B. melitensis and B. suis, B. ovis does not cause zoonotic disease. Genomic analysis of the type strain ATCC25840 revealed a high percentage of pseudogenes and increased numbers of transposable elements compared to the zoonotic Brucella species, suggesting that genome degradation has occurred concomitant with narrowing of the host range of B. ovis. The absence of genomic island 2, encoding functions required for lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis, as well as inactivation of genes encoding urease, nutrient uptake and utilization, and outer membrane proteins may be factors contributing to the avirulence of B. ovis for humans. A 26.5 kb region of B. ovis ATCC25840 Chromosome II was absent from all the sequenced human pathogenic Brucella genomes, but was present in all of 17 B. ovis isolates tested and in three B. ceti isolates, suggesting that this DNA region may be of use for differentiating B. ovis from other Brucella spp. This is the first genomic analysis of a non-zoonotic Brucella species. The results suggest that inactivation of genes involved in nutrient acquisition and utilization, cell envelope structure and urease may have played a role in narrowing of the tissue tropism and host range of B. ovis.

PMC2677664,Introduction,Introduction,NC_009505,1,0,0,,,"  Introduction  Although previous studies have supported the notion of Brucella as a monospecies genus with different biotypes [1], it is still largely accepted that the genus Brucella is divided into six species, named according to their preferential hosts. Each one of the species is host-adapted, but not host-restricted [2]–[4]. Four of the six Brucella species, namely B. melitensis, B. abortus, B. suis, and B. canis, are capable of causing human disease. B. melitensis and B. suis are the most pathogenic, whereas B. abortus is considered of moderate pathogenicity, and B. canis is considered of low pathogenicity for humans. There are no reports of human infections with B. ovis or B. neotomae  [3]. In addition to the six classical Brucella species, Brucella has also been isolated from marine mammals, and two species, B. pinnipedialis and B. ceti have been proposed [5]. Brucella isolates from marine mammals can cause human infections, with one reported case of infection due to laboratory exposure [6], and two reported cases of natural infections resulting in neurological disease [7].  Brucella ovis was initially recognized in the beginning of the 1950's in New Zealand and Australia as a bacterial agent associated with epididymitis and abortion in sheep [8]. Since then this organism has been isolated in several countries [9], and is considered one of the most important causes of ovine infertility, with a significant economic impact on the sheep industry [10]. B. ovis has a worldwide distribution in areas where sheep are economically significant, with the exception of the Great Britain [9]. The prevalence in herds ranges from 9.1 to 46.7% [11], and the seroprevalence within positive herds varies between 2.1 to 67% [11]–[14].  B. ovis is stably rough, and it is one of the two classical Brucella species that do not have zoonotic potential. In sheep, the organism causes either clinical or sub-clinical chronic infections characterized by epididymitis, orchitis, male infertility, and occasionally abortion in pregnant ewes [15]. Sexually mature rams are more susceptible than young males [16]. However, B. ovis infection may affect males as young as 4 months old [9]. Natural transmission apparently occurs through mucosal membranes, and venereal transmission is significant when a female previously mated with an infected male copulates with a second susceptible male during the same period of estrus [17]. Upon invasion through mucosal membranes, B. ovis initially resides in local lymph nodes, which is followed by bacteremia and finally colonization of the genital tract around 30 days post infection [18]. The factors defining the genital tropism of this organism remain unknown.  Sequencing of B. melitensis, and B. suis genomes demonstrated a high level of similarity between the two genomes, with over 90% of the genes having more than 98–100% nucleotide identity [19]. Furthermore, comparison between these two species resulted in the identification of only 32 and 43 genes that were unique to B. melitensis and B. suis, respectively. This level of variability is remarkably low even when compared to variations between serotypes within the same bacterial species such as in serotypes Typhi and Typhimurium of Samonella enterica  [20]. More recently, the complete genome sequence of B. abortus (strains 9–941 and 2308) became available confirming the striking similarity both among different species of Brucella and within the species B. abortus  [21], [22]. Comparisons between these three Brucella species revealed more than 94% identity at the nucleotide level. In addition, comparisons between the genomes of the two B. abortus strains that have been sequenced (9–941 and 2308) resulted in identification of only a small number of strain-specific deletions and polymorphisms [21]. The genetic similarity among Brucella species has been confirmed by whole genome hybridizations [23]. Together these studies support the original hybridization studies performed more than 20 years ago suggesting that Brucella is a monospecific genus from the genetic point of view [1]. Considering the high level of identity among Brucella species pathogenic to humans, the comparison of those species with a Brucella lacking the potential to cause human infections may bring new insights into host specificity and pathogenesis. In this study we present the genome analysis of the rough non-human-pathogen Brucella ovis and compare its genome with those of the zoonotic Brucella spp. Our analysis focused on two sets of genomic features (i) deletions and gene degradation that could potentially result in loss of virulence factors important for infection of hosts other than sheep, and (ii) B. ovis-specific genes that could contribute to genital tract tropism or cause a reduction in virulence for non-ovine hosts.

Physical and sequencing gaps were closed using a combination of primer walking, generation and sequencing of transposon-tagged libraries of large-insert clones, and multiplex PCR [79]. Identification of putative protein-encoding genes and annotation of the genome were performed as previously described [24]. An initial set of genes predicted to encode proteins was identified with GLIMMER [80]. Genes consisting of fewer than 30 codons and those containing overlaps were eliminated. Frame shifts and point mutations were corrected or designated ‘authentic.’ Functional assignment, identification of membrane-spanning domains, and determination of paralogous gene families were performed as previously described [24]. Sequence alignments and phylogenetic trees were generated using the methods described previously [24].  Trinucleotide composition  Distribution of all 64 trinucleotides (3-mers) was determined, and the 3-mer distribution in 1,000-bp windows that overlapped by half their length (500 bp) across the genome was computed. For each window, we computed the χ2 statistic on the difference between its 3-mer content and that of the whole chromosome. A large value for indicates the 3-mer composition in this window is different from the rest of the chromosome (minimum of two standard deviations). Probability values for this analysis are based on assumptions that the DNA composition is relatively uniform throughout the genome, and that 3-mer composition is independent. Because these assumptions may be incorrect, we prefer to interpret high χ2 values as indicators of regions on the chromosome that appear unusual and demand further scrutiny.  Comparative genomics  The B. ovis ATCC25840 genome was compared to the genomes of B. suis 1330, B. abortus 2308, B. abortus 9-941, and B. melitensis 16M (PATRIC), at the nucleotide level by suffix tree analysis using MUMmer [81], and the predicted B. ovis CDSs were compared with the gene sets from the other sequenced Brucella genomes by BLAST and by HMM paralogous family searches, as previously described [82].  Analysis of the B. ovis-specific island  Genomic DNA from B. ovis strains and other Brucella species (B. melitensis, B. suis, B. abortus, B. canis, B. neotomae, and B. pinnipedialis) were subjected to PCR amplification of 12 target sequences within the B. ovis-specific island. PCR reactions were performed using 13 µL of a commercial PCR mix (PCR Supermix, Invitrogen, USA), 0.75 µL of a 25 µM solution of each primer (Supplementary Table S1), and 1 µL of DNA (100 to 500 ng per reaction). Cycling parameters were denaturation at 95°C for 5 minutes; 35 cycles of denaturation (95°C for 1 min seconds), annealing (55°C for 1 min), and extension (72°C for 1 min); and a final extension at 72°C for 5 min. PCR products were resolved by agarose gel electrophoresis.  GenBank accession  The genomic sequence data are available at GenBank under accession numbers NC_009505 (Chromosome I) and NC_009504 (Chromosome II).  ",TRUE,TRUE,

The genome of this strain consists of two circular chromosomes of 2,111,370 bp (Chromosome I; NCBI Accession Number NC_009505) and 1,164,220 bp (Chromosome II; NCBI Accession Number NC_009504), which are predicted to encode a total of 2890 proteins, 1928 on ChrI and 962 on ChrII (Table 1). Features of the B. ovis genome are summarized in Table 1. Comparison with the sequenced genomes of B. suis (GenBank Accession numbers NC_004310 and NC_004311) [24], B. abortus (GenBank Accession numbers NC_007618 and NC_007624) [21], [22] and B. melitensis 16M (GenBank Accession numbers NC_003317 and NC_003318) [19] shows a large degree of conservation, particularly in the % G+C content and size of the chromosomes. This comparison also revealed several species-specific differences, including regions missing from B. ovis relative to the other sequenced Brucella genomes and genes unique to B. ovis. These differences are listed in Table 1 and Figures 1–2, and are discussed below.  10.1371/journal.pone.0005519.g001  Figure 1  Whole genome alignment of sequenced Brucella strains.

Comparative best-match blastp searches identified 2282 annotated proteins in B. ovis that are shared with B. suis, B. melitensis and B. abortus, 79% of the annotated proteome. Nonetheless, this analysis suggested that the B. ovis genome lacks 675, 610 and 539 protein coding genes annotated in B. suis, B. melitensis and B. abortus 2308, respectively (Table S3). To determine whether these genes are truly absent from the B. ovis genome they were compared to the B. ovis chromosomal sequences using blastn searches. Interestingly, good matches were found for 64, 125 and 18 genes thought to be lacking in B. ovis in the genomes of B. suis, B. melitensis and B. abortus 2308, respectively (Table S3). There are several possible reasons for these genes not being highlighted as shared using comparative best-match blastp searches, e.g., they may be pseudogenes in B. ovis and therefore, not part of the predicted proteome, they may be the products of duplications where only one duplication product is matched in best match searches or differences in gene annotation between the strains resulted in these sequences not being annotated as a protein coding gene in B. ovis. In total only 33 annotated protein coding genes in B. ovis are unique to this species.  Genomic rearrangements  Gradient figures were used to compare the chromosomes of B. ovis with those of the other sequenced Brucella genomes. No large inversions or rearrangements were observed in the B. ovis genome compared to the sequenced genomes of B. suis or B. melitensis (Figure 1).  Genomic deletions  Chromosome I  Four deletions of 4 kb or larger were identified in the B. ovis genome, compared to its closest relative, B. suis. Chromosome I lacks a 15 kb region that encompasses B. suis BR0966-BR0987. Interestingly, in B. suis, this region is inserted into the sequence of tRNAgly and is adjacent to a phage integrase-like gene, features suggestive of horizontal gene transfer. This region contains the wboA glycosyl transferase gene, shown to be essential for lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis [25], and a second glycosyl transferase, as well as several hypothetical proteins. The lack of the two glycosyl transferases likely contributes to the rough LPS phenotype of B. ovis. These findings were in agreement with previous reports by Vizcaino et al and Rajashekara et al [23], [26] showing the absence of these genes from B. ovis.  A second deletion on Chromosome I of 7745 bp encompasses BR1078-BR1083. This island in B. suis contains three hypothetical genes and two site specific recombinases and is flanked by two tRNA-Leu genes, of which one remains in B. ovis. A smaller deletion of 3954 bp on Chromosome I has led to loss of two genes (BR1852-BR1853) encoding a transcriptional regulator and a protein predicted to be a branched chain amino acid permease. This deletion is also associated with transposable elements, as these two genes in B. suis are flanked by copies of IS2020  [27], one of which remains in B. ovis.  Chromosome II  The 44.5 kb island in B. suis (BRA1074-BRA1113; [28]), containing four predicted ABC transport systems and three transcriptional regulators, is absent from the B. ovis genome. The presence of two copies of IS1239 flanking two pseudogenes in B. ovis suggests that this is the result of a loss of this region by recombination.  The 18.3 kb IncP island on B. suis Chromosome II containing BRA0362-BRA0379, previously reported to be present in B. suis biovars 1–4, B. canis, B. neotomae, and marine mammal isolates but missing in B. melitensis  [24], [28], is also absent from the B. ovis genome, as reported by Lavigne and colleagues [28].  Unique genomic regions  Chromosome II, contains an island of 26.5 kb (BOV_A0482-BOV_A0515) with structure suggestive of a composite transposon (Fig. 2). This island likely overlaps the B. ovis-specific 21-kb SpeI fragment of the small chromosome identified previously by genome mapping [29]. Proteins encoded on the island include transposases, an ABC transporter, a putative hemagglutinin, and several hypothetical proteins. This region is present in 17/17 B. ovis strains tested, suggesting a high level of conservation within the species (Supplementary Table S2). Interestingly, the predicted product of BOV_A0497 exhibits similarity to antitoxins of toxin-antitoxin maintenance systems [30], suggesting a possible selective pressure for maintenance of this genetic island in B. ovis. Genome sequence data and analysis of the island by PCR showed that this region is absent from the genomes of B. suis, B. abortus, B. melitensis, B. canis and B. neotomae (Table 2), suggesting initially that it may be specific to B. ovis. However, we detected this island in three marine isolates of Brucella from captive bottlenose dolphins [31], [32]. The protein coding genes within this unique region constitute the majority of the unique protein coding genes in B. ovis (Supplementary Table S3).  10.1371/journal.pone.0005519.t002  Table 2  Detection of the B. ovis genomic island in Brucella species  Species  ORF  Brucella ovis  B. melitensis  B. abortus  B. suis  B. canis  B. neotomae  B. ceti (Muu)  B. ceti (Cudo)  B. ceti (Nor)  NTC1  A0492  +  −  −  −  −  −  +  +  +  −  A0495  +  −  −  −  −  −  +  +  +  −  A0496  +  −  −  −  −  −  +  +  +  −  A0497  +  −  −  −  −  −  +  +  +  −  A0500  +  −  −  −  −  −  +  +  +  −  A0502  +  −  −  −  −  −  +  +  +  −  A0503  +  −  −  −  −  −  +  +  +  −  A0504  +  −  −  −  −  −  +  +  +  −  A0505  +  −  −  −  −  −  +  +  +  −  A0506  +  −  −  −  −  −  +  +  +  −  A0511  +  −  −  −  −  −  +  +  +  −  A0512  +  −  −  −  −  −  +  +  +  −  BR06152  +  +  +  +  +  +  +  +  +  −  1  NTC, no template control  2  Positive control for amplification reaction  Transposable elements  The genome of B. ovis contains 38 complete copies of IS711, confirming previous estimates obtained by hybridization [33]. 25 of the copies are located in Chromosome I, and 13 in Chromosome II. Interestingly, several of these copies appear to be expanded clonally, suggesting that they could be active in B. ovis. In 17 cases, IS711 is inserted in copies of a repeated sequence of the BruRS family [34]. Five of the IS711 copies appear to disrupt genes, which could be a contributing factor to the general process of genome degradation observed in B. ovis. A case of special interest is the B. ovis-specific island (see above), where a 25 kb region between two copies of IS711 in B. ovis is absent in all the other sequenced species, suggestive of either deletion by recombination between the two copies in the other Brucella species, or of acquisition of the region with duplication of IS711.  Pseudogenes  It has been proposed that the unique complement of pseudogenes in each of the Brucella species may contribute to their differing degrees of infectivity and host preference [21], [22]. Interestingly B. abortus, which is less virulent for humans than B. suis and B. melitensis, has a greater number of pseudogenes (316) than B. suis 1330 (62) or B. melitensis 16M (163) (Table 1). Similar to B. abortus, the B. ovis genome contains a large number of pseudogenes with 244 identified. The small chromosome contains more pseudogenes (125; 11.3%) than the large chromosome (119; 5.7%) (Table 1). Of the 244 B. ovis pseudogenes, 40 are hypothetical or conserved hypothetical genes, 62 have predicted transport functions, 23 are defective transposases, and 14 are predicted to have regulatory functions. The finding that some pseudogenes in the B. melitensis flagellar region encode full-length proteins raises the question of whether some pseudogenes in B. ovis may also be functional [35].  Metabolism  Urease  Based on biotyping, B. ovis is urease-negative. However it contains the two urease clusters described in all the other sequenced Brucella genomes. Urease has been reported to be important for the ability of B. abortus  [36] and B. suis  [37] to survive passage through the stomach in the mouse model of infection. The importance of urease for oral infection is consistent with a lack of human infections observed with B. ovis, despite identification of this organism in the milk of infected ewes [38]. The ure1 cluster is the only one showing urease activity at least in B. abortus, B. melitensis, and B. suis  [36], [37], while the ure2 does not have any demonstrable urease activity. The ure1 cluster of B. ovis contains several point mutations that are predicted to result in conserved changes shared by at least one other urease positive species. However, UreC1 contains a 30 bp deletion that would cause a loss of 10 amino acids in UreC1. Although all the residues described to be important for enzymatic activity of UreC1 are conserved [39], this deletion must render the urease inactive. Moreover, complementation with the ureC1 gene from B. melitensis (Sangari, unpublished results) results in urease activity. Regarding the ure2 cluster, ureF2 (BOV_1316) and ureT (BOV_1319) are pseudogenes, while the remaining genes are conserved, suggesting that this cluster could encode an unknown activity.  Sugar metabolism  B. ovis is defective in oxidative metabolism of arabinose, galactose, ribose, xylose, glucose and erythritol [40]. Analysis of the genome sequence reveals a possible basis for these metabolic defects in B. ovis relative to the human pathogenic Brucella species. Several putative sugar transporters predicted to be functional in other Brucella species appear to be inactivated by frameshifts, point mutations or gene degradation in B. ovis. Further, pckA encoding phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (BOV_2009) is inactivated by frameshift, which would affect the gluconeogenesis pathway and the ability of B. ovis to utilize pyruvate, amino acids, or glycerol as carbon sources.  Erythritol  Erythritol is the preferred carbon source of B. abortus  [41], [42]. Erythritol is metabolized in Brucella by the enzymes encoded in the eryABCD operon[43] Moreover, it has been recently described that the carbohydrate transport system located upstream of the ery operon constitutes the erythritol transport system in Rhizobium leguminosarum bv. Viciae  [44], and that the operon immediately downstream also forms part of the erythritol catabolic pathway. Microarray experiments have revealed that these three operons are regulated by erythritol in B. abortus, reinforcing that the three clusters participate in erythritol catabolism (Sangari et al, unpublished). B. ovis does not oxidize erythritol, and it is not inhibited by its presence in the growth media. This is reflected in the genome by the presence of a stop codon in eryA (BOV_A0811) and a frameshift in eryD (BOV_A0814) that render them pseudogenes. In addition two genes of the putative ABC erythritol transport system, eryF and eryG (BOV_A805 and BOV_A806)) carry mutations that render them pseudogenes (a 2 bp deletion resulting in an premature stop codon). The mutation in eryD could have an effect in the over expression of all genes of the ery system. On the contrary, mutations in the transport genes and in eryA block the entry of erythritol in the cell and its phosphorylation, avoiding the accumulation of toxic intermediates and the depletion of ATP observed in the vaccine strain S19 [45]. The accumulation of mutations in these two clusters suggest that they may no longer be needed by B. ovis. The third cluster is intact, and the enzymes use substrates that are central (or core) carbohydrate metabolites such as dihydroxyacetone phosphate, glyceraldehydes-3-phosphate, and other three carbon compounds that can be produced after decarboxylation of erythritol and its derivatives.  While it has been hypothesized that erythritol may serve as a carbon source during growth of B. abortus, B. suis, and B. melitensis in the placenta of their natural hosts, an analysis of deletion mutants in these models has not been reported. However, the lower incidence of abortion in sheep flocks infected with B. ovis compared to B. melitensis correlates with the inability of B. ovis to use erythritol as a carbon source. Mutants in eryB and eryC have been described to have a limited ability to grow in macrophages [46]. This limitation may well contribute to the limited virulence of B. ovis.  Glucose and Galactose  Unlike B. melitensis, B. abortus and B. suis, B. ovis is unable to grow on glucose or galactose as a primary carbon source [40]. Analysis of genes involved in uptake and utilization of these carbon sources reveals that B. ovis gluP (BOV_A0172), encoding a glucose/galactose transporter [47] is a pseudogene. B. abortus gluP mutants have a reduced ability to persist in the spleens of mice [48], suggesting that the ability to utilize these carbon sources may be important for systemic persistence of the human pathogenic Brucella species. However B. suis also lacks GluP and is able to oxidize glucose and galactose, suggesting that additional functions are lacking in B. ovis that contribute to utilization of these carbon sources. Several predicted sugar ABC transporters (BOV_1299-BOV1301, BOV_A0278-BOV_A0282, BOV_A0645-BOV_A0648 and BOV_A1083-BOV_A1086) of unknown specificity contain pseudogenes, which may potentially reduce the ability of B. ovis to take up glucose and galactose.  Ribose  Two components, a permease and an ATP binding protein of a putative ribose ABC transport system (BOV_A0936-BOV_A0937) are pseudogenes in B. ovis, suggesting that the inability of B. ovis to utilize ribose as a sole carbon source may be the result of a reduced capacity to take up ribose from the growth medium. Similarly, a periplasmic binding protein and an ATP binding protein of a predicted ABC transporter for xylose (BOV_A1055-BOVA1056) contain frameshifts, which may underlie the inability of B. ovis to utilize xylose [40].  Oxidase phenotype  B. ovis is the only Brucella species with a negative oxidase phenotype. Oxidase phenotype depends on the activity of cytochrome C oxidase which in B. suis is encoded by at least 7 genes, four of them organized in one operon, BR0363-BR0360 (ccoNOQP), together with BR0467 (coxB), encoding cytochrome c oxidase, subunit II, BR0468 (coxA) encoding cytochrome c oxidase, subunit I and BR0472 (coxC) encoding cytochrome c oxidase, subunit III. In B. ovis, the operon ccoNOQP (BOV_0376-BOV_0379), encoding the cb type cytochrome c oxidase is well conserved, except the gene ccoO (BOV_0378), which contains a frameshift generated by deletion of an A near its 5′ end, is a pseudogene. The B. ovis coxB gene (BOV_0473) contains a frameshift that very probably inactivates the gene, while coxA (BOV_0474) differs only in two residues with the B. suis product. The last 6 amino acids of coxC (BOV_0478) are lost as result of a short deletion (56 bp) that fuses this product with the next, apparently unrelated Orf. A short repeated sequence (GGGGCGGC) at both ends of the deletion seems to be responsible for this rearrangement. These genomic differences may be responsible for the oxidase negative phenotype of B. ovis.  Nitrogen metabolism  Several genes encoded in the B. suis genome with inferred functions in nitrogen metabolism are not predicted to be functional in the B. ovis genome. The genes norB (BOV_A0225), encoding the large subunit of nitric oxide reductase, and nosX (BOV_A0256), a gene of unknown function in the operon encoding nitric oxide synthase, are pseudogenes in B. ovis. The third gene, narK (BOV_A0276), encoding a nitrite extrusion protein, is degenerate, as was found in the B. melitensis and B. abortus 2308 genomes [21]. Nitric oxide reductase is required for survival and persistence of B. suis in mice [49], suggesting that lack of this activity in B. ovis may contribute to its restricted tissue tropism and host range.  A locus that contributes to growth of E. coli on aspartate as a nitrogen source, xanthine dehydrogenase (BOV_0365-BOV_0367;  [50]) contains a pseudogene in B. ovis, suggesting a further defect in nitrogen metabolism. Further, this locus could function in salvage pathways for purine nucleotides, which could contribute to nitrogen metabolism. A correlation between a defective purine nucleotide salvage pathway and reduced ability of B. ovis to survive intracellularly would be consistent with the importance of purine biosynthetic pathways for full virulence of B. abortus and B. melitensis  [51], [52]. Further, a homolog of Sinorhizobium meliloti fixI (BOV_0373), encoding an cation pump involved in symbiotic nitrogen fixation [53], is inactivated by a point mutation in the B. ovis genome. As the function of the fixGHI genes in Brucella spp. has not been determined, the biological significance of this gene inactivation for B. ovis is currently unknown.  Host-pathogen interactions  Lipopolysaccharide  B. ovis is known to have a rough LPS phenotype, which given the critical role of O-antigen in pathogenicity of B. abortus, B. suis and B. melitensis, likely contributes to its reduced pathogenicity for laboratory animals compared to other Brucella spp. [8], [54], [55]. As mentioned above, the wboA gene is missing from B. ovis, as well as a second, genetically linked glycosyltransferase. Pseudogenes with a possible function in LPS biosynthesis include a glycosyltransferase (BOV_A0475), an LpxA family acetyltransferase (BOV_A0367) and a putative undecaprenylphosphate alpha-N-acetylglucosamine transferase (BOV_A0371) of which the latter may also be involved in murein biosynthesis. While it is known that B. ovis LPS has a higher affinity for antimicrobial peptides than that of B. abortus, it is unknown whether differences in LPS structure compared to smooth Brucella species affect the interaction of B. ovis LPS with toll-like receptors of the innate immune system [56], [57].  Type IV secretion system (T4SS)  The T4SS, encoded by virB1-virB12, is an essential virulence factor in B. abortus, B. suis, and B. melitensis  [48], [58]–[60]. The genes virB1-VirB12 are intact in the B. ovis genome, suggesting that this system is functional. Further, the gene encoding its transcriptional activator VjbR (BOVA_0110;  [61]) is conserved. These findings are consistent with the detection of VirB5 and VirB8 expression in B. ovis  [62]. Two co-regulated genes identified as encoding T4SS substrates, vceA (BOV_1577) and vceC (BOV_1003) are present in B. ovis, however it is currently unknown whether there may be additional T4SS effectors in other Brucella spp. that are absent from B. ovis  [63]. A recent report showing that B. ovis strain PA is able to replicate in macrophages and HeLa cells at a rate similar to that of B. abortus suggests that its T4SS is functional [64].  Autotransporter proteins  Four predicted autotransporters have been identified in the sequenced Brucella genomes. Each of the sequenced Brucella genomes is predicted to encode a different combination of autotransporters [21], suggesting that none of these four proteins is essential for virulence, but that different combinations of autotransporters may contribute to observed differences in tissue tropism and host preference. The B. ovis genome is predicted to encode three functional autotransporters, corresponding to B. suis BR0072, BRA0173 and BRA1148, (BOV_0071, BOV_A0152 and BOV_A1053) while the fourth gene, BOV_1937, corresponding to BR2013, is degenerate. These proteins show a range in similarity (at the amino acid level) to their B. suis counterparts, from 99% between BRA1148 and BOV_A1053, to 86% similarity between BOV_A0152 and BRA0173. BR2013, designated omaA, is a pseudogene in both B. abortus and B. melitensis, and was noted to have a polymorphism with unknown functional effects in the genome of vaccine strain B. abortus 19 [65]. Since the product of this gene has been shown to contribute to persistence of B. suis in mice [66], it is possible that lack of a functional OmaA autotransporter in B. ovis may contribute to its limited tissue tropism and host range. However, the finding that all four autotransporter genes are predicted to be pseudogenes in B. melitensis, shows that they are not absolutely required for infectivity and transmission.  Immunomodulatory functions  In addition to the T4SS, several genes implicated in modulation of the immune response by Brucella spp., are well-conserved in B. ovis ATCC25840. These include btp1, encoding the TIR domain protein, an inhibitor of TLR2 signaling, the B cell mitogen encoded by prpA, and cyclic β-glucan synthase [67]–[70].  Outer membrane proteins  The two component regulator BvrR/BvrS, which has been shown to be a master regulator of many virulence-associated functions [71], [72], appears intact in B. ovis. However, a putative envZ osmosensor (BOV_A0412) is a pseudogene. Two genes shown to encode outer membrane proteins in other Brucella species omp2a (BOV_0632  [73]) and omp31 (BOV_1565; [74]), contain point mutations in B. ovis. For Omp31, the point mutation is predicted to lead to a truncation in the protein. It was found previously that the outer membrane of B. ovis is more susceptible to cationic peptides than a rough B. abortus mutant [56], suggesting that together with the defects in LPS biosynthesis discussed above, these defects in outer membrane components may further compromise the cell envelope stability of B. ovis making it less able to survive environmental stresses.  Perspective  The unique biology of Brucella ovis compared to the human pathogenic species appears to be in part the result of genome degradation. Worldwide, the majority of human brucellosis cases occur via ingestion of contaminated dairy products. B. ovis is not known to cause human infection, despite worldwide consumption of unpasteurized sheep's milk, where B. ovis has been detected [38]. Oral transmission, although feasible in experimental conditions, does not appear to be one of the main routes of infection for B. ovis, whereas passive venereal transmission via the ewe is the most important one [75]. This suggests that this species has lost the ability to infect via the oral route. One genomic change that may contribute to this loss of oral infectivity is the loss of an important virulence factor, urease, that is required for survival of stomach acidity by Brucella spp [36], [37]. Urease has also been shown to contribute to the establishment of Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae infection in pigs through the respiratory tract [76]. If this mechanism is also operative in Brucella spp., then it is possible that B. ovis is also deficient in establishing infections not only by the digestive route but also via aerosol inhalation, which are the two main routes of infection by human pathogenic Brucella spp. Additional genes that seem to be non-functional in B. ovis could also contribute to reduce the number of transmission routes compared to other Brucella species. A characteristic of B. ovis is its tropism for the ovine male genital tract, which presents as epididymo-orchitis [8]. Since other Brucella species, especially B. melitensis are known to cause epididymo-orchitis in human patients [77], the predilection of B. ovis to cause epididymo-orchitis in rams likely represents a loss of functions required to target to other tissues. However, due to the large number of genes in the B. ovis genome with unknown function, a gain of functions that allow for increased colonization of the male genital tract cannot be ruled out based on the genome sequence.

PMC3387794,Abstract,Abstract,CP003096,0,0,1,,,"  Thermovirga lienii Dahle and Birkeland 2006 is a member of the genus Thermovirga in the genomically moderately well characterized phylum 'Synergistetes'. Members of this relatively recently proposed phylum ‘Synergistetes’ are of interest because of their isolated phylogenetic position and their diverse habitats, e.g. from humans to oil wells. The genome of T. lienii Cas60314T is the fifth genome sequence (third completed) from this phylum to be published. Here we describe the features of this organism, together with the complete genome sequence and annotation. The 1,999,646 bp long genome (including one plasmid) with its 1,914 protein-coding and 59 RNA genes is a part of the  Genomic   Encyclopedia of   Bacteria and   Archaea  project.  ",FALSE,FALSE,

PMC3387794,Classification and features,Other,CP003096,0,0,1,,Doesn't look like they do anything with this genome here except describe it,"  Classification and features  A representative genomic 16S rRNA sequence of T. lienii Cas60314T was compared using NCBI BLAST [2,3] under default settings (e.g., considering only the high-scoring segment pairs (HSPs) from the best 250 hits) with the most recent release of the Greengenes database [4] and the relative frequencies of taxa and keywords (reduced to their stem [5]) were determined, weighted by BLAST scores. The most frequently occurring genera were Dethiosulfovibrio (45.6%), Thermanaerovibrio (30.2%), Aminobacterium (12.5%) and Thermovirga (11.7%) (16 hits in total). Regarding the single hit to sequences from members of the species, the average identity within HSPs was 100.0%, whereas the average coverage by HSPs was 92.2%. Among all other species, the one yielding the highest score was Thermanaerovibrio velox (FR733707), which corresponded to an identity of 90.1% and an HSP coverage of 85.5%. (Note that the Greengenes database uses the INSDC (= EMBL/NCBI/DDBJ) annotation, which is not an authoritative source for nomenclature or classification.) The highest-scoring environmental sequence was HM041945 ('aggregate-forming and crude-oil-adhering microbial biodegraded -temperature petroleum reservoir produced fluid Niiboli oilfield clone NRB28'), which showed an identity of 99.7% and an HSP coverage of 98.3%. The most frequently occurring keywords within the labels of all environmental samples which yielded hits were 'digest' (10.9%), 'anaerob' (7.4%), 'sludg' (5.8%), 'mesophil' (5.6%) and 'wastewat' (5.6%) (234 hits in total). The most frequently occurring keywords within the labels of those environmental samples which yielded hits of a higher score than the highest scoring species were 'microbi' (6.3%), 'temperatur' (4.4%), 'oil' (3.6%), 'water' (3.6%) and 'anaerob' (3.2%) (43 hits in total). Although these keywords are not in conflict with the habitat from which strain Cas60314T was isolated, they do not reveal new insights into the largely unknown natural habitat for members of the species.  Figure 1 shows the phylogenetic neighborhood of T. lienii in a 16S rRNA based tree. The sequences of the three 16S rRNA gene copies in the genome differ from each other by up to three nucleotides, and differ by up to three nucleotides from the previously published 16S rRNA sequence (DQ071273)  Figure 1  Phylogenetic tree highlighting the position of T. lienii relative to the type strains of the other species within the phylum Synergistetes. The tree was inferred from 1,385 aligned characters [6,7] of the 16S rRNA gene sequence under the maximum likelihood (ML) criterion [8]. Rooting was done initially using the midpoint method [9] and then checked for its agreement with the current classification (Table 1). The branches are scaled in terms of the expected number of substitutions per site. Numbers adjacent to the branches are support values from 1,000 ML bootstrap replicates [10] (left) and from 1,000 maximum parsimony bootstrap replicates [11] (right) if larger than 60%.

Cells of T. lienii Cas60314T are Gram-negative staining, motile (only in the early exponential growth phase), straight rods of 0.4 to 0.8 μm diameter and 2 to 3 μm length (Figure 2) [1]. Cells appeared to be singly, or in chains of 2 to 5 cells, but can also form aggregates of several hundred cells [1]. The growth range of strain Cas60314T spans from 37-68°C, with an optimum at 58°C, and pH 6.2-8.5, with an optimum at 6.5-7 [1]. Strain Cas60314T grow best in medium containing 2-3% NaCl [1]. Physiological characteristics such as growth substrates and products formed are described in great detail by Dahle and Birkeland [1]; the organism has a fermentative metabolism and utilizes amino acids, proteinaceous substrates and selected organic acids, but no sugars, fatty acids or alcohols [1]. Strain Cas60314T reduces cysteine and elemental sulfur to sulfide, but not thiosulfate [1]. The strain could not grow in unreduced medium under an N2/air (20:1, v/v) gas phase, but was able to grow with 100% H2 in the headspace, with peptone as substrate [1].

DNA was isolated from 0.5-1 g of cell paste using MasterPure Gram-positive DNA purification kit (Epicentre MGP04100) following the standard protocol as recommended by the manufacturer, with the following modification for cell lysis: 1µl lysozyme and 5 µl mutanolysin added to the standard lysis solution for 40 min at 37°C; after the MPC-step the lysis solution was incubated for one hour on ice. DNA is available through the DNA Bank Network [25].  Genome sequencing and assembly  The genome was sequenced using a combination of Illumina and 454 sequencing platforms. All general aspects of library construction and sequencing can be found at the JGI website [26]. Pyrosequencing reads were assembled using the Newbler assembler (Roche). The initial Newbler assembly consisting of 127 contigs in one scaffold was converted into a phrap [27] assembly by making fake reads from the consensus, to collect the read pairs in the 454 paired end library. Illumina GAii sequencing data (379.0 Mb) was assembled with Velvet [28] and the consensus sequences were shredded into 1.5 kb overlapped fake reads and assembled together with the 454 data. The 454 draft assembly was based on 156.8 Mb 454 draft data and all of the 454 paired end data. Newbler parameters are -consed -a 50 -l 350 -g -m -ml 20. The Phred/Phrap/Consed software package [27] was used for sequence assembly and quality assessment in the subsequent finishing process. After the shotgun stage, reads were assembled with parallel phrap (High Performance Software, LLC). Possible mis-assemblies were corrected with gapResolution [26], Dupfinisher [29], or sequencing cloned bridging PCR fragments with subcloning. Gaps between contigs were closed by editing in Consed, by PCR and by Bubble PCR primer walks (J.-F. Chang, unpublished). A total of 811 additional reactions and 23 shatter libraries were necessary to close gaps and to raise the quality of the finished sequence. Illumina reads were also used to correct potential base errors and increase consensus quality using a software Polisher developed at JGI [30]. The error rate of the completed genome sequence is less than 1 in 100,000. Together, the combination of the Illumina and 454 sequencing platforms provided 302.7 × coverage of the genome. The final assembly contained 569,599 pyrosequence and 12,441,8 Illumina reads.  Genome annotation  Genes were identified using Prodigal [31] as part of the Oak Ridge National Laboratory genome annotation pipeline, followed by a round of manual curation using the JGI GenePRIMP pipeline [32]. The predicted CDSs were translated and used to search the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) non-redundant database, UniProt, TIGRFam, Pfam, PRIAM, KEGG, COG, and InterPro databases. These data sources were combined to assert a product description for each predicted protein. Non-coding genes and miscellaneous features were predicted using tRNAscan-SE [33], RNAMMer [34], Rfam [35], TMHMM [36], and signalP [37].  ",TRUE,TRUE,
PMC3387794,Introduction,Introduction,CP003096,0,0,1,,,"  Introduction  Strain Cas60314T (= DSM 17291 = ATCC BA-1197) is the type strain of the species Thermovirga lienii [1] of the monospecific genus Thermovirga [1]. The strain was originally isolated from 68°C hot oil-well production water from an oil reservoir in the North Sea (Norway) [1]. The genus name Thermovirga was derived from the Greek word for thermê, heat, and the Latin word virga, rod, meaning the hot rod [1]; the species epithet was derived of Lien, in honor of the Norwegian microbiologist Professor Torleiv Lien, for his important contribution in the study of anaerobes from petroleum reservoirs [1]. Whether or not strain Cas60314T occurs naturally in the oil reservoir is not clear, but is likely because the oil well was not injected with seawater (which eliminates a common source of contamination) [1]. Here we present a summary classification and a set of features for T. lienii Cas60314T, together with the description of the genomic sequencing and annotation.  ",FALSE,TRUE,

PMC3387794,Classification and features,Other,CP003097,0,0,1,,,"  Classification and features  A representative genomic 16S rRNA sequence of T. lienii Cas60314T was compared using NCBI BLAST [2,3] under default settings (e.g., considering only the high-scoring segment pairs (HSPs) from the best 250 hits) with the most recent release of the Greengenes database [4] and the relative frequencies of taxa and keywords (reduced to their stem [5]) were determined, weighted by BLAST scores. The most frequently occurring genera were Dethiosulfovibrio (45.6%), Thermanaerovibrio (30.2%), Aminobacterium (12.5%) and Thermovirga (11.7%) (16 hits in total). Regarding the single hit to sequences from members of the species, the average identity within HSPs was 100.0%, whereas the average coverage by HSPs was 92.2%. Among all other species, the one yielding the highest score was Thermanaerovibrio velox (FR733707), which corresponded to an identity of 90.1% and an HSP coverage of 85.5%. (Note that the Greengenes database uses the INSDC (= EMBL/NCBI/DDBJ) annotation, which is not an authoritative source for nomenclature or classification.) The highest-scoring environmental sequence was HM041945 ('aggregate-forming and crude-oil-adhering microbial biodegraded -temperature petroleum reservoir produced fluid Niiboli oilfield clone NRB28'), which showed an identity of 99.7% and an HSP coverage of 98.3%. The most frequently occurring keywords within the labels of all environmental samples which yielded hits were 'digest' (10.9%), 'anaerob' (7.4%), 'sludg' (5.8%), 'mesophil' (5.6%) and 'wastewat' (5.6%) (234 hits in total). The most frequently occurring keywords within the labels of those environmental samples which yielded hits of a higher score than the highest scoring species were 'microbi' (6.3%), 'temperatur' (4.4%), 'oil' (3.6%), 'water' (3.6%) and 'anaerob' (3.2%) (43 hits in total). Although these keywords are not in conflict with the habitat from which strain Cas60314T was isolated, they do not reveal new insights into the largely unknown natural habitat for members of the species.  Figure 1 shows the phylogenetic neighborhood of T. lienii in a 16S rRNA based tree. The sequences of the three 16S rRNA gene copies in the genome differ from each other by up to three nucleotides, and differ by up to three nucleotides from the previously published 16S rRNA sequence (DQ071273)  Figure 1  Phylogenetic tree highlighting the position of T. lienii relative to the type strains of the other species within the phylum Synergistetes. The tree was inferred from 1,385 aligned characters [6,7] of the 16S rRNA gene sequence under the maximum likelihood (ML) criterion [8]. Rooting was done initially using the midpoint method [9] and then checked for its agreement with the current classification (Table 1). The branches are scaled in terms of the expected number of substitutions per site. Numbers adjacent to the branches are support values from 1,000 ML bootstrap replicates [10] (left) and from 1,000 maximum parsimony bootstrap replicates [11] (right) if larger than 60%. Lineages with type strain genome sequencing projects registered in GOLD [12] are labeled with one asterisk, those also listed as 'Complete and Published' with two asterisks [13,14]. Dethiosulfovibrio peptidovorans [15] and Aminomonas paucivorans [16] are without a second asterisk, because these publications were based on 'non-complete' permanent draft sequences.

Cells of T. lienii Cas60314T are Gram-negative staining, motile (only in the early exponential growth phase), straight rods of 0.4 to 0.8 μm diameter and 2 to 3 μm length (Figure 2) [1]. Cells appeared to be singly, or in chains of 2 to 5 cells, but can also form aggregates of several hundred cells [1]. The growth range of strain Cas60314T spans from 37-68°C, with an optimum at 58°C, and pH 6.2-8.5, with an optimum at 6.5-7 [1]. Strain Cas60314T grow best in medium containing 2-3% NaCl [1]. Physiological characteristics such as growth substrates and products formed are described in great detail by Dahle and Birkeland [1]; the organism has a fermentative metabolism and utilizes amino acids, proteinaceous substrates and selected organic acids, but no sugars, fatty acids or alcohols [1]. Strain Cas60314T reduces cysteine and elemental sulfur to sulfide, but not thiosulfate [1]. The strain could not grow in unreduced medium under an N2/air (20:1, v/v) gas phase, but was able to grow with 100% H2 in the headspace, with peptone as substrate [1].

DNA was isolated from 0.5-1 g of cell paste using MasterPure Gram-positive DNA purification kit (Epicentre MGP04100) following the standard protocol as recommended by the manufacturer, with the following modification for cell lysis: 1µl lysozyme and 5 µl mutanolysin added to the standard lysis solution for 40 min at 37°C; after the MPC-step the lysis solution was incubated for one hour on ice. DNA is available through the DNA Bank Network [25].  Genome sequencing and assembly  The genome was sequenced using a combination of Illumina and 454 sequencing platforms. All general aspects of library construction and sequencing can be found at the JGI website [26]. Pyrosequencing reads were assembled using the Newbler assembler (Roche). The initial Newbler assembly consisting of 127 contigs in one scaffold was converted into a phrap [27] assembly by making fake reads from the consensus, to collect the read pairs in the 454 paired end library. Illumina GAii sequencing data (379.0 Mb) was assembled with Velvet [28] and the consensus sequences were shredded into 1.5 kb overlapped fake reads and assembled together with the 454 data. The 454 draft assembly was based on 156.8 Mb 454 draft data and all of the 454 paired end data. Newbler parameters are -consed -a 50 -l 350 -g -m -ml 20. The Phred/Phrap/Consed software package [27] was used for sequence assembly and quality assessment in the subsequent finishing process. After the shotgun stage, reads were assembled with parallel phrap (High Performance Software, LLC). Possible mis-assemblies were corrected with gapResolution [26], Dupfinisher [29], or sequencing cloned bridging PCR fragments with subcloning. Gaps between contigs were closed by editing in Consed, by PCR and by Bubble PCR primer walks (J.-F. Chang, unpublished). A total of 811 additional reactions and 23 shatter libraries were necessary to close gaps and to raise the quality of the finished sequence. Illumina reads were also used to correct potential base errors and increase consensus quality using a software Polisher developed at JGI [30]. The error rate of the completed genome sequence is less than 1 in 100,000. Together, the combination of the Illumina and 454 sequencing platforms provided 302.7 × coverage of the genome. The final assembly contained 569,599 pyrosequence and 12,441,8 Illumina reads.  Genome annotation  Genes were identified using Prodigal [31] as part of the Oak Ridge National Laboratory genome annotation pipeline, followed by a round of manual curation using the JGI GenePRIMP pipeline [32]. The predicted CDSs were translated and used to search the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) non-redundant database, UniProt, TIGRFam, Pfam, PRIAM, KEGG, COG, and InterPro databases. These data sources were combined to assert a product description for each predicted protein. Non-coding genes and miscellaneous features were predicted using tRNAscan-SE [33], RNAMMer [34], Rfam [35], TMHMM [36], and signalP [37].  ",TRUE,TRUE,
PMC3387794,Introduction,Introduction,CP003097,0,0,1,,,"  Introduction  Strain Cas60314T (= DSM 17291 = ATCC BA-1197) is the type strain of the species Thermovirga lienii [1] of the monospecific genus Thermovirga [1]. The strain was originally isolated from 68°C hot oil-well production water from an oil reservoir in the North Sea (Norway) [1]. The genus name Thermovirga was derived from the Greek word for thermê, heat, and the Latin word virga, rod, meaning the hot rod [1]; the species epithet was derived of Lien, in honor of the Norwegian microbiologist Professor Torleiv Lien, for his important contribution in the study of anaerobes from petroleum reservoirs [1]. Whether or not strain Cas60314T occurs naturally in the oil reservoir is not clear, but is likely because the oil well was not injected with seawater (which eliminates a common source of contamination) [1]. Here we present a summary classification and a set of features for T. lienii Cas60314T, together with the description of the genomic sequencing and annotation.  ",FALSE,TRUE,

Members of this relatively recently proposed phylum ‘Synergistetes’ are of interest because of their isolated phylogenetic position and their diverse habitats, e.g. from humans to oil wells. The genome of T. lienii Cas60314T is the fifth genome sequence (third completed) from this phylum to be published. Here we describe the features of this organism, together with the complete genome sequence and annotation. The 1,999,646 bp long genome (including one plasmid) with its 1,914 protein-coding and 59 RNA genes is a part of the  Genomic   Encyclopedia of   Bacteria and   Archaea  project.  ",FALSE,FALSE,

PMC3387794,Classification and features,Other,Gc02016,0,0,1,,,"  Classification and features  A representative genomic 16S rRNA sequence of T. lienii Cas60314T was compared using NCBI BLAST [2,3] under default settings (e.g., considering only the high-scoring segment pairs (HSPs) from the best 250 hits) with the most recent release of the Greengenes database [4] and the relative frequencies of taxa and keywords (reduced to their stem [5]) were determined, weighted by BLAST scores. The most frequently occurring genera were Dethiosulfovibrio (45.6%), Thermanaerovibrio (30.2%), Aminobacterium (12.5%) and Thermovirga (11.7%) (16 hits in total). Regarding the single hit to sequences from members of the species, the average identity within HSPs was 100.0%, whereas the average coverage by HSPs was 92.2%. Among all other species, the one yielding the highest score was Thermanaerovibrio velox (FR733707), which corresponded to an identity of 90.1% and an HSP coverage of 85.5%. (Note that the Greengenes database uses the INSDC (= EMBL/NCBI/DDBJ) annotation, which is not an authoritative source for nomenclature or classification.) The highest-scoring environmental sequence was HM041945 ('aggregate-forming and crude-oil-adhering microbial biodegraded -temperature petroleum reservoir produced fluid Niiboli oilfield clone NRB28'), which showed an identity of 99.7% and an HSP coverage of 98.3%. The most frequently occurring keywords within the labels of all environmental samples which yielded hits were 'digest' (10.9%), 'anaerob' (7.4%), 'sludg' (5.8%), 'mesophil' (5.6%) and 'wastewat' (5.6%) (234 hits in total). The most frequently occurring keywords within the labels of those environmental samples which yielded hits of a higher score than the highest scoring species were 'microbi' (6.3%), 'temperatur' (4.4%), 'oil' (3.6%), 'water' (3.6%) and 'anaerob' (3.2%) (43 hits in total). Although these keywords are not in conflict with the habitat from which strain Cas60314T was isolated, they do not reveal new insights into the largely unknown natural habitat for members of the species.  Figure 1 shows the phylogenetic neighborhood of T. lienii in a 16S rRNA based tree. The sequences of the three 16S rRNA gene copies in the genome differ from each other by up to three nucleotides, and differ by up to three nucleotides from the previously published 16S rRNA sequence (DQ071273)  Figure 1  Phylogenetic tree highlighting the position of T. lienii relative to the type strains of the other species within the phylum Synergistetes. The tree was inferred from 1,385 aligned characters [6,7] of the 16S rRNA gene sequence under the maximum likelihood (ML) criterion [8]. Rooting was done initially using the midpoint method [9] and then checked for its agreement with the current classification (Table 1). The branches are scaled in terms of the expected number of substitutions per site. Numbers adjacent to the branches are support values from 1,000 ML bootstrap replicates [10] (left) and from 1,000 maximum parsimony bootstrap replicates [11] (right) if larger than 60%.

If the evidence code is IDA, then the property was directly observed for a living isolate by one of the authors or an expert mentioned in the acknowledgements.  Cells of T. lienii Cas60314T are Gram-negative staining, motile (only in the early exponential growth phase), straight rods of 0.4 to 0.8 μm diameter and 2 to 3 μm length (Figure 2) [1]. Cells appeared to be singly, or in chains of 2 to 5 cells, but can also form aggregates of several hundred cells [1]. The growth range of strain Cas60314T spans from 37-68°C, with an optimum at 58°C, and pH 6.2-8.5, with an optimum at 6.5-7 [1]. Strain Cas60314T grow best in medium containing 2-3% NaCl [1]. Physiological characteristics such as growth substrates and products formed are described in great detail by Dahle and Birkeland [1]; the organism has a fermentative metabolism and utilizes amino acids, proteinaceous substrates and selected organic acids, but no sugars, fatty acids or alcohols [1]. Strain Cas60314T reduces cysteine and elemental sulfur to sulfide, but not thiosulfate [1]. The strain could not grow in unreduced medium under an N2/air (20:1, v/v) gas phase, but was able to grow with 100% H2 in the headspace, with peptone as substrate [1].

DNA was isolated from 0.5-1 g of cell paste using MasterPure Gram-positive DNA purification kit (Epicentre MGP04100) following the standard protocol as recommended by the manufacturer, with the following modification for cell lysis: 1µl lysozyme and 5 µl mutanolysin added to the standard lysis solution for 40 min at 37°C; after the MPC-step the lysis solution was incubated for one hour on ice. DNA is available through the DNA Bank Network [25].  Genome sequencing and assembly  The genome was sequenced using a combination of Illumina and 454 sequencing platforms. All general aspects of library construction and sequencing can be found at the JGI website [26]. Pyrosequencing reads were assembled using the Newbler assembler (Roche). The initial Newbler assembly consisting of 127 contigs in one scaffold was converted into a phrap [27] assembly by making fake reads from the consensus, to collect the read pairs in the 454 paired end library. Illumina GAii sequencing data (379.0 Mb) was assembled with Velvet [28] and the consensus sequences were shredded into 1.5 kb overlapped fake reads and assembled together with the 454 data. The 454 draft assembly was based on 156.8 Mb 454 draft data and all of the 454 paired end data. Newbler parameters are -consed -a 50 -l 350 -g -m -ml 20. The Phred/Phrap/Consed software package [27] was used for sequence assembly and quality assessment in the subsequent finishing process. After the shotgun stage, reads were assembled with parallel phrap (High Performance Software, LLC). Possible mis-assemblies were corrected with gapResolution [26], Dupfinisher [29], or sequencing cloned bridging PCR fragments with subcloning. Gaps between contigs were closed by editing in Consed, by PCR and by Bubble PCR primer walks (J.-F. Chang, unpublished). A total of 811 additional reactions and 23 shatter libraries were necessary to close gaps and to raise the quality of the finished sequence. Illumina reads were also used to correct potential base errors and increase consensus quality using a software Polisher developed at JGI [30]. The error rate of the completed genome sequence is less than 1 in 100,000. Together, the combination of the Illumina and 454 sequencing platforms provided 302.7 × coverage of the genome. The final assembly contained 569,599 pyrosequence and 12,441,8 Illumina reads.  Genome annotation  Genes were identified using Prodigal [31] as part of the Oak Ridge National Laboratory genome annotation pipeline, followed by a round of manual curation using the JGI GenePRIMP pipeline [32]. The predicted CDSs were translated and used to search the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) non-redundant database, UniProt, TIGRFam, Pfam, PRIAM, KEGG, COG, and InterPro databases. These data sources were combined to assert a product description for each predicted protein. Non-coding genes and miscellaneous features were predicted using tRNAscan-SE [33], RNAMMer [34], Rfam [35], TMHMM [36], and signalP [37].  ",TRUE,TRUE,
PMC3387794,Introduction,Introduction,Gc02016,0,0,1,,,"  Introduction  Strain Cas60314T (= DSM 17291 = ATCC BA-1197) is the type strain of the species Thermovirga lienii [1] of the monospecific genus Thermovirga [1]. The strain was originally isolated from 68°C hot oil-well production water from an oil reservoir in the North Sea (Norway) [1]. The genus name Thermovirga was derived from the Greek word for thermê, heat, and the Latin word virga, rod, meaning the hot rod [1]; the species epithet was derived of Lien, in honor of the Norwegian microbiologist Professor Torleiv Lien, for his important contribution in the study of anaerobes from petroleum reservoirs [1]. Whether or not strain Cas60314T occurs naturally in the oil reservoir is not clear, but is likely because the oil well was not injected with seawater (which eliminates a common source of contamination) [1]. Here we present a summary classification and a set of features for T. lienii Cas60314T, together with the description of the genomic sequencing and annotation.  ",FALSE,TRUE,

In this study, we investigated the role of the two-component signal transduction system ArlRS in regulating S. epidermidis biofilm formation. An ArlRS-deficient mutant, WW06, was constructed using S. epidermidis strain 1457 as a parental strain. Although the growth curve of WW06 was similar to that of SE1457, the mutant strain was unable to form biofilms in vitro. In a rabbit subcutaneous infection model, sterile disks made of polymeric materials were implanted subcutaneously followed with inoculation of WW06 or SE1457. The viable bacteria cells of WW06 recovered from biofilms on the embedded disks were much lower than that of SE1457. Complementation of arlRS genes expression from plasmid in WW06 restored biofilm-forming phenotype both in vivo and in vitro. WW06 maintained the ability to undergo initial attachment. Transcription levels of several genes involved in biofilm formation, including icaADBC, sigB, and sarA, were decreased in WW06, compared to SE1457; and icaR expression was increased in WW06, detected by real-time reverse-transcription PCR. The biofilm-forming phenotype was restored by overexpressing icaADBC in WW06 but not by overexpressing sigB, indicating that ArlRS regulates biofilm formation through the regulation of icaADBC. Gel shift assay showed that ArlR can bind to the promoter region of the ica operon. In conclusion, ArlRS regulates S. epidermidis biofilm formation in an ica-dependent manner, distinct from its role in S. aureus.  ",FALSE,FALSE,

It appears ArlRS is involved in different mechanisms that regulate biofilm formation in the closely related species.""","  Discussion  The two-component signal transductionsystem ArlRS is a global regulator of virulence genes in S. aureus  [19], modulating the extracellular proteolytic activity, capsule formation, biofilm formation and production of Protein A, α-toxin, β-hemolysin, lipase, coagulase and serine protease. However, the function of ArlRS in S. epidermidis was unclear. Thus, we investigated the role of ArlRS in S. epidermidis, an opportunistic pathogen that lacks many virulence genes [35] but can form biofilms as a major pathogenic factor. First, an ArlRS deficient mutant WW06 was constructed. WW06 showed dramatically decreased biofilms formation in vitro and in vivo. No obvious difference was found in either growth curves or initial attachment of WW06 and SE1457. Extracellular DNA has been reported to play an important role in biofilm formation [36]–[38]. In this study, however, the quantity of eDNA in the unwashed biofilms of the two strains was similar (data not shown), although the arlRS mutant strain WW06 exhibited a significantly higher autolysis rate than SE1457. Thus, we hypothesize that ArlRS modulates S. epidermidis biofilm formation by regulating the expression of the biofilm-related genes involved in the step of intercellular adhesion.  Many factors are involved in the second step of biofilm formation, e.g. polysaccharide intercellular adhesin (PIA) [39], accumulation associated protein (Aap) [40], [41], Extracellular matrix binding protein (Embp) [42], etc. The ica (intercellular adhesin) operon plays a crucial role by synthesizing PIA that is a main component of the extracellular polymeric substances (EPS). The ica operon is composed of the icaR (regulatory) gene and icaADBC (biosynthesis) genes. The icaR gene is located upstream of the icaADBC and is transcribed divergently, encoding a transcriptional repressor that negatively regulates icaADBC transcription in both S. aureus and S. epidermidis. Staphylococcal biofilms formation involves ica-dependent and ica-independent pathways [43]. In the present study, we have demonstrated that ArlRS activates icaADBC transcription, leading to PIA production and S. epidermidis biofilm formation. First, RT-qPCR analysis showed that icaADBC expression was significantly reduced in the ArlRS-deficient mutant WW06. Secondly, whereas semi-quantitative PIA detection revealed strong PIA production in the wild-type strain SE1457, little or no PIA expression was detected in WW06 mutant. Furthermore, complementation of icaADBC in WW06 restored its ability to form biofilms, whereas overexpression of arlRS in the icaC deletion mutant of SE1457 (ΔicaC) did not recover biofilm formation. Together, these results indicate that icaADBC is the downstream biofilm-related effector in the ArlRS regulation pathway. Moreover, EMSA demonstrated that recombinant ArlR binds to the 216-bp region located upstream of icaADBC. Overall, it reveals that ArlRS regulates S. epidermidis biofilm formation in an ica-dependent manner.  Previous studies have showed that ArlRS promotes biofilm formation in S. aureus strain ISP794 and strain 15981 which is capable of producing strong biofilms in TSB while unable to produce a biofilm in HHWm [18], [22]. Fournier, B. et, al. have found that an arlS gene transposition mutant (BF16) of S. aureus clinical strain ISP794 exhibited an increased ability to form biofilms on polymer surfaces, resulting from enhanced bacterial autolysis and altered peptidoglycan hydrolase activity. In the present study, arlRS mutation in S. epidermidis resulted in increased Triton X-100 induced bacterial autolysis, but decreased biofilm formation. The difference of altered biofilm formation between arlS mutant of S. aureus (BF16) and arlRS mutant of S. epidermidis (WW06) could be explained that due to different methods used for gene mutation (transposon insertion in the former and gene knockout in the latter), ArlR is absent in WW06 while present and may have function in BF16. Toledo-Arana, A. et, al. have reported that deletion of the arlRS locus in S. aureus clinical strain 15981 enhanced initial cell attachment and provoked accumulation of PNAG and biofilm formation when cultured in Hussain-Hastings-White-modified medium (HHWm). However, in HHWm the biofilm formation of the arlRS and icaADBC operon double mutant increased at the same level as the arlRS mutant, suggesting ArlRS is involved in early stage of strain 15981’s biofilm development in HHWm in an ica-independent manner. Interestingly, mutation of arlRS in S. epidermidis resulted in decreased biofilm formation in TSB in an ica-dependent manner. Bioinformatics analysis showed that arlR and arlS genes are conserved in S. epidermidis (over 95% nucleotide sequence identities among strains RP62A, SE1457 and ATCC12228) while S. epidermidis strain RP62A and S. aureus strain COL [44] share relatively high nucleotide sequence identities of arlR and arlS genes (74.8% and 70%, respectively). It appears ArlRS is involved in different mechanisms that regulate biofilm formation in the closely related species.  Current findings indicate that icaADBC expression in S. epidermidis is regulated by multiple regulatory factors including RsbU, SigB, IcaR, SarA and LuxS[8], [45]–[48]. Knobloch, J.K. et, al. reported that inactivation of rsbU gene (a positive regulator of sigB) in S. epidermidis was associated with both a reduction in PIA levels and biofilm formation, and the regulation of biofilm formation by rsbU is SigB dependent. Handke, L.D. et, al. reported that icaADBC transcription is down-regulated in the sigB mutant [45]. The regulation of icaADBC transcription by SigB was found to be mediated through the upregulation of IcaR expression. IcaR is a transcriptional repressor of icaADBC  [49]. The icaR gene deletion in S. epidermidis strain O-47 [50] led to increased PIA synthesis. In the present study, decreased transcription of rsbU, sigB and icaADBC, and increased icaR expression are observed in the arlRS mutant WW06, compared with SE1457. The results are consistent with the previous findings, indicating a potential mechanism that the regulation of icaADBC expression by ArlRS may be mediated by IcaR. The global transcriptional regulator SarA plays an important role in staphylococcal biofilm formation [8], [51]–[54]. Transcription of sarA was decreased by about 4.3 fold in the WW06 mutant, which is consistent with previous findings that SarA positively regulates ica operon expression in an icaR-independent manner; its role in ArlRS regulation pathway requires further investigation. As a quorum sensing system, LuxS repressed S. epidermidis biofilm formation through a cell-cell signaling mechanism based on autoinducer 2 secretions. LuxS affects biofilm formation by altering production of PIA via transcriptional regulation of the ica operon. In the present study, transcriptional levels of luxS in the SE1457 and WW06 were similar, indicating luxS may not play a role in the ArlRS regulation pathway in S. epidermidis.  Taken together, it reveals that in S. epidermidis, the ArlRS two-component signal transduction system is involved in the modulation of bacterial autolysis and in the regulation of biofilm formation an ica-dependent manner, which is distinct from the role of ArlRS in S. aureus and deserves further study.

PMC3407220,Introduction,Introduction,CP000029,0,0,0,,,"  Introduction  Staphylococcus epidermidis is an opportunistic pathogen that normally colonizes human skin and mucosal surfaces. Over the past two decades, S. epidermidis has emerged as a major pathogen of nosocomial infections, particularly infections involving indwelling medical device [1]–[3]. S. epidermidis pathogenesis is associated with its ability to colonize polymer surfaces to form multilayered biofilms, which impair the efficacy of antibiotic treatments and serve to protect the bacteria from the host immune system [4], [5].  Staphylococcal biofilm formation is a complicated process that is regulated by multiple regulatory factors including SigB, agr, SarA, and two-component signal transduction systems (TCSs) [6]–[10]. TCSs mediate a diverse range of adaptive responses to environmental stresses and play a vital role in bacterial pathogenesis [11]–[14]. In S. epidermidis, whereas the TCSs Agr, LytSR and SaeRS are known to be involved in biofilm formation [15]–[17], the role of the ArlRS TCS remains unclear.  10.1371/journal.pone.0040041.t001  Table 1  Plasmids and bacterial strains.

ArlRS strikingly modifies the extracellular proteolytic activity of S. aureus and is a regulator of virulence gene expression. Mutations in either arlR or arlS increase the production of Protein A, α-toxin, β-hemolysin, lipase, coagulase and serine protease. It was suggested that ArlRS may interact with both agr and sarA regulatory loci to modulate the virulence regulation network. A recent study found ArlRS positively regulate S. aureus capsule formation in a sigma B dependent manner [20]. Transcriptional profile analysis showed that in S. aureus, ArlRS positively regulated virulence factor genes such as sdrC, sdrD and sdrE, and functioned as a repressor of several toxin genes including lukD, lukE, phlC and hlgC  [21]. Furthermore, ArlRS was found to be involved in S. aureus biofilm formation. An arlS gene transposition mutant of S. aureus clinical strain MT23142 exhibited an increased ability to form biofilms on polymer surfaces, resulting from altered bacterial autolysis and peptidoglycan hydrolase activity [18]. Deletion of the arlRS locus in S. aureus clinical strain 15981 enhanced initial cell attachment and biofilm formation when cultured in Hussain-Hastings-White-modified medium (HHWm) [22].  Staphylococcal biofilm formation occurs in two steps: bacterial cells attach to the material surface; intercellular adhesion between bacterial cells forms multi-layered structures. In the second step, poly-N-acetylglucosamine (PNAG) in S. aureus or polysaccharide intercellular adhesin (PIA) in S. epidermidis synthesized by ica operon-encoded enzymes play a key role [5], [23].  10.1371/journal.pone.0040041.t002  Table 2  Primers used in this study.

This finding indicates ArlRS may be involved in S. aureus biofilm formation in an ica-independent manner [22].  Here, we demonstrate for the first time that the ArlRS plays an important role in the regulation of S. epidermidis biofilm formation, and acts in an ica-dependent manner distinct from the role of ArlRS in S. aureus biofilm formation.  10.1371/journal.pone.0040041.g001  Figure 1  Effect of ArlRS deficiency on S.epidermidis growth and biofilm formation in vitro.

Bacterial Strains, Plasmids and Growth Media  Bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in Table 1. B-Medium and Tryptic soy broth (TSB, Oxoid, Cambridge, UK) were used for S. epidermidis cultivation and biofilm formation. Media were supplemented with erythromycin (10 µg/ml), ampicillin (100 µg/ml), tetracycline (10 µg/ml) or chloramphenicol (10 µg/ml) when appropriate for purposes of selection.  10.1371/journal.pone.0040041.g003  Figure 3  Influence of ArlRS deficiency on viable S. epidermidis cells recovery from the implanted disks in the rabbit model.  Biofilms of SE1457, WW06 and ParlRS were formed in vivo on sterile polyethylene disks that were implanted subcutaneously in three New Zealand White female rabbits. Three days after infection, the implants were removed. Biofilms were scraped from the disks and CFUs of the viable bacteria recovered from the biofilms were determined and expressed as mean ± standard deviation. Asterisks denote statistically significant difference, P<0.001.  Construction of arlS Gene Knockout Mutant and Complementation Strains  The arlS gene in S. epidermidis SE1457 was deleted using the temperature-sensitive vector pBT2 [24]. Briefly, an erythromycin-resistance cassette (ermB) was inserted into the pBT2 plasmid. Then the regions flanking arlS gene were amplified by PCR and inserted into pBT2-ermB. Primers for PCR were designed according to the genomic sequence of S. epidermidis RP62A (GenBank accession number CP000029). Primer sequences are listed in Table 2. The recombinant plasmid, designated pBT2-arlS, was transformed by electroporation into S. aureus strain RN4220 then into SE1457. A procedure for allelic displacement of the arlS gene was performed as previous described [24], [25]. The mutant, designated WW06, was verified by PCR, RT-PCR and direct sequencing. Complementation studies were performed using a vector pCN51 [26] with a shine-dalgarno sequence plus either the arlS gene alone or arlRS genes. The resulting plasmids, pCN-arlS and pCN-arlRS, were transformed by electroporation into WW06, forming two complementary strains, ParlS and ParlRS, respectively.  10.1371/journal.pone.0040041.g004  Figure 4  Effect of arlRS mutation on S. epidermidis Triton X-100-induced autolysis.  SE1457, WW06, ParlRS and ΔatlE were cultured in TSB containing 1 M NaCl at 37°C to exponential phase (OD580 = 0.7). WW06 and ParlRS were also cultured in TSB containing 1 M NaCl and 2 µM CdCl2. Triton X-100 induced autolysis of the strains was determined by measuring the change in the value of OD595 at 30 min intervals; results are expressed as lysis percentages. Percent lysis was calculated as follows: [(OD0-ODat time t/OD0)] X 100%]. Experiments were carried out three times independently.  Expression of Recombinant ArlR (rArlR) and Preparation of the anti-rArlR Antiserum  The arlR gene was amplified from the genomic DNA of SE1457 and inserted into the vector pET-28a(+) to obtain the recombinant plasmid pET-arlR. The recombinant plasmid was then transformed into Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3). The expressed His-tagged ArlR protein was purified using the ProBond™ Purification System (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.  Five Balb/c mice were immunized with 5 μg purified rArlR coupled with aluminum hydroxide adjuvant by intraperitoneal injection, and boosted after four weeks. The antiserum was collected and anti-rArlR antibodies were detected with an immune dot-blot.  10.1371/journal.pone.0040041.g005  Figure 5  Regulation of expression of biofilm-related genes by ArlRS.  (A) Effect of ArlRS deficiency on transcription levels of the biofilm-related genes. Gene expression profiles of the arlRS-deficient strain WW06 and the wild-type parent strain SE1457 in the mid-log growth phase were analyzed using RT-qPCR. The experiment was performed in triplicate and the expression ratios of the biofilm-related genes in WW06 and SE1457 are represented as mean ± standard deviation. (B) Effect of arlRS mutation on PIA synthesis. PIA was extracted from cells grown for 24 h under biofilm conditions in 6-well cell culture plates. PIA was detected by dot blot analysis using wheat germ agglutinin coupled to horseradish peroxidase. The PIA-deficient S. epidermidis mutant ΔicaC was used as a negative control, and RP62A was used as a positive control.  10.1371/journal.pone.0040041.g006  Figure 6  Biofilm formation in complementation strains PicaADBC, icaCpRS and PsigB in 96-well microtiter plates.  (A) SE1457, WW06, ΔicaC and icaCpRS were cultivated in TSB; PicaADBC and PsigB were cultivated in TSB with or without 0.5% (g/ml) xylose. Biofilms formed over 24 h in 96-well microtiter plates were stained with 2% crystal violet. (B) The crystal violet was dissolved in ethanol and the absorbance was determined at 570 nm. The mean value ± standard deviation for each strain is shown.  Detection of ArlR Expression in SE1457 and WW06 by Western Blot  Overnight cultures of S. epidermidis strains SE1457 and WW06 were inoculated in 100 ml TSB and incubated at 37°C for 4 h. After centrifugation, pellets were washed three times with distilled water and resuspended in 2 ml phosphate buffered saline. After incubation with 100 µg lysostaphin at 37°C for 1 h, cells were ultrasonicated and centrifuged. Supernatants were assayed for total protein concentration by Bradford method. One microgram of bacterial cell extracts were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and then transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (GE-Whatman, Shanghai, China); purified rArlR (200 ng) was used as a control. Blots were probed with anti-rArlR antiserum (diluted 1∶1000) followed by horseradish peroxidase-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG (diluted 1∶2000) (Sangon, Shanghai, China). HRP activity was visualized via chemiluminescence detection using CSPD (Roche, Mannheim, Germany).  10.1371/journal.pone.0040041.g007  Figure 7  Binding of ArlR to the icaADBC promoter.  Lanes were loaded as follows: lane 1, 0.8 ng Dig-ICAP alone; lane 2, 0.8 ng Dig-ICAP and 2 µg rArlR; lanes 3–5, Dig-ICAP, rArlR and increasing amounts of unlabeled ICAP (12.5, 62.5,125 fold increase in Dig-ICAP, respectively); and lane 6, Dig-ICAP, rArlR and 100 ng of a 405 bp icaA fragment. The DIG-labeled DNA fragments were transferred to positively charged nylon membranes and visualized by an enzyme immunoassay using anti-Digoxigenin-AP, Fab-fragments and the chemiluminescent substrate CSPD. Chemiluminescent signals were recorded on X-ray film. DIG-ICAP, digoxin-labeled icaADBC promoter region; ICAP, unlabeled icaADBC promoter region; icaA’, icaA gene fragment.  Bacterial Initial Attachment Assay  The initial attachment ability of S. epidermidis cells was tested as described by Heilmann et al. [27].  Semi-quantitative Detection of Biofilms  S. epidermidis biofilm formation was detected as previously described [28]. Overnight bacterial cultures grown in TSB were diluted 1∶200, then transferred to 96-well polystyrene microtiter plates (200 µl per well). After incubation at 37°C for 24 h, wells were washed gently three times with PBS and stained with 2% crystal violet for 5 min. Next, the plate was rinsed under running tap water, air-dried, and ethanol was used to dissolve the crystal violet; finally, absorbance was determined at 570 nm.  10.1371/journal.pone.0040041.g008  Figure 8  Effect of ethanol or sodium chloride on biofilm formation of SE1457 and WW06.  (A) Semi-quantitative detection of biofilms formed by SE1457, WW06 in BM supplemented with 4% NaCl, 2% EtOH or 4% EtOH in 96-well polystyrene microtiter plates: The biofilms were stained with 2% crystal violet. (B) The crystal violet was dissolved in ethanol and the absorbance was determined at 570 nm. The mean value ± standard deviation for each strain is shown.  Scanning Electron Microscope Observations of Biofilms  Overnight cultures of S. epidermidis strains were diluted in 1∶200 in TSB and added in 96-well plates containing fragments of a central vein catheter (ABLE, Guangdong, China). After incubation at 37°C for 24 h, catheter fragments were washed and fixed with 2.5% glutaric dialdehyde (pH 7.4), followed by a secondary fixation with 1% osmium tetroxide. Catheter fragments were then washed twice with distilled water, dehydrated in 70%, 95% and 100% ethanol, dried, fixed onto cylindrical metal plates and gilded with an ion sputter (HCP-2, Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan). Catheter fragments were observed for biofilm formation using a scanning electron microscope (XL-30, Philips, Eindhoven, Netherlands). SEM micrographs were taken at ×3000 and ×10000 magnifications.  Biofilm Formation of the arlRS Mutant in vivo  Three New Zealand White female rabbits (2.0–2.5 kg) were anesthetized by intravascular injection with sodium pentobarbital (35 mg/kg of body weight). After the back of rabbit was denuded of fur, sterile polyethylene disks (1.0 cm diameter, 0.1 cm thickness, with 2 mm chimb) were implanted subcutaneously at four sites bilateral to the spine, as reported previously [29]–[31], three disks per site. About 108  S. epidermidis cells from overnight cultures of SE1457, WW06 and ParlRS were collected, resuspended in TSB and injected subcutaneously into different implantation site respectively, using fresh TSB as a negative control. Three days after, the rabbits were euthanized and the implants were removed. The biofilms were scraped from the disks and the viable bacteria (colony forming units, CFUs) were determined. Differences in log10 CFU counts among groups were assessed with one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) tests using software SPSS version 11.5 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).  Semi-quantitative Detection of Polysaccharide Intercellular Adhesin (PIA)  PIA detection was performed as previously described [32] using wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) as a surrogate for anti-PIA antibody, using an icaC deletion mutant of SE1457 as a PIA negative control, and strain RP62A as a PIA positive control. Overnight cultures of SE1457, WW06, RP62A and ΔicaC in TSB supplemented with 0.5% glucose were diluted to an OD578 of 0.07 with fresh media, added into sterile 6-well cell cultures plates (6 ml/well) (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark), and incubated at 37°C under static conditions. After 24 h incubation, cultures and the attached biofilms were transferred into 2 ml tubes and centrifuged. To prepare cell surface extracts for PIA detection, pellets were resuspended in 0.5 M ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, pH 8.0 (3 ml per gram wet weight), followed by heating at 100°C for 5 min. After centrifugation, 40 µl of the supernatant was mixed with 10 µl of proteinase K (20 mg/ml) and incubated at 37°C for 3 h, followed by heating at 100°C for 10 min. Different dilutions of the extracts were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, using a 96-well dot blot system (Biometra, Goettingen, Germany). Membranes were blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin and incubated with 2 µg/ml HRP-labeled wheat germ agglutinin (WGA-HRP conjugate, Lectinotest Laboratory, Ukraine) for 1 h. HRP activity was visualized by chromogenic detection using 4-Chloro-1-Naphthol.  Analysis of Transcriptional Levels of Biofilm-related Genes in WW06  To define the arlRS regulon, transcriptional levels of biofilm-related genes, icaADBC, icaR, rsbU, sigB, luxS and sarA, in the arlRS-deficient strain WW06 and the wild-type parent strain SE1457 were analyzed by RT-qPCR analysis using the ABI 7500 real-time PCR system. Gene-specific primers (Table 2) were designed to yield approximately 100 bp specific products; the housekeeping gene gyrB was used as an endogenous control. All samples were analyzed in triplicate and normalized against gyrB gene expression.  Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)  Interaction of the recombinant ArlR and the icaADBC promoter was analyzed by EMSA using the DIG Gel Shift Kit (Roche). rArlR was phosphorylated prior to gel shift reaction by incubating rArlR with 50 mM acetylphosphate for 1 h. The DNA fragment upstream icaADBC (ICAP, 216 bp) was amplified and linked with digoxin-labeled dd-UTP. The resulting DNA fragment, Dig-ICAP, was used for EMSA in native PAGE. Lanes 1–2 were loaded with 0.8 ng Dig-ICAP alone and 0.8 ng Dig-ICAP mixed with 2 µg rArlR, respectively. In lanes 3–5, increasing amounts of unlabeled ICAP (12.5, 62.5, 125 fold increase in the amount of Dig-ICAP in lane 2, respectively) was added as a specific competitor to the mixture of Dig-ICAP and rArlR. In lane 6, 100 ng of a 405 bp icaA fragment was added as a nonspecific competitor. Primers used for to amplify partial icaA gene and ICAP are listed in Table 2. The DNA fragments were transferred to positively charged nylon membranes (Roche) by electro-blotting and visualized by an enzyme immunoassay following the manufacturer’s instruction.  Cell Autolysis Assay  Autolysis assays for S. epidermidis strains were performed as previously described [33]. Strains SE1457, WW06, ParlRS and ΔatlE were cultured in TSB containing 1 M NaCl at 37°C to exponential phase (OD580 = 0.7). Additionally, WW06 and ParlRS were cultured in TSB containing 1 M NaCl and 2 µM CdCl2. Bacterial cells in 50 ml cultures were harvested by centrifugation, washed twice with ice-cold water and resuspended in 50 ml of 0.05 M Tris/HCl (pH 7.2) containing 0.05% (v/v) Triton X-100. Cells were then incubated at 30°C with shaking (200 rpm), and OD580 was measured at 30 min intervals.  10.1371/journal.pone.0040041.t001  Table 1  Plasmids and bacterial strains.

PMC3407220,Results,Results and Discussion,CP000029,0,0,0,,,"  Results  Construction of an arlRS Gene-deficient Mutant Strain of S. epidermidis  In S. epidermidis strain SE1457, the TCS arlRS consists of two genes, arlS and arlR, which share the same promoter and overlap by 4 bp. To investigate the function of arlRS in S. epidermidis biofilm formation, an ArlRS deficient mutant was constructed by replacing the arlS gene with an erythromycin-resistant cassette in the biofilm-forming SE1457 strain. The mutant was designated WW06. Western blot analysis of the whole cell extracts from WW06 using antiserum against the recombinant ArlR (rArlR, Figure S1) showed that no ArlR was expressed in WW06 (Figure S2). Thus, WW06 was an ArlRS-deficient mutant.  ArlRS Deficiency in S. epidermidis Abolishing Biofilm Formation in vitro  The impact of ArlRS mutation on biofilm formation was investigated using both polystyrene microtiter plates and intravenous catheters. In the microtiter plates, biofilm formation in WW06 was dramatically decreased (OD570 = 0.41±0.04), compared to its wild-type counterpart (OD570 = 3.06±0.47) (Figure 1 A, B). To rule out the possibility of a polar effect, two complementation strains, ParlS and ParlRS, were constructed using plasmids expressing arlS gene and arlRS genes respectively. While ParlRS partially restored biofilm-forming ability (OD570 = 1.84±0.08), the biofilm-forming ability of ParlS (OD570 = 0.45±0.02) was similar to that of WW06.  To further investigate the ability of S. epidermidis strains WW06, ParlS, ParlRS, and SE1457 to form biofilms, these strains were incubated with catheter fragments in 96-well plates at 37°C for 24 h and biofilm formation morphology was assessed by SEM. The wild-type strain SE1457 generated a compact, thick biofilm on the catheter surface, whereas the mutant WW06 formed only a few bacterial cell clusters. ParlRS formed a flat biofilm on the catheter, whereas ParlS formed only a small number of microcolonies similar to WW06 (Figure 2).  In terms of bacterial growth, the growth curves of SE1457, WW06, ParlS and ParlRS were similar (Figure 1C). Additionally, in an assay measuring initial adherence, the numbers of attached cells of SE1457 and WW06 were 3.64×104/cm2 and 3.58×104/cm2, respectively, which showed that mutation of arlRS exhibited little effect on bacterial growth and primary attachment.  Influence of ArlRS Deficiency on S.epidermidis Biofilm Formation in vivo  To investigate the effect of ArlRS deficiency on S. epidermidis biofilm formation in vivo, a biofilm infected rabbit model was established. The biofilm formation of SE1457, WW06 and ParlRS on the implanted disks in vivo was observed under an optical microscope and evaluated by determination of viable cells recovered from biofilms. SE1457 formed much thicker biofilms than WW06 on the implanted disks. The log10CFU/disk number of viable cells recovered from the biofilms of the arlRS mutant WW06 was significantly lower than that of SE1457 (3.08±0.42 vs 4.97±0.11, P<0.001) (Figure 3). The log10 number of viable CFU in biofilm of the complementation strain ParlRS was partially restored, which is higher than that of WW06 (4.02±0.25 vs 3.08±0.42, P<0.001).  ArlRS Mutation Affecting Bacterial Autolysis  To investigate the effect of ArlRS on bacterial autolysis, SE1457, WW06 and ParlRS were incubated with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 2.5 h and the percent autolysis was calculated. The lytic percentage of WW06 reached 97.83%, which was significantly higher than the 55.38% lytic percentage for SE1457. The autolysis rate of ParlRS was similar to that of WW06 when cultured in media without cadmium chloride (CdCl2); however, when cultured with 2 µM CdCl2 to induce arlRS expression, the lytic percentage of ParlRS was similar to wild-type (Figure 4).  Transcriptional Analysis of Biofilm-related Genes in WW06  To define the arlRS regulon and the role of ArlRS in S. epidermidis biofilm formation, total RNAs from the arlRS-deficient strain WW06 and the wild-type parent strain SE1457 in mid-log growth phase (4 h) were extracted, and transcriptional levels of several biofilm-related genes, rsbU, sigB, sarA, icaR, luxS and icaA, were analyzed by RT-qPCR, using the housekeeping gene gyrB as an internal control. The time point was selected because arlRS transcription in SE1457 reached peak levels at 4 h [34].  Transcription of the biofilm-related genes rsbU, sigB, sarA and icaA in WW06 were found to be down-regulated 14.5 fold, 8.4 fold, 4.3 fold and 7.5 fold, as compared to SE1457, whereas icaR transcription was upregulated 2.4 fold and expression of the quorum sensing-related gene luxS was similar (Figure 5A).  ArlRS Involving in S. epidermidis Biofilm Formation in an ica-dependent Manner  In contrast to S. aureus, where the ArlRS TCSs has been implicated in ica-independent biofilm formation, RT-qPCR analysis of the ArlRS-deficient mutant of S. epidermidis showed down-regulation of icaADBC transcription. To determine whether the down-regulation of icaADBC expression in WW06 functionally impacted biofilm formation, PIA formation was examined. SE1457 and WW06 were grown under conditions favoring biofilm formation and PIA concentrations were analyzed by a semi-quantitative dot blot assay; using a non-biofilm forming strain ΔicaC as a negative control and strong biofilm producing strain RP62A as a positive control. As expected, no surface-located PIA was detected from either WW06 or ΔicaC, whereas large amount of PIA production was observed in both SE1457 and RP62A. PIA synthesis was restored in the complementation strain ParlRS (Figure 5B).  To confirm that ArlRS is an upstream regulator of ica-dependent biofilm formation in S. epidermidis, the arlRS mutant was complemented with icaADBC on a plasmid under the control of xylose inducible promoter (pTX-icaADBC). This complementation restored biofilm-forming ability. In the contrast, overexpressing arlRS in the ΔicaC mutant did not recover biofilm formation (Figure 6). Although transcription of the sigB gene was down-regulated in WW06, when the mutant was complemented with a plasmid-encoding sigB gene (pTX-sigB), no obvious differences in biofilm formation were observed (Figure 6).  As ArlR is a DNA binding protein, we hypothesized that ArlR may bind directly to the promoter region of icaADBC to modulate transcription of the operon. Thus, EMSA were performed with digoxin-labeled DNA directly upstream of icaADBC (ICAP, 216 bp) and recombinant ArlR (rArlR). As shown in Figure 7, rArlR bound to Dig-ICAP and formed a DNA-protein complex, shifting Dig-ICAP behind (lane 2) compared to Dig-ICAP alone (lane 1). When increasing amounts of unlabeled ICAP was added as a specific competitor, more free Dig-ICAP was observed (lanes 3–5), while when a nonspecific competitor, icaA fragments, were added, no Dig-ICAP was shifted back (lane 6). It indicated a potential mechanism for ArlRS regulation of ica expression.  To further investigate the role of IcaR in regulating WW06 biofilm formation, effect of ethanol or sodium chloride on biofilm production of WW06 and SE1457 was detected. Addition of 4% NaCl to BM media increased SE1457 biofilm formation (approximately 3.1 fold), while had no effect on that of WW06, shown in Figure 8. SE1457 showed enhanced biofilm production in BM media supplemented with either 2% or 4% ethanol (1.8 fold or 2.3 fold, respectively), whereas ethanol showed very limited effect on WW06 biofilm formation (1.3 fold −1.4 fold increase).  10.1371/journal.pone.0040041.g001  Figure 1  Effect of ArlRS deficiency on S.epidermidis growth and biofilm formation in vitro.

PMC4466345,Abstract,Abstract,FQ311469,0,0,0,,,"  Sporisorium scitamineum is a biotrophic fungus responsible for the sugarcane smut, a worldwide spread disease. This study provides the complete sequence of individual chromosomes of S. scitamineum from telomere to telomere achieved by a combination of PacBio long reads and Illumina short reads sequence data, as well as a draft sequence of a second fungal strain. Comparative analysis to previous available sequences of another strain detected few polymorphisms among the three genomes. The novel complete sequence described herein allowed us to identify and annotate extended subtelomeric regions, repetitive elements and the mitochondrial DNA sequence. The genome comprises 19,979,571 bases, 6,677 genes encoding proteins, 111 tRNAs and 3 assembled copies of rDNA, out of our estimated number of copies as 130. Chromosomal reorganizations were detected when comparing to sequences of S. reilianum, the closest smut relative, potentially influenced by repeats of transposable elements. Repetitive elements may have also directed the linkage of the two mating-type loci. The fungal transcriptome profiling from in vitro and from interaction with sugarcane at two time points (early infection and whip emergence) revealed that 13.5% of the genes were differentially expressed in planta and particular to each developmental stage. Among them are plant cell wall degrading enzymes, proteases, lipases, chitin modification and lignin degradation enzymes, sugar transporters and transcriptional factors. The fungus also modulates transcription of genes related to surviving against reactive oxygen species and other toxic metabolites produced by the plant. Previously described effectors in smut/plant interactions were detected but some new candidates are proposed. Ten genomic islands harboring some of the candidate genes unique to S. scitamineum were expressed only in planta. RNAseq data was also used to reassure gene predictions.  ",FALSE,FALSE,

Comparisons of the three available genomes of S. scitamineum, the SSC39 and BSES strains determined in this work and the published sequence of the strain 2014001 [9] showed few polymorphisms. However, we uncovered new information by revealing repetitive elements, subtelomeric regions and the mitochondrial DNA sequence. We also analyzed the chromosomal arrangement in comparison with the genome of the closest related species S. reilianum. Although, genomes of smut fungi are poor in repetitive elements compared to other fungi, the sequences associated with breaks in synteny between the two genomes revealed the presence of eroded transposable elements. We did not find complete copies of these elements. The genome of S. scitamineum is highly compact but similar to the genome sizes of other smut fungi [51] as well as to the gene predictions described for U. maydis, S. reilianum and U. hordei genomes that shows respective 6,675, 6,902 and 7,111 genes. Both the S. reilianum and U. maydis genomes were described as harboring 1% of transposable elements and S scitamineum harbors 1.24% in contrast to U. hordei that contains 3% of such elements [8].  We defined the location and number of rDNA repeat copies and surprisingly, based on hybridizations, there is a significant variation in chromosome length containing the rDNA cluster between the two mating types of the same genetic background. It has been reported that the copy number of the rDNA genes can vary spontaneously before meiosis [52]. The significance of this difference remains to be studied in S. scitamineum.  Besides the hallmark of telomeric encoded helicases, the subtelomeric sequences harbor genes potentially associated with host adaptation and pathogenicity, a common characteristic among fungi [53, 54]. Although this has not been shown for smut, some of the genes identified were related to sexual cycle, differentiation, sporulation, and to toxin detoxification and resistance. Subtelomeric regions are prone to contain polymorphic regions within genomes of different strains since telomere and subtelomere repeated sequences might favor rearrangements [55, 56]. Investigation of these regions among isolates may offer a better understanding of genetic diversity within fungal populations. Genes encoding proteins of unknown function arranged in clusters were also found within the edges of subtelomeric regions. Some of these regions are indeed associated with host/parasite interactions with sugarcane, since transcriptomic data showed the expression of these genes only in planta.  mtDNA  The S. scitamineum mtDNA was determined to be comprised of 88,018 bp. The largest mitochondrial genome currently reported is from Rhizoctonia solani with 235,849 bp (NC_021436), which is in contrast to the relatively small mtDNA in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, with 19,431 bp (NC_001326). Among the Ustilagionomycotina reported mtDNAs sizes range from 29,999 bp (Jaminaea angkoriensis; KC628747.1) to 90,496 bp (Sporosorium reilanum; FQ311469.1). Very few mitochondrial genomes are available for members of the Ustiloginales (U. maydis, DQ157700.1; Melanopsichium pennsylvanicum, HG529787; and S. reilianum) and sizes range from 5,814 bp to 90,496 bp. Despite the size variation, the gene content among these genomes are very similar and size variability is mostly due to spacers and the presence or absence of introns and intron encoded ORFs [57–59].  The S. scitamineum mtDNA contains the 14 core protein coding genes found in all Basidiomycota mitochondrial genomes, encoding hydrophobic subunits of the electron transport chain, components of the ATPase synthase and the 40S ribosomal protein S3 [57]. RNA coding genes included the two ribosomal RNAs (rnl and rns), 22 tRNAs and the rnpB gene, which encodes the RNA component of the RNase P ribonucleoprotein involved in tRNA biogenesis.  Only group I introns were noted and these were located within the following genes: rnl, nad5, cob, nad1, atp9 and the intron-rich cox1 gene encompassing 11 ORF encoding introns. The 11 hypothetical genes (orphans that lack any counterparts in the NCBI database) identified by MFannot do not contain any introns. Mobile introns are characterized by their ability to “home” into cognate alleles that lack introns, therefore these elements tend to insert into conserved sequences which allows for more frequent lateral movement during crosses or during transient hyphal fusion among different species permiting cytoplasmic transfer [60]. The mobility is facilitated by the intron encoded proteins which are named homing endonucleases (HE) and in fungal mitochondrial genomes they can be assigned into two classes: LAGLIDADG and GIY YIG type HEases.  As stated earlier, several examples (atp9, cox1, nad1,nad5 and nad6) were noted in which C-terminus of a gene is duplicated and located downstream of the full length version. These types of duplications were observed for some genes in the mtDNA of Rhizoctonia solani[57]. It might be significant that we have noted that GIY-YIG type ORFs are located between the full length version of the gene and the partial duplicated version. These arrangements could be the result of a GIY-YIG HEG invading the 3’ terminus of a gene thereby displacing the C-terminus coding part of the resident gene. But as it has been seen previously, when freestanding homing endonuclease genes (HEGs) invade genes they can also mobilize a segment that essentially compensates/duplicates the displaced segment [60–62]. As HEGs appear to be neutral elements and thus are not subject to selection, they quickly accumulate mutations [63] and thus only a few detectable fragments can now be recorded. In general based on these partial gene duplications associated with GIY-YIG types ORFs and other eroded GIY-YIG ORFs noted in the intergenic spacers it appears HEase activity contributes towards mtDNA size and organization.  Mating-type analysis  Mating genes are crucial factors for disease establishment since a successful mating reaction is needed to form the infective dikaryotic hyphae. Both processes, mating and pathogenicity, are regulated by two loci: a and b[64]. The a  locus comprises genes encoding a pheromone-receptor system necessary for cell-cell recognition and hyphal fusion, whereas the b  locus comprises two genes encoding subunits of a heterodimeric homeodomain transcription factor regulating the maintenance of the dikaryon. Although considered to be phylogenetically close based on ITS and LSU rDNA analysis [65, 66], the two genera of smut fungi (Ustilago/Sporisorium) show high rates of amino acid substitution per site of the mating-type proteins. The trans-specific polymorphisms in pheromone and receptor genes are supposedly preserved since the last common ancestor of the basidiomycetes and ascomycetes and their reciprocal specificity likely have co-evolved [67]. Although the pheromone and receptor proteins differs among Ustilaginaceae species and seems to be optimized for intraspecific compatibility, interspecific sex up to the stage of plasmogamy can be still observed in vitro, which could have an evolutionary impact on speciation by hybridization events [67].  The genomic context of mating-type genes has been published for several smut fungi [9, 64, 67, 68]. The organization of the b  locus genes is conserved among species in opposition to what has been observed for the a  locus, even considering compatible mating-types with the same genetic background. S. scitamineum and S. reilianum differ from U. maydis and U. hordei by the presence of a second pheromone gene (mfa) in that locus. However, this extra copy (mfa 1.3) in S. scitamineum lacks the characteristic sequence acting as a signal for post-translational processing. The event involves the isoprenylation and carboxymethylation in the cysteine residue to form a secretable lipopeptide pheromone [69]. In U. maydis, a remnant of a pheromone gene is described for the a2 allele that cannot produce a functional product [67, 70]. Although mfa1.3 gene of S. scitamineum has full coverage of RNAseq reads, additional experiments are required to determine how many different mating-type alleles are in the fungal population and whether both pheromones are functional.  In S. reilianum and U. maydis, the mating-type loci are not linked and segregates independently (tetrapolar system) [68]; in U. hordei and S. scitamineum the a and b  loci are linked and segregate as one locus (bipolar system) [9, 71]. Here we present the first completely sequenced intergenic region between the two mating loci among the smut genotypes and the occurrence of transposable elements at this region. In U. hordei, that also has a bipolar mating system, the scaffold that holds the mating-type loci has large stretches of long terminal repeats (LTRs) and transposable elements (TEs) dispersed within an intervening region of about 500 kbp [71]. This region may have been responsible for the evolutionary process that resulted in the fusion of these mating-type loci and the divergence in these chromosomal segments that have led to a suppression of recombination between the alleles [64]. Transcriptome analysis of S. scitamineum during in vitro growth and development in planta showed that mating-type genes are expressed in both conditions. The two mating-types were grown individually in order to obtain the RNAseq data in vitro, which suggests that contact is either not needed to favor gene expression of mating-type genes, or that a very short period of interaction is enough to induce gene expression, since cells were mixed immediately prior centrifugation and RNA extraction. The expression of mating-type genes at the a and b  loci are induced by pheromone in U. maydis, that leads to amplification of the pheromone signal during the mating and to increased expression of b genes prior to fusion [72]. A single HMG box transcription factor, PrfI (pheromone response factor I), plays an important role in mediating this interaction between the a and b pathways. Prf1 protein binds specifically to pheromone response elements (PREs), which occur in clusters in the promoter regions in the vicinity of all genes in both loci[72]. Although in different numbers and orientations, PREs have been found close to the mating-type genes in S. scitamineum and other fungi studied, excepting Malassezia species to which so far no sexual cycle has been observed [73]. The pfr1 gene is also expressed in all RNAseq experiments analyzed of S. scitamineum, suggesting that the same kind of regulation of a and b loci occurs in this species.  Plant host-pathogen interaction transcriptome analysis  The combination of genome sequencing and transcriptome profiling is a proven approach to bring insights into pathogen mechanisms to invade host tissues, strategies of acquiring nutrients, avoid plant defense and to provoke disease symptoms. All these events are accomplished by a series of signals inducing a transcriptional reprogramming of fungal metabolism resulting in survival and dissemination within the host.  Our comparative transcriptome profiling showed that approximately 13.5% of S. scitamineum genes were either detected as differentially expressed in planta at 5 or 200 DAI. These genes are related to several metabolic processes important to fungal survival and protection in host tissues. One of these processes involves the chitin modification, mechanism that prevents the generation of elicitor active chitin oligomers which reveals the presence of the pathogen in the plant, triggering defense responses. The deacetylation of surface-exposed chitin into chitosan acts as a molecular disguise strategy [74–76]. Deacetylase is one of the most up-regulated gene at 5 DAI, indicating that S. scitamineum uses this strategy to dodge the plant defense in the early phases of fungal establishment. Que and collegues (2014) [77] determined the increase of chitinase gene expression in sugarcane transcriptome profiling of a resistance variety compared to susceptible plants.  The ability to pass through the plant cell wall by secreting a complex of extracellular cell wall degrading enzymes is evident in S. scitamineum. These enzymes are well known in filamentous plant pathogens and are necessary for entry into plant tissues [76, 78–81]. However, the amount of these enzymes may vary according to the fungal lifestyle. Biotrophic fungi can have fewer enzymes than hemibiotrophic and necrotrophic fungi [82]. In our study, the number of CAZymes (279) detected in the S. scitamineum genome is similar to other biotrophic fungus [83]. We found a small set of 54 cell wall degrading enzymes, some of which have been identified as up-regulated genes in planta at 5 and 200 DAI, such as those involved in cellulose, pectin and hemicellulose degradation.  Surpassing the cell barrier, pathogens have to breakdown proteins, sugars, lipids and nucleic acids [84]. Nineteen enzymes associated with digestion of proteins were detected among the secreted proteins. The transcriptome revealed that genes related to proteases were also up-regulated in planta. The fungal proteases may inhibit the activity of plant pathogenesis-related protein [85–87]. Another defense strategy potentially used by the fungus is the secretion of a cysteine-protease inhibitor to minimize the plant response, since the plant proteolytic machinery plays important roles in defense against pathogens [88].  Enzymes that target lipids, including lipases, triacyglycerol lipase and phospholipase were also found to have genes up-regulated at both time points analyzed. Lipases and phospholipases have been proposed to be essential not only for human pathogen virulence [89], but also for pathogens interacting with plants [90]. Eleven putative lipases were found in U. maydis potentially related to pathogenicity [91]. Lipase activities were associated with the fungal filamentous growth in vitro in the presence of lipids and also responsive to the known mating signaling pathways of the corn pathogen [91].  S. scitamineum seems to use another pathogen protective strategy to survive within sugarcane by the ability to detoxify the environment. Plants secrete various antimicrobial compounds into the apoplast to restrict pathogen growth. Examples are steroidal glycoalkaloids, such as saponin, and plant derived reactive oxygen species (ROS), which accumulate upon MAMP (microbe-associated molecular patterns) perception [92]. One of these detoxifying enzymes possibly used by S. scitamineum is related to pisatin demethylase, which was found up-regulated at 200 DAI. The pea pathogen Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. pisi is able to detoxify the phytoalexin pisatin, a substrate-inducible cytochrome P450, produced as a plant defense response [93]. Other genes related to cytochrome P450 and benzoate 4-monooxygenase are up-regulated at 200 DAI, which may indicate the need of detoxification in planta. These enzymes produce phenolic derivatives that are channeled to the b-ketoadipate pathway for aromatic compound degradation [94, 95]. Superoxide dismutase and catalases are also highly relevant to pathogenic fungal protection in planta[96, 97]. It has been reported that sugarcane resistant varieties produce an oxidative burst response upon smut infection [98]. These enzymes are involved in oxidative stress response against host superoxide radical (O2  -) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), respectively. Their importance in the initial penetration is well documented [9, 99], but expression in the final stages (200 DAI) of smut sugarcane colonization in sugarcane may provide an additional protection against oxidative stress.  Of the differentially expressed genes at 5 DAI, nine have homologues in the PHI-base. Noteworthy are three up-regulated genes that code for sugar/glucose transporter and maltose permease, which in U. maydis mutants shows reduced virulence [100]. Among the differentially expressed genes at 200 DAI, 33 have homologues in the PHI-base. These genes are related to sugar, nicotinic acid, peptide transporters and the secreted proteins beta-glucosidase, lipase and aspartic protease. The sugar transporter coded by g1034_chr02_Ss is an ortholog of the U. maydis plasma membrane-localized sucrose transporter (Srt1), which is sucrose specific, and allows the direct utilization of sucrose without the production of extracellular monosaccharides known to elicit plant immune responses [100]. The presence of invertase is also indicative that sucrose breakdown is relevant for sporulation and whip development, leading support to the decrease of sucrose content in later stages of disease development [6]. The biotrophic interaction of S. scitamineum and sugarcane leads to increased invertase gene expression also by the plant, which is potentially to limit the sugar access to the pathogen, however the fungus present various sugar transporters that can increase the range of sugars and ways of intake this carbon source [101]. These mechanisms are probably among the ones that make this pathosystem very particular. Among other sugar transporter-encoding genes we found three quinate permease genes (g72_chr01_Ss; g1719_chr03_Ss and g2935_chr06_Ss) that were differentially expressed at 200 DAI. Quinate can serve as source of carbon to M. oryzae in early stages of rice infection [102]. M oryzae modulates expression of common genes related to the conversion between quinate and shikimate pathways by increasing quinate availability and decreasing products of the shikimate pathway, such as defensive phenylpropanoids. It is known that early sugarcane infection with S. scitamineum triggers expression of phenylpropanoid as a means of protection against fungal infection [77, 103]. In sugarcane it remains to be established whether quinate is available in the later stages of interaction, although these quinate assimilation genes up-regulated could be related to shunt of plant phenylpropanoid metabolism during smut whip emergence.  Laccase genes were also found to be differentially expressed in the fungus upon infection in sugarcane, revealing the potential of S. scitamineum for breaking down lignified tissues. Laccase is a polyphenol oxidase that catalyzes the reduction of O2 to H2O using a range of phenolic compounds as hydrogen donors, including lignin [104], that is the second most abundant constituent of the vascular plants cell wall, acting in cellulose protection towards hydrolytic microbial attack [105]. Sugarcane is known to respond to the presence of smut by modulating the expression of genes related to lignin pathways [98, 106, 107].  Our detailed annotation of the S. scitamineum genome revealed the presence of three genes encoding laccases. One of them, part of the described secretome, is encoded by the gene g1208_chr02_Ss, which is up-regulated in both 5 and 200 DAI, with values of Log2FoldChange of 6.56 and 7.59, respectively. Secreted laccases are related to lignin breakdown [108] and has great potential to be studied in numerous biotechnological applications, including those related to second generation of biofuels [97, 109, 110]. However, laccases can also be involved in various fungal physiological processes, for instance, the development of fruiting bodies [111] and spore pigmentation [112]. The transcriptome analysis results showed another laccase up-regulated at 200 DAI, which is not secreted (g4962_chr14_Ss, Log2FoldChange = 5.49). In this case this gene is possibly involved with pigment biosynthesis, since this stage of fungal development is characterized by intensive teliospore differentiation. Polyketide synthases encoding genes related to secondary metabolite production such as those involved in pigment biosynthesis were also found up-regulated at 200 DAI.  During the co-evolution of fungal plant pathogens and their hosts there has been a seesawing interplay between pathogen virulence and host resistance. Thus, to facilitate infection, plant pathogens secrete numerous effector proteins into the plant apoplast or cytosol [113]. Besides the strategies used to defend itself from plant immune system, S. scitamineum seems to have an arsenal of effectors that can potentially manipulate host metabolism [9, 114, 115]. S. scitamineum SSC39B secretome includes 70 proteins candidates for effectors, 51 annotated as either hypothetical or conserved hypothetical proteins. A similar number of candidates (43) was reported to occur in the 2014001 S. scitamineum strain [9]. Additionally, the authors used RT-qPCR analysis to reveal that 47% of these candidate genes were expressed in S. scitamineum in the early stages of the infection [9].  The transcriptomic data provided us with indications of S. scitamineum effectors that are transcriptionally active. Among them are the known effectors chorismate mutase, and salicylate hydroxylase [116], both involved in attenuating plant salicylic acid level reported in U. maydis[117], and Pep1 of U. maydis[118], an apoplastic inhibitor of host peroxidases [9, 119, 120]. As probable novel effectors used by S. scitamineum during sugarcane interaction we can highlight three genes (g2_chr01_Ss, g3890_chr10, and g1513_chr03_Ss) among the preferentially expressed in plant at 5 DAI, which encode to small secreted proteins of 236, 135 and 215 amino acids respectively. These genes have no identifiable conserved domains or any particular sequence feature. At 200 DAI the uncharacterized secreted proteins encoded by the highly expressed genes g3870_chr10_Ss, g488_chr01_Ss and g5684_chr17_Ss, are rich in glycine residues. In M. oryzae, members of the pwl gene family codify to small glycine-rich secreted proteins acting as Avrs conferring host specificity [121, 122].  A potential pathogenicity factor of the S. scitamineum is the most highly expressed genes of the secretome at 5 DAI (g3970_chr10_Ss). The encoded protein sequence presents several repeated motifs, such as “PQPQDGQ” residues represented seven times close to the N-terminal region and “PYGDKPNGDAENSDS” repeated eight times towards the C-terminal region. Its homologous in U. maydis, um03274, is expressed only in plant and not in axenic cultures [123] and in S. scitamineum the expression of this gene is low during in vitro growth. Sequences rich in proline and glutamine residues were found in the human fungal pathogen Candida albicans, where the 10-amino-acid long N-terminal repeat in the Hwp1p adhesin allows covalent cross-linking to host cells [124, 125]. All these genes of undetermined functions from S. scitamineum secretome, which are among the most expressed in plant, are good targets for experimental analyses to elucidate potential involvement in fungal growth and disease development.  In order to provide deeper analysis of S. scitamineum transcriptional profiles, we searched for the distribution of genes specifically expressed in planta, which allowed for the identification of 10 putative pathogenicity islands, a characteristic widespread in fungal pathogen genomes, which can harbor probable effectors. In the U. maydis, for instance were found 12 islands of genes encoding small secreted proteins with unknown function; most of them are co-regulated and induced in infected tissues, and deletion of individual islands can alter the pathogen virulence, leading in some cases to a complete lack of symptoms [7]. The evidence that some of them are only present in the S. scitamineum genome suggests its involvement in the sugarcane specificity, which is an important trait underlying the interaction of smuts with their hosts, but still poorly understood at the molecular level. Despite being phylogenetically close, the smut fungi infect different members of the Poaceae, and vary in their mode of plant colonization and symptom development. Searching for species-specific genes is a promising strategy to identify genes involved in host-specific adaptations [51, 126]. An important feature found in four of the predicted islands (chromosomes 2, 6, 10 and 11) is the presence of repetitive elements, that have been viewed as drivers of genome evolution by promoting genome rearrangements and possible gene regulation [127], and this can be related to the smut fungus adaptability towards sugarcane colonization.  Conclusions  The de novo complete genome assembly allowed us the determination of subtelomeric regions, mating-type loci, repetitive elements and the sequence and annotation of mtDNA of S. scitamineum. The mtDNA with 88 kb in length is within the size range expected for members of the Ustiloginales and the genome is rich in potential mobile introns with some evidence that duplications may have been generated by the activity of intron encoded homing endonucleases. Comparisons to other smut genome sequences revealed that chromosomal reorganizations related to the mating loci and details of the sequences linking both loci may be used in further evolutionary studies. The combination of transcriptomic data obtained in different phases of the fungal life cycle disclosed modulation of gene expression revealing that S. scitamineum uses common strategies to survive within sugarcane but also uncovered novelties that are associated to the specific interaction with sugarcane. The onset of infection is similar to those of other smut interactions. For instance, orthologues of U. maydis known virulence factors were found to be expressed in S. scitamineum during infection phase by means of attenuation of the salicylate mediated defense response. New candidate effectors have been identified and are organized in 10 genomic islands which are expressed only in planta, some of which S. scitamineum specific. Plant cell wall degrading enzymes, proteases and lipases are up-regulated potentially associated to the entry of the pathogen. Fungal defense responses were also a common strategy regarding the interaction with sugarcane. The fungus accumulates a series of transcripts encoding proteins to survive ROS and other toxins potentially produced by the plant. To avoid recognition by the host plant S. scitamineum probably uses chitin modifications. During the development of the whip and sporogenesis the presence of transcripts related to detoxification of plant metabolites as well as ROS are evident. The fungus metabolism shifts to the accumulation of sugar transporters and invertase transcripts, to use sucrose directly and/or sucrose monomers derivatives. Increased laccase activities both extracellular and non-secreted were detected. Laccases are regarded as potentially involved in lignin degradation and to pigment biosynthesis. This study suggests a new promising research aiming at the biotechnological use of S.scitamineum as well as provides valuable targets for experimental studies to confirm pathogen genes involved parasite/host interaction, with perspectives for applications in disease management and sugarcane breeding.

PMC4466345,Introduction,Introduction,FQ311469,0,0,0,,,"  Introduction  Sugarcane is an important crop worldwide due to its capability to store large amounts of sucrose in the stem, supplying more than half of the world’s sugar consumption for centuries [1]. Currently, it is also considered the most efficient bioenergy crop for ethanol production [2]. One important factor impairing the increase of sugarcane production is the severity of some diseases affecting the crop [3]. Sporisorium scitamineum, causal agent of the sugarcane smut disease, is a constant concern among producers and breeders, since the disease has been found at low levels in all cultivated areas. There are three distinct phases during the fungal life cycle: haploid yeast-like sporidia, dikaryotic hyphae and diploid teliospores (Fig 1). To infect the host, a combination of two haploid sporidia belonging to opposite mating-types is necessary to form an infective hyphae. Fungal hyphae differentiate appressorium structures to penetrate plant tissues. Sugarcane infected plants show a profound metabolic modification resulting in the development of a whip-like structure from the stalk apex composed of a mixture of plant and fungal tissues. Within these structures millions of dark teliospores develop and are responsible for disseminating the disease [4]. Under appropriate environmental conditions, teliospores germinate promycelia leading to meiosis and production of haploid sporidia that will become infective after the fusion of compatible sporidial cells [5]. Hyphal fusion and sexual cycle are crucial for disease establishment and dissemination. In vitro, S. scitamineum is maintained easily as colonies of yeast-like cells derived of budding sporidia and hyphal colonies, which facilitates genetic studies [6]. The only part of the life cycle restricted to host tissues so far is the development of teliospores. Sugarcane plants are prone to pathogen attack in the early stages of growth, however, whips are observed only after 45 days in more susceptible varieties. Infected sugarcane plants have abnormal grass-like growth, reduced culm diameter, and very fibrous stalks which are poor in sugar content [4].  10.1371/journal.pone.0129318.g001  Fig 1  (A) Developmental stages in the S. scitamineum life cycle: diploid teliospores (2n); haploid yeast-like sporidia (n) after meiosis (R!); hyphal fusion.

(G) Photomicrograph of black whip portion showing the mature spore liberation. Scale bar = 5 μm  Although little information is available from S. scitamineum biology, more is known about its close relative Ustilago maydis, a smut fungus of corn. Noteworthy in the latter, are a number of genes arranged in groups encoding uncharacterized secreted proteins associated with the control of fungal colonization in host plants [7]. Although among various smut fungi the genomes are similar in size and gene content, disease symptoms related to the formation of fungal sporangial structures and host specificity are unique to each smut species/plant interaction, and therefore comparative analysis may help to uncover genes that trigger specific host responses [8]. This work presents the fully sequenced genome of S. scitamineum SSC39B and a draft of isolates BSES, which enabled us to perform comparative analysis to another genome sequence recently published [9]. The complete sequence of each chromosome of S. scitamineum SSC39B also enabled comparisons regarding genome organization to the closest smut species S. reilianum[10]. Fungal transcriptome profiles during in vitro growth and throughout its life cycle in planta at two time points revealed candidate genes unique to the interaction with sugarcane.  ",FALSE,TRUE,"This is a hard example. The target key is referring to a mitochondrial genome, which is only mentioned explicitly for genome size comparison. The dataset is actually used elsewhere in the paper however. They also use the chromosomal DNA for comparison, and that is utilized much more heavily. But neither identifier is mentioned very often, so it's similar to Kangiella in that they refer to this thing in several places without the ID, but with the added difficulty that two different, but similar genomic datasets for the same organism are being leveraged"
PMC4466345,Materials and Methods,Materials and Methods,FQ311469,1,0,0,,mtDNA from S. Reilianum used as a reference for the newly sequenced mtDNA,"  Materials and Methods  Ethics Statement  S. scitamineum SSC39B haploid cells derived from a single mating-type were used for complete genome sequencing. The cells were obtained from a teliospore (SSC39) isolated from a whip developed in the sugarcane susceptible clone IACSP98-2053. The whip was collected from an experimental area of “Centro de Cana—Instituto Agronômico de Campinas” (21°12′04″S; 47°52′20″W), and no specific permissions were required for sampling diseased plants in this location. The isolates BSESs were isolated from a teliospore isolated from a whip developed in a susceptible sugarcane clone Q117. The whip was collected from an experimental field at the Sugar Research Australia pathology farm at Woodford, Australia (26°55′43”S; 152°46′38.3”E), no specific permissions were required for sampling diseased plants in this location.  Strains and sequencing strategies  S. scitamineum haploid cells derived from a single mating-type were used for complete genome sequencing. A single yeast-like colony was isolated and mating-type was assigned as described in Bölker et al. (1992) [11]. The S. scitamineum SSC39B genome was sequenced using the long reads PacBio technology [12]. DNA was extracted using “DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit” (Qiagen). Five SMRT cells (P5-C3 chemistry) were used in the sequencing process, generating 2.2 Gbp of raw data corresponding to more than 100 fold of sampling depth (738,568 reads with average length of 3,047 bp). Besides PacBio sequencing, paired-end libraries of the same strain were sequenced using Illumina HiSeq 2000. A whole cell DNA library was prepared for sequencing using the kit Nextera DNA Sample Preparation Workflow (Illumina paired-end). A total of 85,465,786 reads of 100 bp in length (approximately 8.5 Gb) corresponding to more than 400 fold of sampling depth were analyzed using FASTQC (ver. 0.10.1) and Seqyclean (ver. 1.8.10) to filter low quality sequences (phred quality below 20).  In addition, an isolate of the opposite mating-type (SSC39A) was partially sequenced using a BAC genomic library that was constructed using the protocol described by Peterson et al. (2000) [13] and the “CopyControlT BAC Cloning Kit” (Epicentre). The genomic library is composed of 2,880 clones with an insert size average of 92 kbp representing 10 X coverage of the genome. Forty-eight BAC clones were selected from pools of 30 plates (96 clones each). Included in this analysis were PCR amplifications for the mating-type genes using the enzyme “GenomiPhi” (GE Healthcare Life Sciences) in combination with following primers for: Locus b (UsibEF 5’ -GCTGGTCCAACATTCTCC- 3’ and UsibER 5’ -CGCTTGCTCTCTGCTTAG- 3’) and Locus a (SSC39AF 5’ -AGATCGGGAAGAAAATG-AGC- 3’ and SSC39AR 5’ -TTGTATCATCGTGGGTCTCTGG- 3’). Sequencing data were generated with Illumina HiSeq technology, also with paired-end reads of 100 bp in length. These reads were used to assemble the mating loci sequence of SSC39A.  Two additional Australian isolates, BSES15 and BSES17, which represent contrasting mating-types, were also sequenced using the Illumina platform. Illumina sequencing generated paired-end 90bp reads on an Illumina GAIIx and 5,588,889 read pairs (1.01 Gbp) and 4,335,980 read pairs (0.78 Gbp) were generated for isolates BSES15 and BSES17 respectively.  Genome Assembly  Given the high coverage of PacBio reads, the HGAP.2 assembler [14] was used with default parameters. The resulting assembly was composed of 59 contigs (19 Mbp) and 11 singletons (88 kbp). A final genome version was built manually with the alignment results, generating 26 final contigs (genome V0). CLC Genomics Workbench V7.01 (CLC Bio) was then used to align all Illumina reads against this assembly. The consensus of the aligned Illumina paired-end reads (parameters: global alignment, minimum of 0.9 read length with minimum 90% identity) against the V0 genome was then saved as the V1 S. scitamineum genome. This assembly was aligned against the S. reilianum genome using cross_match (www.phrap.org). The mitochondrial genome was assembled individually (CLC Genomics Workbench V7.01) by using the mitochondrial sequence of S. reilianum as reference. The DNA data of BSES15 and BSES17 was analyzed using the Blue error correcting algorithm [15] and assembled using the Velvet Optimiser algorithm of the Velvet assembler [16] at an optimal k-mer length of 77.  Pulse field gel electrophoresis and hybridization  DNA plugs for pulse-field gel electrophoresis were prepared using CHEF Genomic DNA Plug Kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories Inc.) as described previously [17]. Fragments from 200 to 2200 kbp were separated in contour-clamped homogeneous electric field electrophoresis, conducted in a CHEF II (Bio-Rad Laboratories Inc.) apparatus. Pulse-field electrophoresis was carried out as follows: a 1% agarose gel in 0.5x TBE buffer was held at 14°C by a temperature-controlled cooling unit for 15 h, at 6 V x cm-1, electric current was regulated with the initial pulse = final pulse = 70 s, and a second step for 11 h, 6 V x cm-1 (initial pulse = final pulse = 120 s). Size of bands were estimated by the software Kodak Digital Science 1D 3.0.2, using Pulse Marker 225-2200 kbp (Sigma-Aldrich Corp.). Hybridizations were performed using “AlkPhos” Direct Labeling and Detection System’ (GE). Probes used were sequences of a telomere insert of pTEL13 [18] and a PCR amplicon containing the rDNA internal transcribed spacer region (ITS1, 5.8S and ITS2) of S. scitamineum generated with primers: Hs 5’ -AACACGGTTGCATCGGTTGGGTC- 3’ and Ha 5’ -GCTTCTTGCTCATCCTCACCACCAA- 3’) [19].  Genome and Proteome Annotations  Gene prediction was accomplished by using the U. maydis gene model calculated by the Augustus software [20] integrating the RNAseq paired-end reads (see further below). The tRNAs were identified by the tRNAscan-SE program [21]. Repetitive elements were identified using RECON [22], setting BLASTn to a cutoff of e-value ≤ 1 × 10-10. Only families with more than 15 members with sequences ranging from 500 to 2,500 bp were considered to be repetitive elements. BLASTx searches against UNIREF50 were performed to identify transposable elements containing one of the following PFAM domains: PF00078, PF01498, PF03108, PF03184, PF03221, PF10551, PF13359 [23]. RepeatMasker [24] annotation supplied with our custom library (RECON + RepBase v. 19.11) was used to define repetitive elements.  Telomeric repeats were identified by the Tandem Repeat Database (TRDB) tool [25]. The length and localization of each telomere as well as the subtelomeric predicted genes within the chromosome ends (50 kbp) were manually checked.  Predicted proteins were analyzed using the Blast2Go tool V2.7.2 (BLASTp with cutoff e-value < 1 x 10-5) [26] and Fisher’s exact test was used to detect enrichment of GO terms (p-value ≤ 0.05). The programs SignalP V4.0.1c [27], TMHMM V2.0c [28] and predGPI [29] were used to predict those proteins that are potentially secreted and to define the secretome. The HMMs from dbCAN [30] were used to predict and classify the CAZymes. Reference proteins of the PHI-base (Pathogen-Host Interaction database) [31] were used to obtain experimental evidences to our predicted proteins using BLASTp e-value < 1 x 10-14 and query coverage of more than 80%.  The mitochondrial genome was annotated with the MFannot program combined with RNAweasel [32]. The potential rnl gene and putative ORFs, including intron/exon junctions, were further resolved with ORFfinder and by comparative sequence analysis using the BLAST suite of programs and by aligning intron containing genes with orthologs that lack insertions. Alignments were performed with the MAFFT program [33] with settings that allow for long insertions and short conserved regions and these alignments were manually adjusted with the Genedoc program to narrow intron/exon junctions [34]. Intergenic regions were examined with ORFfinder to identify potential remnants of ORFs, in particular eroded homing endonuclease coding segments.  Comparative genome analysis  Synteny studies between chromosomes of S. reilianum and S. scitamineum were performed using BLASTn (cutoff e-value ≤ 1 x 10-5) combined with Circos [35] to draw the relationships between chromosomes. In addition the complete genome of strain SSC39B was compared to the BSES assembly using cross_match. The scaffolds from the genome assembly of the strain 2014001 (Genbank: JFOL00000000.1) [9] was aligned using MUMmer (V3.0), and BEDTools [36] merging local similarities in a range of 1,500 bp of the genome alignment.  Comparisons of predicted coding sequences among the three strains were performed using BLASTn. Genes particular to the SSC39B were defined by considering either “no hit” or an e-value > 1 x 10-5.  The S. scitamineum SSC39B proteome was compared to all predicted proteins of U. maydis, U. hordei and S. reilianum (MIPS database [37]). OrthoMCL with default parameters was used to determine the orthologous groups among the proteomes [38]. Visualization of the OrthoMCL results was obtained with a four-way-Venn-diagram drawn in R language using the Venn diagram package [39].  Phylogenetic analysis of mating-type protein sequences were performed based on a multiple sequence alignment generated by T-COFFEE [40]. The best amino acids substitution model that fits the data was determined by using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) in the software ProtTest v3.2 [41]. Maximum likelihood trees were obtained for each protein considering the heuristic method NNI (Nearest Neighbor Interchange) for searching through treespace and aLRT SH-like (approximate Likelihood-Ratio Test with Shimodaira-Hasegawa-like procedure) for quantifying branch support using PhyML v3.0 [42]. S. scitamineum protein sequences of both mating-types and sequences for close related species available on GenBank were included in the analysis.  Transcriptome assay and analysis  The S. scitamineum SSC39 teliospores (> 90% viability) were mixed with saline solution and used to inoculate sugarcane plants of the smut susceptible variety “RB92-5345”. Single budded sets of 7 month-old plants were surface disinfected, heat treated (52°C for 30 min in water bath, 1 kg of buds/6L of water) and incubated for 16 h at 28°C. Sets were then placed on trays with buds facing upwards, and inoculated using the wound-paste method [43]. Pots were kept in the greenhouse arranged into a completely randomized experimental design. Fungal transcriptome profiles were obtained 5 days after inoculation (DAI) from tissues of the breaking buds and at 200 DAI from the base of the whip-like structure emission (where intense fungal cell division and sporogenesis occurs). For in vitro transcriptome analysis, haploid yeast-like cells of opposite mating-types were grown separately in liquid medium [44] in a orbital shaker for 15 h at 28°C. Cells of both mating-types were mixed prior to RNA extraction. All samples were frozen in liquid nitrogen immediately after collection and stored at -80°C. Three biological replicates were systematically used.  Total RNA extraction from 5 DAI samples was performed using the lithium chloride based method [45, 46]. TRIzol Reagent (Life Technologies, UK) was used for RNA extraction from 200 DAI samples and control cells. DNA was extracted from the same 5 DAI samples to confirm infection before the construction of RNAseq libraries. The rDNA ITS region was amplified with primers Hs and Ha [19] to confirm the presence of S. scitamineum.  Libraries were constructed following Illumina manufacturer’s protocol of the “TruSeq RNA Sample Prep v2 Low Throughput (LT)” kit. Paired-end sequencing was performed on the Illumina platform (HiScanSQ). Reads were analyzed by FASTQC (ver. 0.10.1) and low quality bases (phred ≥ 20), Illumina adapters and poly-A tails were removed using the Seqyclean program (ver. 1.8.10). The RNAseq fungal reads from the 5 DAI and 200 DAI plant materials were recovered from the total reads by mapping to the complete genome of S. scitamineum SSC39B strain using Bowtie2 [47]. RNAseq reads were also aligned to all S. scitamineum coding sequences, using Bowtie2 with default parameters to determine the % of CDSs length coverage.  Differential transcript accumulation among treatments (5 DAI and 200 DAI and controls) was observed using the CLC Genomics Workbench V7.01. Fungal reads were mapped to CDSs of S. scitamineum (100% of nucleotide identity and 98% of coverage). The mapping of at least one read pair in all three replicates was considered to be a positive match. Scaling approach as implemented in the CLC software was used as the normalization method. Baggerley’s test and the false discovery rate (FDR) with a significance level of ≤ 0.01 and Log2FoldChange ≥ 2 or ≤ -2 (treatment/control) were applied to generate a set of differentially expressed genes. Transcripts were considered specific to the interaction with sugarcane if at least one pair of reads mapped to all three replicates of each of the treatments and none to the control. Enrichment test of GO terms were performed with the BLAST2GO tool using the two-side Fisher’s Exact Test (p-value < 0.05).  ",FALSE,TRUE,

PMC4466345,Results,Results and Discussion,FQ311469,0,0,0,,,"  Results  General Results  PacBio sequencing allowed us to determine the complete sequence of S. scitamineum SSC39B chromosomes. The final assembly comprises 19,979,571 nucleotides distributed in 26 contigs (no gaps within contigs). Telomere motifs were identified for 23 chromosomes longer than 475 kbp in length (Table A in S1 File). The other three contigs (24, 25, 26) have 87,293, 82,225 and 99,152 kbp, respectively, and are also found in the assemblies of 2014001 and BSESs genomes (Figure A in S1 File). The results of PFGE hybridized with telomeric probes (Figure B in S1 File) confirmed the presence of a DNA band of around 100 kbp. Sequence analysis revealed that these contigs are composed of repetitive elements (Figure A in S1 File) and have few predicted genes supported by RNAseq. At this time remains to be established if all of the three assembled contigs are chromosomes of S. scitamineum or if they are misassembles of one or more small chromosomes.  The rDNA cluster was found to be close to the end of chromosome numbered 23 and three copies were assembled. Hybridization data (Figure B in S1 File) together with the coverage of Illumina reads allowed us to estimate that there were 130 copies of rDNA units comprising the rDNA region. Unexpectedly, the length of the chromosome harboring the rDNA sequence varied between the two isolates of the same genetic background but with opposite mating types (Figure B in S1 File). This result was confirmed using hybridizations with probes prepared from two independent regions of the rDNA (data not shown). The rDNA gene cluster is composed of 5,979 bp (18S—5.8 S—28S) and the first copy is located at coordinates 119,074 of chromosome 23. The 5 S rDNA genes are scattered among the chromosomes and 14 copies were identified. Similarly, 111 tRNA genes corresponding to all 20 amino acids were found to be dispersed among the chromosomes (Table B in S1 File).  Assemblies of the BSES15 and BSES17 isolates generated 5,331 contigs. A total of 19,234,547 bp (99%) aligned to the strain SSC39B genome with the following variation: 0.075% substitutions, 0.007% deletions and 0.038% insertions. The comparison between the genome sequences of the SSC39B and 2014001 strains (the last presenting 19,619,026 bp organized in 35 scaffolds [9]) showed that most of the chromosomes assembled are covered. However, the mitochondrial genome was poorly represented in the 2014001 assembly and nuclear genome derived scaffolds do not extend over repetitive regions as well as subtelomeric regions (Fig 2).  10.1371/journal.pone.0129318.g002  Fig 2  Representation of all chromosomes and contigs assembled of the strain SSC39 genome compared to the strain 2014001 scaffolds.  Regions present in the strain 2014001 are shown in green blocks, delimited by black borders. White regions represent sequences unique to the strain SSC39 assembly. The analysis was performed using MUMmer 3 and parameters = -maxmatch -c -L -b -l 500. Red line above the chromosome 2 indicates the region containing the mating-type loci  The S. scitamineum strain SSC39 genome comprises 6,677 protein coding genes, with an average number of introns per gene of 1.94, and 51% of the genes (3,415) have no introns (Table C in S1 File). Most of the CDSs are between 500 and 2,000 kbp in length (3,861) and only a few are larger than 7 kbp (34) (Figure C in S1 File). In general most of the CDSs have an ortholog in the S. reilianum genome (Fig 3).  10.1371/journal.pone.0129318.g003  Fig 3  Syntenic view of two chromosomes of S. reilianum that merged as one in S. scitamineum.  Links represents alignment length of more than 1 kbp obtained by BLASTn (e-value < 1 x 10-5). The first outer circle represents the chromosome and scale is coordinates in base pairs. The second indicates the GC content followed by predicted coding regions of the plus and minus strands. Bars display the % of identity to orthologous in S. reilianum. The most inner circle represents the RNAseq coverage of each chromosome region. Red lines are RNAseq data of S. scitamineum growing in planta and blue lines growing in vitro. Circle images of all chromosomes are available in the Supporting Information S3 File.  Of the total S. scitamineum predicted genes, 6,479 (97%) are supported by mapping the reads produced by RNAseq analysis. A total of 198 have no coverage, but 72 of these have significant matches (BLASTn e-value ≤ 1 x 10-14 and query coverage ≥ 75%) to putative CDSs of U. maydis, S. reilianum or U. hordei genomes. Repetitive elements represented 1.24% of the S. scitamineum genome. Gene Ontology was used to assign GO terms to the set of predicted proteins to improve the organization of the annotation data [26]. GO terms were successfully assigned to 3,682 proteins (55.2%) (Table A in S2 File). As expected, top hit species results (5,078) are with S. reilianum proteins (Figure B in S2 File).  Telomeric and subtelomeric regions  Telomeric arrays of tandem repeats were localized at both ends of all chromosomes, with an average repeat length of 76 bp that range from 32 bp to 140 bp (Table A in S1 File). The subtelomeric gene set comprises 800 predicted genes coding for proteins. Thirty-five helicase genes located in 22 chromosome ends were found, which include 3 predicted telomere-linked RecQ-helicase (TLH) genes, a typical feature of subtelomeric regions. As observed in other fungi, a notable group of genes related to niche adaptation (carbon utilization and catabolism) and pathogenicity were also reported (Table D in S1 File). Yet, some of the uncharacterized genes located near the chromosome ends are potentially associated with interaction with sugarcane (discussed later) (Fig 3).  Chromosomal rearrangements and mating-type analysis  Comparative genomics showed that among the four smut fungi genomes used here S. scitamineum and S. reilianum are the closest, with an average nucleotide identity of 85.4% among all predicted CDSs. Eight S. scitamineum chromosomes display different arrangements with regards to S. reilianum as well as breaking points enriched with transposable elements (Figs. in S3 File). One of such breaking points is a region relevant to the biology of S. scitamineum that links the two mating-type loci referred to as a and b. In S. scitamineum, both loci are located 59 kbp apart on chromosome 2, characteristic of a bipolar mating system [48] (Fig 4). Chromosome 2 of S. scitamineum is homologous to chromosomes 1 and 20 of S. reilianum, which also harbor the mating-type loci  b and a, respectively, in a tetrapolar arrangement [49]. Pairwise comparisons of these chromosomes revealed that the breakpoint occurred at the position 825,021 of S. scitamineum chromosome 2 (Fig 4). Within this inter-mating-type loci several remnants of DDE_1 and LINE transposons were noted. In addition, 20% of the sequence in between bases 801,345 and 854,308 is composed of repetitive elements, a much larger percentage when compared to the respective 1.24% of the genome.  10.1371/journal.pone.0129318.g004  Fig 4  Blocks of synteny between chromosome 2 of S. scitamineum and chromosomes 1 and 20 of S. reilianum and schematic representation of the linked mating-type loci in S. scitamineum.  Blue areas correspond to syntenic regions considering BLASTn e-value ≤ 1 x 10-5. Red lines represent the expansion of the region containing the mating type genes in S. scitamineum located at positions 792,295 bp to 863,606 bp of the chromosome 2. The chromosome breakpoint is identified and indicated by a red dot above the sequence.

The mating-type loci of the SSC39B complete genome sequence are equivalent to MAT1 of U. hordei and a1 of U. maydis, as determined by the similarity to genes of the mating loci (Figure A in S4 File). Based on the percentage of sequence identity, phylogenetic analysis and gene organization comparisons (Figures A and B and Table A in S4 File), the mating-type proteins of close and distantly related smut species differ substantially. BLASTp analysis shows that predicted proteins from whole genome of S. scitamineum have, on average, 82.5, 75.4 and 72.4% of identity with proteins of S. reilianum, U. maydis and U. hordei, respectively. In contrast, their mating-type proteins have lower percentages of identity (Table A in S4 File).  Phylogenetic analysis was performed including other smut mating-type protein sequences extracted from databases and proteins encoded by the opposite mate pair of S. scitamineum obtained by sequencing BAC genomic library inserts (Figure B in S4 File). Proteins encoded by b locus (bE1/bE2 and bW1/bW2) of S. scitamineum (SSC39A and SSC39B) are more close related to each other than to the bE and bW proteins from related species; whereas proteins encoded by its a locus (pra1/pra2 and mfa1.2/mfa1.3/mfa2.1/mfa2.3) cluster preferentially with alleles from others species (Figure A in S4 File). The genomic context indicates that the order and orientation of the genes in the b locus are conserved (Figure B in S4 File). Otherwise for the a locus, these settings vary among species and between alleles of the same species, especially by the presence of rga2 and lga2 genes in the a2-type alleles that are absent in the a1-type (Figure B in S4 File). The a locus of S. scitamineum and S. reilianum also differs from that of U. maydis and U. hordei by the presence of a second pheromone gene, named mfa1.3 in S. scitamineum due to its similarity to the pheromone mfa2.3 from S. reilianum. It is noteworthy that this extra copy of mfa in S. scitamineum lacks the characteristic CAAX motif (C, cysteine; A, aliphatic amino acid; X, any amino acid) at its carboxyl terminus. Pheromone response elements (PREs), with a binding motif “ACAAAGGGA” for transcription factor prf1, were found close to the mating-type genes in S. scitamineum and in the others fungi analyzed, with the exception of Malassezia species (Figure B in S4 File).  The mtDNA Annotation  The mitochondrial genome has 88,018 bp and presents the standard 14 protein coding genes (nad2, nad3, nad4, nad4L, nad5, nad6, cox1, cox2, cox3, cob, atp2, atp6, atp9 and rps3) along with 11 unknown hypothetical ORFs (Table A and B in S5 File). The last nucleotide of the nad2 gene is the first one of the nad3 gene. Among the RNA encoding genes, 22 tRNA genes were detected representing all 20 amino acids, and two tRNAs for each Ser and Met; the rns and rnl genes were also present and finally two potential copies of the rnpB gene were noted. However one copy is interrupted by tRNA(V) and may represent an eroded copy of the gene or a misannotation based on the presence of analogous RNA folds that resemble components of the rnpB encoded RNA molecule. Among the various genes 24 group I introns were noted, of these 23 encoded putative ORFs. The cox1 gene was the most intron rich gene with 11 insertions. Nineteen LAGLIDADG type endonuclease ORFs were noted and among these ORFs four showed evidence of degeneration, i.e. the fragmentation due the presence of premature stop codons. Four intron ORFs belong to the GIY-YIG family of homing endonucleases and two appear to have eroded, as above due to the accumulation of mutations and the presence of premature stop codons. A few eroded freestanding GIY-YIG ORFs were noted in the intergenic regions but these were quite fragmented and thus not annotated. The atp9, cox1, nad1, nad5, and nad6 genes were all followed by duplicated versions that lacked the N-terminal components. Differences between the complete version of the gene and the partial duplicated version fragments of GIY-YIG type ORFs could be detected by programs such as ORFfinder or by BLASTx.  Comparative proteome  A total of 6,475 groups of homologs were described among the four smut species analysed (S. scitamineum, S. reilianum, U. maydis, U. hordei), each one containing at least two proteins (Table A and Figure A in S6 File). The largest intersection was the one comprising the four species, with 5,507 orthologous groups (85.05%), among them, 5,347 containing exactly one ortholog from each proteome. S. scitamineum proteome contains few groups harboring paralogs, thus, most of their genes are single copy (94.3%) (Table 1). The largest paralog family has 61 members related to ATP-dependent DNA helicase (RecQ), some of which identified in close vicinity of telomeres as mentioned previously.  10.1371/journal.pone.0129318.t001  Table 1  Comparative analysis of orthology among four smut fungi obtained by OrthoMCL.

Most of the S. scitamineum unique genes (23 clusters including 89 proteins and 349 singletons) are related to transposable elements and uncharacterized proteins, but RNAseq reads suggest that some of these genes are active at the transcriptional level (Table C in S1 File). Among genes with predicted functions, there are for example, putative effectors related to the Mig1 gene family (g3918_chr10_Ss and g3919_chr10_Ss) and a group of six paralogs related to sterol delta 5,6-desaturase (g2628_chr06_Ss, g3812_chr10_Ss, g4371_chr12_Ss, g6420_chr22_Ss, g6606_chr24_Ss and g6623_chr24_Ss) (Table B in S6 File).  Secretome  The S. scitamineum genome encodes 527 predicted proteins showing a positive match to signal peptides, of these 342 have no transmembrane domains and 305 are also not anchored by GPI. These proteins were selected to compose the secretome of S. scitamineum. We used the HMMs from dbCAN to identify 54 CAZymes in the secretome, including eight containing carbohydrate binding modules (CBM), 11 carbohydrate esterases (CE), 30 glycoside hydrolases (GH), one glycosyl transferase (GT), one polysaccharide lyase (PL) and six with auxiliary activities (AA) (Table F in S1 File). Nearly 30% of secretome (93 proteins) have at least one GO term assigned according to Blast2GO results (Figure A in S7 File).  The secretome of S. scitamineum is composed of 148 (48.5%) predicted proteins of uncharacterized function. Moreover, 38 of these proteins are considered unique to S. scitamineum by OrthoMCL analysis (Table B in S6 File), wherein 29 proteins are singletons and nine proteins belong to three orthologous clusters.  We analyzed genes of the secretome expressed at 5 DAI and have constructed a heatmap showing the modulation of these genes under the three tested conditions (Fig 5). According to the functional annotation results, they encode hydrolases, peptidases, oxidases and reductases as well as several genes of unknown functions. The modulation of gene expression is particular to each time point during the interaction with sugarcane and to in vitro growth.  10.1371/journal.pone.0129318.g005  Fig 5  Genes encoding secreted proteins and their expression level under all three conditions: in vitro, 5 DAI, 200 DAI as calculated by CLC Genomics Workbench.  Heatmaps were obtained using the function heatmap.2 of the package gplots in R language  Transcriptome Analysis  The data revealed that 56.6%, 41.3% and 54.7% of RNAseq trimmed reads mapped in pairs to S. scitamineum CDSs in vitro, 5 DAI and 200 DAI, respectively (Table A in S8 File). The number of CDSs detected in each experiment was 6,213 (93%) in vitro, 437 (6.5%) at 5 DAI and 6,183 (92.6%) at 200 DAI. The RNAseq data were analyzed based on a combination of expression change threshold of Log2FoldChange (treatment/control) ≥ 2 or ≤ -2 among treatments, and relied on FDR as defined by CLC software. In addition, considering the relatively low number of fungal reads recovered from the assay in planta at 5 DAI, we have analyzed the most expressed genes in a given treatment considering the number of mapping reads per CDS normalized by scaling and CDS length. In this case, only genes mapped by at least one pair of reads in all three replicates were taken into account. We called these genes preferentially expressed (Table B in S8 File). The mapping levels of reads to genes preferentially expressed were between 6 and 10 times higher than the average number of reads mapped per CDS.  The number of preferentially expressed genes encoding secreted proteins is higher in planta (16) than in vitro (3). Among them, only two genes were in common to the two time points analyzed in planta (5 DAI and 200 DAI): the endoglucanase (g3790_chr09_Ss) and an uncharacterized secreted protein (g3890_chr10_Ss). Most of the genes considered preferentially expressed in vitro encode proteins related to energetic metabolism and growth, including an alternative oxidase (g2905_chr06_Ss), which is the most expressed, ATP-ADP carrier protein, elongation factor 1-alfa, polyubiquitin and several ribosomal proteins.  The results of the differentially expressed genes, obtained comparing each treatment in planta to the in vitro control, resulted in 125 genes detected at 5 DAI, of these 119 are up-regulated and six down-regulated in planta (Table C in S8 File). At 200 DAI 907 genes were detected as differentially expressed, of these 641 are up-regulated and 266 down-regulated (Table D in S8 File). GO terms assigned to down-regulated genes at 5 DAI are enriched in members of the mRNA binding functional group, and processes related to carbohydrate metabolism, oxidation-reduction and cellular respiration (Table E in S8 File). Up-regulated genes at 5 DAI are enriched in functions related to transporter activity and molecular/signal transduction (Table C in S8 File). At 200 DAI, the most enriched GO terms among down-regulated genes are oxidoreductase activity and mitochondrion cellular component. Up-regulated genes at 200 DAI are enriched with terms of hydrolase activity acting on glycosyl bonds and carbohydrate metabolic process (Table D in S8 File).  Among differentially expressed genes up-regulated in planta (5 and/or 200 DAI) 78 encode secreted proteins, some of them are related to host attack, nutrient acquisition and chitin modification. Table 2 summarizes the most relevant proteins detected as differentially expressed.  10.1371/journal.pone.0129318.t002  Table 2  List of selected differentially expressed genes up-regulated in planta.

Expressed only at 200 DAI are 131 genes: six of them (g5153_chr15_Ss, g5152_chr15_Ss, g5155_chr15_Ss, g3771_chr09_Ss, g4550_chr12_Ss, g3890_chr10_Ss) are also expressed at 5 DAI (Table F in S8 File), 108 encode proteins of unknown function, and 38 encode proteins of the secretome. The GO terms enrichment analysis revealed that extracellular region is the prevalent term. This set of 132 fungal genes is probably related to fungus/host interaction and may contain effectors associated with this singular interaction. Yet, the presence of one gene expressed particularly at 200 DAI encoding a secreted cysteine-protease inhibitor (g2337_chr05_Ss) may be related to the fungal defense against plant proteases. Eight of these genes have homologues in the PHI-base (Table G in S1 File), strengthening its involvement in S. scitamineum pathogenicity. For instance, mutations in U. maydis orthologs of genes g5161_chr15_Ss (PHI:932), g2659_chr06_Ss (PHI:910) and g3271_chr08_Ss (PHI:23) led to reduced virulence, and in the ortholog of g672_chr01_Ss (PHI:907) led to pathogenicity loss of the maize pathogen [7, 50].  The genome context of the genes expressed particularly in planta revealed the presence of ten islands in chromosomes 2, 6, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15 and 16 (Fig 6). Most of the genes are of uncharacterized function and encode secreted proteins ranging in size from 114 to 1257 amino acids. Mig1 related genes are in the chromosome 10 island and genes of the protein family Eff1 effectors are in an island of chromosome 11. Orthologous for 27 (22.9%) of these genes were not found in the genome of S. reilianum, the closest species, as well as in U. maydis and U. hordei, according to OrthoMCL analysis.  10.1371/journal.pone.0129318.g006  Fig 6  Chromosome segments representing the organization of genes in islands (color coded arrows and note colors beneath the bars).

Here, we describe an algorithm, Local Distribution of Short Sequences for Prokaryotes (LDSS-P), to identify conserved short motifs located at specific positions in the promoters of co-expressed prokaryotic genes. As a test case, we applied this algorithm to a symbiotic nitrogen-fixing bacterium, Sinorhizobium meliloti. The LDSS-P profiles that overlap with the 5′ section of the extracytoplasmic function RNA polymerase sigma factor RpoE2 consensus sequences displayed a sharp peak between -34 and -32 from TSS positions. The corresponding genes overlap significantly with RpoE2 targets identified from previous experiments. We further identified several groups of genes that are co-regulated with characterized marker genes. Our data indicate that in S. meliloti, and possibly in other Rhizobiaceae species, the master cell cycle regulator CtrA may recognize an expanded motif (AACCAT), which is positionally shifted from the previously reported CtrA consensus sequence in Caulobacter crescentus. Bacterial one-hybrid experiments showed that base substitution in the expanded motif either increase or decrease the binding by CtrA. These results show the effectiveness of LDSS-P as a method to delineate functional promoter elements.  ",FALSE,FALSE,

Organism referring to data?","  INTRODUCTION  Understanding promoter structures and deducing corresponding regulatory networks are major goals in genome biology. Prokaryotic promoters are relatively short (∼50 bp) sequences that provide a recognition site for RNA polymerase in association with a specific sigma factor (1), and thus define the site for transcription initiation. Most bacteria have multiple sigma factors that recognize distinct promoter sequences. A change in sigma factor results in a global change in transcription profile, and this mechanism is used by numerous bacteria as they adapt to changing environments. In addition, promoters are often adjacent to other DNA sequences that serve to bind transcription activators or repressors. These trans-acting proteins add another layer of regulation and may govern further networks of co-expressed genes.  Motif finding is an important step and major challenge to understand and predict promoter functions and regulations. Several approaches are used to predict functional motifs that are recognized by RNA polymerase sigma factors and other DNA binding proteins. Numerous algorithms have been developed during the last two decades. Das and Dai (2) comprehensively reviewed some representative algorithms and categorized into two major categories: (i) probabilistic sequence models where the model parameters are estimated using maximum-likelihood principle or Bayesian inference and (ii) word-based (string-based) approaches that often rely on counting and comparing oligonucleotide frequencies. These algorithms often require pre-grouping or ‘enrichment’ of genes as input. To assemble the set of input sequences, one may use DNA microarray- and RNA sequencing-based transcriptome profiling to reveal genes showing parallel expression, or use chromatin immunoprecipitation and systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) to define DNA sequences with affinity for specific proteins. Such sets of experimentally derived sequences are then analyzed with a probabilistic algorithm.  In some cases, however, there may be little or no pre-existing evidence to characterize all genes, or all expression conditions, especially for non-model systems. In such cases, a consensus-independent method (one that does not require prior knowledge about the targets) may be useful for predicting regulatory networks. Local distribution of short sequences (LDSS) (3) is a de novo motif-finding algorithm based on the presumed presence of conserved short (6–8 mer) sequences in cis to transcription start sites. This algorithm assumes that a functional short sequence, such as an RNA polymerase sigma factor binding site, must be located at a certain defined position in the promoter for its functionality. In the case of eukaryotic promoters, examples are the TATA box and binding sites for NRF-1, SP1, CREB, ATF and E2F (3,4). The original LDSS algorithm has proved to be a simple and powerful method for extracting possible functional short motifs without any knowledge about the genes in a promoter data set, and has been used to analyze and characterize a large number of promoters from plants and animals. A similar algorithm has been included in PEAKS positional footprinting server (5). It supports the analysis of significant motif positional biases up to 6-mer sequences, however, it does not support longer oligomers or combination of 2 or more nucleotides at a position. Also, the PEAKS program is not capable of analyzing large-scale data sets: it is a web-based tool, and it is cumbersome to integrate a systematic data mining process based on the identified candidates using this web program. The original LDSS algorithm has not been tested on prokaryotic promoters. Also, it does not provide a general way to evaluate computationally which genes among the large initial number of mathematically equivalent localized motif peaks are likely co-regulated in a real living system. We have developed an improved algorithm, named LDSS-P, that identifies conserved short motifs that are shared in the promoters of unselected gene sets and in large transcriptome data sets, and is able to evaluate whether these groups of genes are actually co-regulated in the organism. That is, the new algorithm captures both motif-position similarity, and co-expression probability, in a single numerical outcome. This allows one computational approach rather than first identifying all the sets of co-regulated genes, with a subsequent and separate search for shared motifs. A combined spatial and co-expression calculation presents significant challenges for computation time. We made changes to the original LDSS algorithm so we can test all possible 2 to 4 nucleotide combinations that are represented by IUPAC ambiguity codes (6) at each location, thus streamlining the initial comparison processes. Also, LDSS-P employs threading and discretization (modification of variable granularity) to allow parallel computation; this allows efficient calculation using multi-core CPUs and large distributed computing resources such as PC clusters and cloud computing. The LDSS-P program employs a Map-Reduce strategy and the ‘prefix’ parameter function to calculate each unique specified nucleotide space.  In the present paper, we validated the effectiveness of the LDSS (position information) and LDSS-P (position and co-expression) algorithms in bacteria using the plant symbiotic nitrogen-fixing bacterium Sinorhizobium meliloti as the model. We identified several groups of genes that share a short motif at a particular position with respect to mapped 5′ transcription start sites, and that are co-regulated in large scale transcriptome data sets. Our informatics analysis and follow-up experimental data indicate that the cell cycle regulator CtrA may recognize an expanded motif shifted from its previously reported consensus.  ",FALSE,TRUE,

The 5′ TSS-enriched library was created from RNA samples representing 16 different growth and stress conditions (Supplementary Table S1); this set did not include samples from nitrogen-fixing nodules. It is anticipated that because many genes are co-transcribed in operons, the number of TSS will be substantially lower than the number of annotated genes (9). A matrix that contains the count of mapped TSS reads at each position was created for each of the 3 replicons. Locations with fewer than 25 mapped TSS sites were removed from the matrix. Using the refined matrices, we employed Savitsky–Golay's smoothing differentiation with 8-point convolution (10) to identify significant TSS peaks by removing random spikes. Although some S. meliloti genes have long 5′ untranslated regions, a TSS peak was assigned to a gene only when an identified peak located within 150 bp from the 5′ end nucleotide of a coding sequence (CDS) to be sure a TSS is not mistakenly assigned to an unrelated CDS. In the event two or more TSS peaks were found within the 150 bp, all TSS peaks were included for later analyses, except for those with a read count lower than 20% and/or those located within a 50 bp radius of the highest peak. In the present study, we focused on the most accurate TSSs; these were assigned to 2217 out of 6235 annotated CDS. The non-redundant promoter and 5′-UTR data set (‘promoter data set’ hereafter) was then created by extracting the 100 bp upstream and 50 bp downstream sequences from each TSS.  LDSS-P analysis  The LDSS-P approach includes two components: LDSS (position) and co-expression analyses. All the programs described here are available through our website (http://cmgm.stanford.edu/biology/long/files/ichida2016/LDSS-P_dist.zip).  LDSS calculation  LDSS analysis was carried out with a combination of C++ programs incorporating the algorithm described in the previous paper (3). All programs were compiled using Intel C++ compiler version 11.1.059 (Intel, Santa Clara, CA, USA) and were run on a Linux PC cluster (Fujitsu Primergy RX200 S5, Intel Xeon X5570 2.93 GHz processors, 12 GB memory, CentOS 5.4, 48 nodes, 384 cores in total). All possible hexamer sequences were searched for possible placement in each sequence position in the promoter data set (described above). In addition to the standard four nucleotides, combinations of all 2 and 3 nucleotide possibilities were included for positions 2–5 within the hexamer. The possible number of ambiguous nucleotides for any one site is not limited in the present analysis, thus exact matches and corresponding ambiguous hexamers are all counted. For example, we established a set of all occurrences of the hexamer ATGCAT. We also formed a set of all sequences AWGCAT and AHGCAT, where W can be either T or A, and H can be T, A, or C (or ‘not-G’), and so on (6) for all 2 and 3 nucleotide combinations in positions 2–5. In order to assure the effective motif length and specificity at the border, ambiguity codes were not permitted at position 1 and 6. This allowed incorporation of ambiguity in the first pass of the search. The occurrence of the hexamer sequences was counted for each nucleotide position relative to the TSS. A running moving average was computed with a bin of 5 bp, and used to identify localized motif peaks, which would indicate a sequence position where a motif is significantly localized. The average count (height) divided by standard deviation of counts at all possible genome positions within the start-site database was designated as ‘fold standard deviation’ (FSD). The left and right borders of a peak were adjusted to maximize FSD within the range of 5 bp upstream and downstream from that sequence position. All localized motif peaks were loaded into a data set that included for each entry: the sequence; left- and right-border positions; peak height; and average height within and outside of the peak. For motifs found by incorporating ambiguity, the best corresponding ATGC-only peak (that with the highest FSD) was annotated as the representative ATGC-only motif.  Co-expression analysis  A gene expression vector was created from 261 SymbiosisChip transcriptome results from 24 projects (described in Results and Supplementary Table S1). Hybridization signals were normalized for each project using the RMA method (11). The normalized values were combined for each gene to create global expression vectors. Distance between two genes X and Y was defined as (1 - Pearson's linear correlation coefficient), and is expressed by following equation:  \documentclass[12pt]{minimal}  \usepackage{amsmath}  \usepackage{wasysym}   \usepackage{amsfonts}   \usepackage{amssymb}   \usepackage{amsbsy}  \usepackage{upgreek}  \usepackage{mathrsfs}  \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}  \begin{document}  }{}\begin{equation*}D(x,y) = 1 - \frac{1}{{n - 1}}\mathop \sum \limits_{i = 1}^n \left( {\frac{{{X_{\rm i}} - \bar X}}{{{S_{X}}}}} \right)\left( {\frac{{{Y_{\rm i}} - \bar Y}}{{{S_{Y}}}}} \right)\end{equation*}\end{document}  Where sX and sY denotes standard deviation of all hybridization signals from gene X and Y, respectively. Distances between pairwise combinations of all 6091 annotated S. meliloti genes on the SymbiosisChip were calculated.  To identify localized motif peaks corresponding to genes with analogous (the direction and level of increase/decrease is similar) transcription patterns, we calculated the distances from all possible pairwise combinations of genes in that peak (a peak reflects a group of genes having the motif at one particular position from TSS). As a control, the same number of genes was randomly chosen from the entire database set, and from these a distance population was constructed. A Mann–Whitney U test was used to determine whether the pairwise distance between the genes in a peak was significantly different from pairwise distances for a randomly chosen population. The test was repeated 1000 times with different random populations. For these data, the P-value represents the percentage of trials that were not significant.  Pathway representation and matrix-based motif discovery using MEME to identify additional conserved motifs  The annotations of S. meliloti 1021 genes were obtained from the EnsemblBacteria database Release 21 (12). Genes were mapped to the reference pathways using a public KEGG automatic annotation server version 1.6a (http://www.genome.jp/tools/kaas/). Each LDSS-P positive peak was subjected to statistical representation analysis against each one of the pathways using the ‘representation’ program. Briefly, the representation factor was defined as the number of overlapping genes divided by the expected number of overlapping genes drawn from an LDSS-P positive peak and all 2650 genes in the promoter data set. The representation factor and the hypergeometric probability was calculated according to a previous report (13). LDSS-P positive peaks with the highest representation factor were subjected to a search with MEME analysis to find extended conserved motifs in the promoter. The ‘nr_prom’ is a program to create the input promoter sequences from a LDSS-P positive peak. MEME Suite software Version 4.9.1 patch1 (compiled from source code; (14)) was used to identify conserved motifs within a set of promoters with options (settings: -dna -maxsize 60 000 -mod zoops -nmotifs 3 -minw 6 -maxw 50 -revcomp).  Bacterial one-hybrid assay  The omega-based bacterial one-hybrid (B1H) assay was carried out as described (15). The plasmids pB1H2w2-zif268 (Plasmid #18045) and pH3U3-zif268 (Plasmid #18046) were obtained from Addgene (Cambridge, MA, USA). An attR1-ChroramphenicolR-ccdB-attR2 cassette (Gateway vector conversion system, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) was introduced in frame between KpnI and XbaI sites of pB1H2w2-zif268 to create a Gateway-compatible derivative, pHiS577. The coding sequence of ctrA (SMc00654) and the flanking two attP sites were amplified from the Gateway ORFeome library (16) with primers HI571 (TCGCGTTAACGCTAGCATGGATCTC) and HI572, and subjected to a Gateway LR reaction. A D51E mutation was introduced to ctrA by site-directed mutagenesis with primers HI939 (GGTTCAGTTCGAGGAGAATGATGTCG) and HI940 (TCCTCGAACTGAACCTGCCGGACAT) using a CloneEZ PCR cloning kit (GenScript, Piscataway, NJ, USA). The resulting plasmid was designated pHiS636. To construct reporter fusions, a 45 bp sequence containing the CtrA binding motif in the upstream region of ctrA-P2 promoter (17) was used as the scaffold. Two oligonucleotides (TACACCCGGGCGGCC TCGATACACCTTGCCAGAGTGAATCAGAATTTGTTAACCATTTGGCGAATTCTTTACACTTT and its complementary sequence; the underline denotes the TTAACCMT motif identified by LDSS-P and the first and last 15 bp are homologous to pH3U3-zif268 for CloneEZ reaction) were synthesized, dissolved at 100 μM in TE buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0) containing 50 mM sodium chloride, and heat denatured at 95°C for 5 min, then gradually cooled down to room temperature. The resulting double-stranded fragment was cloned between NotI and EcoRI sites of pH3U3-zif268 by CloneEZ. Plasmids with a base substitution on and adjacent to the TTAACCMT motif were created in similar way.  To test the interaction between RpoZ-CtrA(D51E) fusion and the CtrA binding motifs, Escherichia coli US0 (hisB− pyrF− rpoZ−; Addgene #18049) was transformed with pHiS577 and pHiS636 or its mutated derivatives. The overnight culture was washed twice with 10 mM magnesium sulfate and spotted on M9 plates supplemented with 0.2% D-glucose, 2.5 μg/ml thiamine hydrochloride, 50 μg/ml ampicillin and 25 μg/ml kanamycin, and incubated at 30°C for 2 days. LB plates containing the same antibiotics were used as control. Digital images of the plates were taken using a ChemiDoc MP (Bio-rad) under epi-white illumination.  ",TRUE,TRUE,"This one is hard.

PMC4914127,RESULTS AND DISCUSSION,Results and Discussion,AE006469,1,0,0,,"SEE ARTICLE COMMENT ""We annotated the S. meliloti 1021 genome with the most significant 4606 LDSS-P positive motifs relative to the corresponding TSS locations""","  RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  Improved LDSS analysis identifies sequence motifs in bacteria  Previously, hexamer and octamer sequences were shown to work well for LDSS analysis in eukaryotes (4). We used hexamer searches as a starting point for LDSS-P analysis in prokaryotes. For each hexamer sequence, a distribution profile in relation to distance from the TSS was analyzed at a global scale in S. meliloti. This analysis produced 614 656 (42 [combinations of A, C, G, and T at position 1 and 6] × 144 [the 4 nucleotides and the ambiguity codes representing the mixture of 2 (6 codes) and 3 (4 codes) nucleotides at positions 2–5]) distribution profiles with 2 797 994 possible localized motif peaks. Of all possible hexamer motifs, there were 17 970 (0.64%) localized motif peaks containing motifs with no ambiguity codes. The distribution of localized motif peaks is shown in Figure 1. Localized motif peaks were observed most often at 4 major regions: around −95, −40, −15 and +4 from TSS. The regions near −40 and −15 likely correspond to the conserved −35 and −10 regions recognized by prokaryotic sigma factors. The number of genes within the peak (integration) ranged from 2 to 1735 (126.50 ± 115.12; average ± standard deviation). The FSD (see Materials and Methods) ranged from 0.30 to 23.25 (2.49 ± 0.88; average ± standard deviation). Sequence distribution peaks that showed a higher FSD were more symmetrical and well separated from background (data not shown). Localized motif peaks with ambiguity nucleotide codes were assigned to sub-groups based on the peak locations and FSD in their corresponding ATGC-only motif sequences. For example, a grouping process for the AGRACA (R indicates A or G) peak compares the FSD values of corresponding peaks in AGAACA and AGGACA, and designates a unique group identifier consisting of the ATGC-only motif sequence and the left and right border positions of the peak (e.g. AGGACA_−59_−50). This grouping is particularly useful since introducing ambiguity to a motif increases the combination of nucleotides by an order of magnitude and thus would make it more difficult to find the most representative groups from the large number of peaks with similar nucleotide sequences. This grouping information makes it easier to identify the most significant localized motifs from a large variety of similar motifs with ambiguity.  Figure 1.  Distribution of localized motif peak positions. Values along the vertical axis represent cumulative occurrence of LDSS (×) and LDSS-P (•) positive pentamer and hexamer peaks at each position along the horizontal axis. The criteria to identify localized motif (by LDSS) and co-expressed (LDSS-P) peaks are described in the text. Localized motifs identified by LDSS and LDSS-P positive peaks lay in specific regions: for LDSS, peaks tended to occur at around −95, −40, −15, and +4 from TSS; for LDSS-P, peaks typically occurred at around −40 and −15.  We tested whether the improved LDSS algorithm can identify known −35 and −10 motifs with reasonable sensitivity. RpoE2 is an RNA polymerase ECF sigma factor that is responsible for activating the transcription of general stress response genes in S. meliloti. The target genes of RpoE2 have a consensus sequence of GGAAC-N15/16-gcgTTt (lowercase characters indicate less conservation) in their promoters (18). The LDSS profiles of GGAACA, GGAACC, GGAACG and GGAACT, which partly overlaps the −35 motif of the RpoE2 promoter consensus, is shown in Figure 2. The LDSS-P algorithm detected major peaks between −36 and −32 (consisted from 37 genes, FSD 7.621), −36 and −28 (27 genes, FSD 3.376) and −35 and −32 (20 genes, FSD 5.323) from GGAAA, GGAACC and GGAACT, respectively. No significant localized peak was detected from GGAACG. The total number of unique genes in these 3 peaks was 84. We compared these 84 genes with the significantly induced genes by RpoE2 overexpression identified by transcriptome analysis using microarrays (7). Of the 87 genes that were increased more than 2-fold by RpoE2 overexpression and with at least 1 TSS assigned in our promoter data set, 54 were found in the GGAAC(A/C/T) peaks; this represented 62.1% of the gene sets. The transcriptome results should include both direct and indirect targets of RpoE2-polymerase. Our results showed strong matching with the RpoE2-overexpression data, and indicate that almost 2/3 of the implied target genes are directly controlled by RpoE2. This analysis showed that LDSS can identify conserved functional motifs from a set of unclassified bacterial promoters without an instruction set or prior knowledge of targets.  Figure 2.

The vertical axis indicates the total number of promoters with the motif. The horizontal axis indicates relative position from the transcription start site (position at 0 corresponds to the TSS). Crosses (×) and filled circles (•) indicate raw count and running average, respectively, within a 5 bp window.  Global LDSS-P analysis of S. meliloti  We used a large set of global transcription data for S. meliloti to identify localized motif peaks associated with coordinated transcription. These transcriptomic data were generated using the SymbiosisChip, a custom Affymetrix microarray platform (19), and are all based on comparison between appropriate wild-type and/or empty vector controls and the test construct or condition. These data sets include tests for function of numerous regulatory proteins (Supplementary Table S1).  We created a gene distance matrix by calculating the distance (1 - Pearson's linear correlation coefficient) of normalized signal intensity between all possible pairwise combinations of S. meliloti genes from every test condition. We calculated the distances of all possible pairwise combinations of genes within a peak; treated it as a population; and statistically asked (using a non-parametric Mann–Whitney U test) if a set of genes grouped by LDSS has a significantly closer distance population than that of a randomly chosen group of the same number of sequences (P < 0.05). For each peak, we repeated this test 1000 times with different sets of randomly selected genes to evaluate the robustness of the grouping and calculated a functional P-value, which is the percentage of trials in which the two distance populations showed no significant statistical difference between the LDSS-grouped peak and randomly selected genes. We focused on LDSS peaks with 5 or more genes to obtain a reasonable number of groups. We selected 241 918 peaks (8.65% of all peaks in the previous step) which had an uncorrected functional P-value less than 0.05: these peaks were categorized as LDSS-P positive. The genes corresponding to these LDSS-P positive peaks not only share a hexamer motif at a specific position in promoters but also show similar expression patterns (increase and decrease). Figure 1 shows the distribution of LDSS-P positive motifs that are shared within a group of genes expressed in parallel (note filled circles). We observed two major peaks centered at −39 and −15. Almost all of the peaks upstream of −50 and downstream of −10, including the two peaks near −95 and +4 in the previous step, were rejected after expression pattern-based screening. We implemented a program (‘extract_best_peak_by_distance’) to pick the best LDSS-P positive peaks, namely those with the shortest average distance among each ATGC-only motif group (described above). The process efficiently removed multiple similar ambiguous motifs which might be derived from the same ATGC-only functional element (data not shown). This process selected 4905 most representative peaks from the 103 558 LDSS-P positive peaks, and these peaks are subjected to the pathway representation analysis.  It is a challenging and labor intensive task to narrow down and identify motifs that are shared within a particular group of genes from a large number of LDSS-P positive peaks, even after the grouping process described above. As a test case for the identification of functional hexamer motifs corresponding to a particular groups of genes, we statistically analyzed the correlation between LDSS-P positive peaks and metabolic and signaling pathways. We chose KEGG pathway as the reference because it is one of the most comprehensive, well structured, and generally applicable pathway information data sets (20). We applied a statistical analysis which uses the representation factor (defined as the number of detected overlapping genes divided by the expected number of overlapping genes drawn from two independent peaks, and its hypergeometric probability; (13)) to identify LDSS-P positive motifs which are significantly over-represented in the pathway of interest. The strongest LDSS-P positive peaks (see above) were searched for representation against each of the 148 KEGG pathways, and motifs with hypergeometric probability of less than 0.05 were considered to be significant. Table 1 shows examples of the most significant LDSS-P positive peaks corresponding to KEGG pathways. For each of these, there were four or fewer potential motif sequences (as determined in the previous calculation) so as to avoid too much ambiguity.  Table 1.

AACCAT may represent an extended CtrA binding motif  As shown in Table 1, a TTWAMC (W and M indicate A/T and A/C, respectively) motif was significantly over-represented at between −36 and −27 from TSS among the cell-cycle regulation pathway genes (ccr04112). We chose this pathway as a model because it is well characterized, and the mechanism and genes for cell cycle regulation are highly conserved in α-proteobacteria. The pathway was drawn based on the findings in Caulobacter crescentus. The KAAS program identified 30 orthologous genes in S. meliloti, and these genes include the essential master cell cycle transcriptional regulators dnaA, gcrA and ctrA and an essential cell-cycle regulated DNA methyltransferase ccrM (21). There were 48 genes in this LDSS-P positive peak in our promoter data set (Supplementary Table S2). We used the promoter sequence of these 48 genes and MEME program to identify the conserved nucleotide motifs that spanned outside the identified TTWAMC motif. The sequence logo (22), which visualizes nucleotide conservation at each position by MEME analysis, is shown in Figure 3.  Figure 3.  Conserved nucleotides in TTWAMC group. The sequence conservation for the TTWAMC motif found at between −37 and −25 from TSS in the S. meliloti database. The nucleotide representation logo was generated using MEME as described in Materials and Methods. The height of each nucleotide in the logo represents the conservation of the nucleotide at each position.  The analysis revealed that there were additional highly conserved nucleotides in two places upstream and downstream of the identified TTWAMC motif: an adenine and thymine (AT) were immediately adjacent to the 3′ end of TTWAMC, plus 5 nt upstream we observed a second motif, GTTAACC. The TTAACC part of the GTTAACC motif was marked positive by the proposed LDSS-P criterion (22 genes; an uncorrected functional P-value of 0.004 for TTAACC between −80 and −77). In contrast, the GTTAAC was not captured due to dissimilar expression patterns (0.129 for GTTAAC between −84 and −78). It is most likely that because LDSS-P relies on the localization of relatively short k-mers, some of such sequences are too common among the promoters or genomic sequences due to the organisms GC bias and other nucleotide preferences. In such a case, it would not be possible to distinguish significant localizations from such background noise.  We found the overall conserved motif (GTTAACC-N5-TTWAMCAT) shows overlap with the reported consensus sequence of CtrA binding motif (TTAA-N7-TTAA; (23)). CtrA is an essential transcriptional regulator that coordinates DNA replication, cell division and polar morphogenesis, and is considered the master cell cycle regulator in α-proteobacteria (24). In S. meliloti, phosphorylated CtrA binds to a consensus sequence TAA-N7-TTAAC based on the analysis in the promoter region of ctrA (17). We hypothesized that the AACCAT is a part of an extended CtrA binding motif.  We tested this hypothesis by asking whether a point mutation in the AACCAT motif changes interaction with CtrA, using a bacterial one-hybrid assay as a reporter for protein–DNA binding. A translational fusion with an RNA polymerase ω subunit, RpoZ, and a constitutively active D51E mutant of S. meliloti CtrA was created and used to determine the interaction between CtrA (D51E) and its binding motifs (with the extended AACCAT sequence). We created a set of pH3U3-derivative plasmids, containing wild-type or mutagenized CtrA binding motifs upstream of ura and pyrF genes driven by a weak minimal promoter elements. In this system, histidine and uracil auxotrophy in the host E. coli strain US0 is (25–29) complemented only when the CtrA (D51E) protein fused with RpoZ binds to the motif. This allows binding of an RNA polymerase holoenzyme to the −35/−10 region of the weak promoter, so transcription can initiate. The degree of complementation (ura and pyrF expression) reflects the stability of interaction between the protein and DNA. We confirmed that the D51E mutation results in enhanced binding to the CtrA binding motif (data not shown). The interactions of CtrA (D51E) with wild-type versus 12 different mutagenized CtrA binding motifs, and with zif268 (the binding sequence of a well characterized zinc-finger transcriptional factor, Zif268, as a negative control; (30)) are shown in Figure 4. The T2C (the second thymine in the TTAACCAT motif was substituted to cytosine), A4G, C5T, C6G, A7G and T8C mutations caused significant loss of CtrA binding, whereas T1C, A3G and C6A did not alter the binding. The C6T mutation caused better binding of CtrA, suggesting that the C6 position is an important determinant for CtrA binding affinity. Unexpectedly, one of the mutations at the flanks of the motif, a thymine to cytosine transversion at 3 bp upstream of the motif (Mut1), resulted in better binding, comparable to that of the C6T (Mut7) mutation. These results reveal that the expanded CAT and the upstream regions in addition to the previously identified TTAAC motif influence the binding of CtrA. Here, LDSS-P analysis was effective in identifying novel functional motifs in promoters in S. meliloti, and we propose it can be used similarly for other bacteria.  Figure 4.  Bacterial one-hybrid assay of CtrA (D51E) and mutated CtrA binding motifs. At left, sequences for mutants 1–12 are shown underneath the newly proposed CtrA binding consensus. Degree of binding is summarized to the right of each sequence (from − for no binding to +++ for the strongest binding). At right, growth of cells on M9 minimal medium or LB rich medium due to successful binding of CtrA to the motif for each mutant.  The combination of LDSS-P plus other matrix-based motif finding tools is very powerful because LDSS-P is tolerant to unrelated promoters that may be present in the input promoter set, thanks to its principle that focuses on the occurrence of short k-mers, and can increase the sensitivity to find less conserved motifs in the subsequent analysis.  Annotation of motifs in the S. meliloti genome with LDSS-P  We noted some groups of genes within LDSS-P peaks that empirically showed similarity in their gene expression patterns. Among the short nucleotide motifs that LDSS found at certain defined distances from TSS, there were two groups: (i) motifs determining transcriptional specificity, which are LDSS-P positive peaks near −39 and −15, consistent with previous reports in rhizobia (7,31) and with the canonical model for the σ70 promoter sequence (a hexamer at −35 separated by 15–21 nucleotide from the −10 hexamer in E. coli; (32)); and (ii) sequences corresponding to peaks at −95 and +4 from the TSS. We infer that these peaks at −95 and +4 are not primarily involved in transcriptional control, at least in the conditions covered by our transcriptome data sets, because these groups of genes did not show significant co-expression in the transcriptional data sets, thus rejected by LDSS-P analysis. We asked whether the peak at +4 is due to nucleotide bias from start codons which are located within 6 nucleotides of the TSS, however, we found only 12 of such genes in our promoter data set. Therefore, it is unlikely that these peaks are the bias from start codons located near TSS. Another possible explanation for the +4 peak would be a result of nucleotide preference in transcriptional initiation by RNA polymerase. In considering the peak at −90, we note the report that in E. coli, a flexibly tethered alpha subunit C-terminal domain, which recognizes the upstream sequence of the −35 element, can bind non-specifically to more distant DNA sequences, making contacts up to −90 from TSS (33). It is also possible that −95 and +4 peaks influence binding of other regulators, and/or affect other levels of gene expression control.  Recent advances in genome sequencing technology have enabled rapid acquisition of bacterial whole genome sequences. Since orthologous DNA binding proteins and their target nucleotide sequences are expected to be well conserved between phylogenetically related organisms, we propose that LDSS-P positive peaks in a model organism are likely to be functional in other related species. Indeed, these short motifs may be better conserved than the TSS themselves, due to the selective pressure from motif functionality in protein binding. Therefore, the transcriptional regulatory networks identified in a model organism can be efficiently transferred into non-model species by converting raw TSS locations into LDSS-P positive motifs.  We annotated the S. meliloti 1021 genome with the most significant 4606 LDSS-P positive motifs relative to the corresponding TSS locations. This produced more than 88 000 annotations for the promoter regions of previously annotated coding sequences: each annotation indicates the corresponding LDSS-positive motif; relative distance from TSS; the representing ATGC-only motif peak; and statistical evaluations.

PMC4914127,Abstract,Abstract,AL591688,1,0,0,,Organism referring to data?,"  Abstract  Identifying functional elements in promoter sequences is a major goal in computational and experimental genome biology. Here, we describe an algorithm, Local Distribution of Short Sequences for Prokaryotes (LDSS-P), to identify conserved short motifs located at specific positions in the promoters of co-expressed prokaryotic genes. As a test case, we applied this algorithm to a symbiotic nitrogen-fixing bacterium, Sinorhizobium meliloti. The LDSS-P profiles that overlap with the 5′ section of the extracytoplasmic function RNA polymerase sigma factor RpoE2 consensus sequences displayed a sharp peak between -34 and -32 from TSS positions. The corresponding genes overlap significantly with RpoE2 targets identified from previous experiments. We further identified several groups of genes that are co-regulated with characterized marker genes. Our data indicate that in S. meliloti, and possibly in other Rhizobiaceae species, the master cell cycle regulator CtrA may recognize an expanded motif (AACCAT), which is positionally shifted from the previously reported CtrA consensus sequence in Caulobacter crescentus. Bacterial one-hybrid experiments showed that base substitution in the expanded motif either increase or decrease the binding by CtrA. These results show the effectiveness of LDSS-P as a method to delineate functional promoter elements.  ",FALSE,FALSE,

Organism referring to data?","  INTRODUCTION  Understanding promoter structures and deducing corresponding regulatory networks are major goals in genome biology. Prokaryotic promoters are relatively short (∼50 bp) sequences that provide a recognition site for RNA polymerase in association with a specific sigma factor (1), and thus define the site for transcription initiation. Most bacteria have multiple sigma factors that recognize distinct promoter sequences. A change in sigma factor results in a global change in transcription profile, and this mechanism is used by numerous bacteria as they adapt to changing environments. In addition, promoters are often adjacent to other DNA sequences that serve to bind transcription activators or repressors. These trans-acting proteins add another layer of regulation and may govern further networks of co-expressed genes.  Motif finding is an important step and major challenge to understand and predict promoter functions and regulations. Several approaches are used to predict functional motifs that are recognized by RNA polymerase sigma factors and other DNA binding proteins. Numerous algorithms have been developed during the last two decades. Das and Dai (2) comprehensively reviewed some representative algorithms and categorized into two major categories: (i) probabilistic sequence models where the model parameters are estimated using maximum-likelihood principle or Bayesian inference and (ii) word-based (string-based) approaches that often rely on counting and comparing oligonucleotide frequencies. These algorithms often require pre-grouping or ‘enrichment’ of genes as input. To assemble the set of input sequences, one may use DNA microarray- and RNA sequencing-based transcriptome profiling to reveal genes showing parallel expression, or use chromatin immunoprecipitation and systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) to define DNA sequences with affinity for specific proteins. Such sets of experimentally derived sequences are then analyzed with a probabilistic algorithm.  In some cases, however, there may be little or no pre-existing evidence to characterize all genes, or all expression conditions, especially for non-model systems. In such cases, a consensus-independent method (one that does not require prior knowledge about the targets) may be useful for predicting regulatory networks. Local distribution of short sequences (LDSS) (3) is a de novo motif-finding algorithm based on the presumed presence of conserved short (6–8 mer) sequences in cis to transcription start sites. This algorithm assumes that a functional short sequence, such as an RNA polymerase sigma factor binding site, must be located at a certain defined position in the promoter for its functionality. In the case of eukaryotic promoters, examples are the TATA box and binding sites for NRF-1, SP1, CREB, ATF and E2F (3,4). The original LDSS algorithm has proved to be a simple and powerful method for extracting possible functional short motifs without any knowledge about the genes in a promoter data set, and has been used to analyze and characterize a large number of promoters from plants and animals. A similar algorithm has been included in PEAKS positional footprinting server (5). It supports the analysis of significant motif positional biases up to 6-mer sequences, however, it does not support longer oligomers or combination of 2 or more nucleotides at a position. Also, the PEAKS program is not capable of analyzing large-scale data sets: it is a web-based tool, and it is cumbersome to integrate a systematic data mining process based on the identified candidates using this web program. The original LDSS algorithm has not been tested on prokaryotic promoters. Also, it does not provide a general way to evaluate computationally which genes among the large initial number of mathematically equivalent localized motif peaks are likely co-regulated in a real living system. We have developed an improved algorithm, named LDSS-P, that identifies conserved short motifs that are shared in the promoters of unselected gene sets and in large transcriptome data sets, and is able to evaluate whether these groups of genes are actually co-regulated in the organism. That is, the new algorithm captures both motif-position similarity, and co-expression probability, in a single numerical outcome. This allows one computational approach rather than first identifying all the sets of co-regulated genes, with a subsequent and separate search for shared motifs. A combined spatial and co-expression calculation presents significant challenges for computation time. We made changes to the original LDSS algorithm so we can test all possible 2 to 4 nucleotide combinations that are represented by IUPAC ambiguity codes (6) at each location, thus streamlining the initial comparison processes. Also, LDSS-P employs threading and discretization (modification of variable granularity) to allow parallel computation; this allows efficient calculation using multi-core CPUs and large distributed computing resources such as PC clusters and cloud computing. The LDSS-P program employs a Map-Reduce strategy and the ‘prefix’ parameter function to calculate each unique specified nucleotide space.  In the present paper, we validated the effectiveness of the LDSS (position information) and LDSS-P (position and co-expression) algorithms in bacteria using the plant symbiotic nitrogen-fixing bacterium Sinorhizobium meliloti as the model. We identified several groups of genes that share a short motif at a particular position with respect to mapped 5′ transcription start sites, and that are co-regulated in large scale transcriptome data sets. Our informatics analysis and follow-up experimental data indicate that the cell cycle regulator CtrA may recognize an expanded motif shifted from its previously reported consensus.  ",FALSE,TRUE,

The 5′ TSS-enriched library was created from RNA samples representing 16 different growth and stress conditions (Supplementary Table S1); this set did not include samples from nitrogen-fixing nodules. It is anticipated that because many genes are co-transcribed in operons, the number of TSS will be substantially lower than the number of annotated genes (9). A matrix that contains the count of mapped TSS reads at each position was created for each of the 3 replicons. Locations with fewer than 25 mapped TSS sites were removed from the matrix. Using the refined matrices, we employed Savitsky–Golay's smoothing differentiation with 8-point convolution (10) to identify significant TSS peaks by removing random spikes. Although some S. meliloti genes have long 5′ untranslated regions, a TSS peak was assigned to a gene only when an identified peak located within 150 bp from the 5′ end nucleotide of a coding sequence (CDS) to be sure a TSS is not mistakenly assigned to an unrelated CDS. In the event two or more TSS peaks were found within the 150 bp, all TSS peaks were included for later analyses, except for those with a read count lower than 20% and/or those located within a 50 bp radius of the highest peak. In the present study, we focused on the most accurate TSSs; these were assigned to 2217 out of 6235 annotated CDS. The non-redundant promoter and 5′-UTR data set (‘promoter data set’ hereafter) was then created by extracting the 100 bp upstream and 50 bp downstream sequences from each TSS.  LDSS-P analysis  The LDSS-P approach includes two components: LDSS (position) and co-expression analyses. All the programs described here are available through our website (http://cmgm.stanford.edu/biology/long/files/ichida2016/LDSS-P_dist.zip).  LDSS calculation  LDSS analysis was carried out with a combination of C++ programs incorporating the algorithm described in the previous paper (3). All programs were compiled using Intel C++ compiler version 11.1.059 (Intel, Santa Clara, CA, USA) and were run on a Linux PC cluster (Fujitsu Primergy RX200 S5, Intel Xeon X5570 2.93 GHz processors, 12 GB memory, CentOS 5.4, 48 nodes, 384 cores in total). All possible hexamer sequences were searched for possible placement in each sequence position in the promoter data set (described above). In addition to the standard four nucleotides, combinations of all 2 and 3 nucleotide possibilities were included for positions 2–5 within the hexamer. The possible number of ambiguous nucleotides for any one site is not limited in the present analysis, thus exact matches and corresponding ambiguous hexamers are all counted. For example, we established a set of all occurrences of the hexamer ATGCAT. We also formed a set of all sequences AWGCAT and AHGCAT, where W can be either T or A, and H can be T, A, or C (or ‘not-G’), and so on (6) for all 2 and 3 nucleotide combinations in positions 2–5. In order to assure the effective motif length and specificity at the border, ambiguity codes were not permitted at position 1 and 6. This allowed incorporation of ambiguity in the first pass of the search. The occurrence of the hexamer sequences was counted for each nucleotide position relative to the TSS. A running moving average was computed with a bin of 5 bp, and used to identify localized motif peaks, which would indicate a sequence position where a motif is significantly localized. The average count (height) divided by standard deviation of counts at all possible genome positions within the start-site database was designated as ‘fold standard deviation’ (FSD). The left and right borders of a peak were adjusted to maximize FSD within the range of 5 bp upstream and downstream from that sequence position. All localized motif peaks were loaded into a data set that included for each entry: the sequence; left- and right-border positions; peak height; and average height within and outside of the peak. For motifs found by incorporating ambiguity, the best corresponding ATGC-only peak (that with the highest FSD) was annotated as the representative ATGC-only motif.  Co-expression analysis  A gene expression vector was created from 261 SymbiosisChip transcriptome results from 24 projects (described in Results and Supplementary Table S1). Hybridization signals were normalized for each project using the RMA method (11). The normalized values were combined for each gene to create global expression vectors. Distance between two genes X and Y was defined as (1 - Pearson's linear correlation coefficient), and is expressed by following equation:  \documentclass[12pt]{minimal}  \usepackage{amsmath}  \usepackage{wasysym}   \usepackage{amsfonts}   \usepackage{amssymb}   \usepackage{amsbsy}  \usepackage{upgreek}  \usepackage{mathrsfs}  \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}  \begin{document}  }{}\begin{equation*}D(x,y) = 1 - \frac{1}{{n - 1}}\mathop \sum \limits_{i = 1}^n \left( {\frac{{{X_{\rm i}} - \bar X}}{{{S_{X}}}}} \right)\left( {\frac{{{Y_{\rm i}} - \bar Y}}{{{S_{Y}}}}} \right)\end{equation*}\end{document}  Where sX and sY denotes standard deviation of all hybridization signals from gene X and Y, respectively. Distances between pairwise combinations of all 6091 annotated S. meliloti genes on the SymbiosisChip were calculated.  To identify localized motif peaks corresponding to genes with analogous (the direction and level of increase/decrease is similar) transcription patterns, we calculated the distances from all possible pairwise combinations of genes in that peak (a peak reflects a group of genes having the motif at one particular position from TSS). As a control, the same number of genes was randomly chosen from the entire database set, and from these a distance population was constructed. A Mann–Whitney U test was used to determine whether the pairwise distance between the genes in a peak was significantly different from pairwise distances for a randomly chosen population. The test was repeated 1000 times with different random populations. For these data, the P-value represents the percentage of trials that were not significant.  Pathway representation and matrix-based motif discovery using MEME to identify additional conserved motifs  The annotations of S. meliloti 1021 genes were obtained from the EnsemblBacteria database Release 21 (12). Genes were mapped to the reference pathways using a public KEGG automatic annotation server version 1.6a (http://www.genome.jp/tools/kaas/). Each LDSS-P positive peak was subjected to statistical representation analysis against each one of the pathways using the ‘representation’ program. Briefly, the representation factor was defined as the number of overlapping genes divided by the expected number of overlapping genes drawn from an LDSS-P positive peak and all 2650 genes in the promoter data set. The representation factor and the hypergeometric probability was calculated according to a previous report (13). LDSS-P positive peaks with the highest representation factor were subjected to a search with MEME analysis to find extended conserved motifs in the promoter. The ‘nr_prom’ is a program to create the input promoter sequences from a LDSS-P positive peak. MEME Suite software Version 4.9.1 patch1 (compiled from source code; (14)) was used to identify conserved motifs within a set of promoters with options (settings: -dna -maxsize 60 000 -mod zoops -nmotifs 3 -minw 6 -maxw 50 -revcomp).  Bacterial one-hybrid assay  The omega-based bacterial one-hybrid (B1H) assay was carried out as described (15). The plasmids pB1H2w2-zif268 (Plasmid #18045) and pH3U3-zif268 (Plasmid #18046) were obtained from Addgene (Cambridge, MA, USA). An attR1-ChroramphenicolR-ccdB-attR2 cassette (Gateway vector conversion system, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) was introduced in frame between KpnI and XbaI sites of pB1H2w2-zif268 to create a Gateway-compatible derivative, pHiS577. The coding sequence of ctrA (SMc00654) and the flanking two attP sites were amplified from the Gateway ORFeome library (16) with primers HI571 (TCGCGTTAACGCTAGCATGGATCTC) and HI572, and subjected to a Gateway LR reaction. A D51E mutation was introduced to ctrA by site-directed mutagenesis with primers HI939 (GGTTCAGTTCGAGGAGAATGATGTCG) and HI940 (TCCTCGAACTGAACCTGCCGGACAT) using a CloneEZ PCR cloning kit (GenScript, Piscataway, NJ, USA). The resulting plasmid was designated pHiS636. To construct reporter fusions, a 45 bp sequence containing the CtrA binding motif in the upstream region of ctrA-P2 promoter (17) was used as the scaffold. Two oligonucleotides (TACACCCGGGCGGCC TCGATACACCTTGCCAGAGTGAATCAGAATTTGTTAACCATTTGGCGAATTCTTTACACTTT and its complementary sequence; the underline denotes the TTAACCMT motif identified by LDSS-P and the first and last 15 bp are homologous to pH3U3-zif268 for CloneEZ reaction) were synthesized, dissolved at 100 μM in TE buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0) containing 50 mM sodium chloride, and heat denatured at 95°C for 5 min, then gradually cooled down to room temperature. The resulting double-stranded fragment was cloned between NotI and EcoRI sites of pH3U3-zif268 by CloneEZ. Plasmids with a base substitution on and adjacent to the TTAACCMT motif were created in similar way.  To test the interaction between RpoZ-CtrA(D51E) fusion and the CtrA binding motifs, Escherichia coli US0 (hisB− pyrF− rpoZ−; Addgene #18049) was transformed with pHiS577 and pHiS636 or its mutated derivatives. The overnight culture was washed twice with 10 mM magnesium sulfate and spotted on M9 plates supplemented with 0.2% D-glucose, 2.5 μg/ml thiamine hydrochloride, 50 μg/ml ampicillin and 25 μg/ml kanamycin, and incubated at 30°C for 2 days. LB plates containing the same antibiotics were used as control. Digital images of the plates were taken using a ChemiDoc MP (Bio-rad) under epi-white illumination.  ",TRUE,TRUE,

PMC4914127,RESULTS AND DISCUSSION,Results and Discussion,AL591688,1,0,0,,"SEE ARTICLE COMMENT ""We annotated the S. meliloti 1021 genome with the most significant 4606 LDSS-P positive motifs relative to the corresponding TSS locations""","  RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  Improved LDSS analysis identifies sequence motifs in bacteria  Previously, hexamer and octamer sequences were shown to work well for LDSS analysis in eukaryotes (4). We used hexamer searches as a starting point for LDSS-P analysis in prokaryotes. For each hexamer sequence, a distribution profile in relation to distance from the TSS was analyzed at a global scale in S. meliloti. This analysis produced 614 656 (42 [combinations of A, C, G, and T at position 1 and 6] × 144 [the 4 nucleotides and the ambiguity codes representing the mixture of 2 (6 codes) and 3 (4 codes) nucleotides at positions 2–5]) distribution profiles with 2 797 994 possible localized motif peaks. Of all possible hexamer motifs, there were 17 970 (0.64%) localized motif peaks containing motifs with no ambiguity codes. The distribution of localized motif peaks is shown in Figure 1. Localized motif peaks were observed most often at 4 major regions: around −95, −40, −15 and +4 from TSS. The regions near −40 and −15 likely correspond to the conserved −35 and −10 regions recognized by prokaryotic sigma factors. The number of genes within the peak (integration) ranged from 2 to 1735 (126.50 ± 115.12; average ± standard deviation). The FSD (see Materials and Methods) ranged from 0.30 to 23.25 (2.49 ± 0.88; average ± standard deviation). Sequence distribution peaks that showed a higher FSD were more symmetrical and well separated from background (data not shown). Localized motif peaks with ambiguity nucleotide codes were assigned to sub-groups based on the peak locations and FSD in their corresponding ATGC-only motif sequences. For example, a grouping process for the AGRACA (R indicates A or G) peak compares the FSD values of corresponding peaks in AGAACA and AGGACA, and designates a unique group identifier consisting of the ATGC-only motif sequence and the left and right border positions of the peak (e.g. AGGACA_−59_−50). This grouping is particularly useful since introducing ambiguity to a motif increases the combination of nucleotides by an order of magnitude and thus would make it more difficult to find the most representative groups from the large number of peaks with similar nucleotide sequences. This grouping information makes it easier to identify the most significant localized motifs from a large variety of similar motifs with ambiguity.  Figure 1.  Distribution of localized motif peak positions. Values along the vertical axis represent cumulative occurrence of LDSS (×) and LDSS-P (•) positive pentamer and hexamer peaks at each position along the horizontal axis. The criteria to identify localized motif (by LDSS) and co-expressed (LDSS-P) peaks are described in the text. Localized motifs identified by LDSS and LDSS-P positive peaks lay in specific regions: for LDSS, peaks tended to occur at around −95, −40, −15, and +4 from TSS; for LDSS-P, peaks typically occurred at around −40 and −15.  We tested whether the improved LDSS algorithm can identify known −35 and −10 motifs with reasonable sensitivity. RpoE2 is an RNA polymerase ECF sigma factor that is responsible for activating the transcription of general stress response genes in S. meliloti. The target genes of RpoE2 have a consensus sequence of GGAAC-N15/16-gcgTTt (lowercase characters indicate less conservation) in their promoters (18). The LDSS profiles of GGAACA, GGAACC, GGAACG and GGAACT, which partly overlaps the −35 motif of the RpoE2 promoter consensus, is shown in Figure 2. The LDSS-P algorithm detected major peaks between −36 and −32 (consisted from 37 genes, FSD 7.621), −36 and −28 (27 genes, FSD 3.376) and −35 and −32 (20 genes, FSD 5.323) from GGAAA, GGAACC and GGAACT, respectively. No significant localized peak was detected from GGAACG. The total number of unique genes in these 3 peaks was 84. We compared these 84 genes with the significantly induced genes by RpoE2 overexpression identified by transcriptome analysis using microarrays (7). Of the 87 genes that were increased more than 2-fold by RpoE2 overexpression and with at least 1 TSS assigned in our promoter data set, 54 were found in the GGAAC(A/C/T) peaks; this represented 62.1% of the gene sets. The transcriptome results should include both direct and indirect targets of RpoE2-polymerase. Our results showed strong matching with the RpoE2-overexpression data, and indicate that almost 2/3 of the implied target genes are directly controlled by RpoE2. This analysis showed that LDSS can identify conserved functional motifs from a set of unclassified bacterial promoters without an instruction set or prior knowledge of targets.  Figure 2.

The vertical axis indicates the total number of promoters with the motif. The horizontal axis indicates relative position from the transcription start site (position at 0 corresponds to the TSS). Crosses (×) and filled circles (•) indicate raw count and running average, respectively, within a 5 bp window.  Global LDSS-P analysis of S. meliloti  We used a large set of global transcription data for S. meliloti to identify localized motif peaks associated with coordinated transcription. These transcriptomic data were generated using the SymbiosisChip, a custom Affymetrix microarray platform (19), and are all based on comparison between appropriate wild-type and/or empty vector controls and the test construct or condition. These data sets include tests for function of numerous regulatory proteins (Supplementary Table S1).  We created a gene distance matrix by calculating the distance (1 - Pearson's linear correlation coefficient) of normalized signal intensity between all possible pairwise combinations of S. meliloti genes from every test condition. We calculated the distances of all possible pairwise combinations of genes within a peak; treated it as a population; and statistically asked (using a non-parametric Mann–Whitney U test) if a set of genes grouped by LDSS has a significantly closer distance population than that of a randomly chosen group of the same number of sequences (P < 0.05). For each peak, we repeated this test 1000 times with different sets of randomly selected genes to evaluate the robustness of the grouping and calculated a functional P-value, which is the percentage of trials in which the two distance populations showed no significant statistical difference between the LDSS-grouped peak and randomly selected genes. We focused on LDSS peaks with 5 or more genes to obtain a reasonable number of groups. We selected 241 918 peaks (8.65% of all peaks in the previous step) which had an uncorrected functional P-value less than 0.05: these peaks were categorized as LDSS-P positive. The genes corresponding to these LDSS-P positive peaks not only share a hexamer motif at a specific position in promoters but also show similar expression patterns (increase and decrease). Figure 1 shows the distribution of LDSS-P positive motifs that are shared within a group of genes expressed in parallel (note filled circles). We observed two major peaks centered at −39 and −15. Almost all of the peaks upstream of −50 and downstream of −10, including the two peaks near −95 and +4 in the previous step, were rejected after expression pattern-based screening. We implemented a program (‘extract_best_peak_by_distance’) to pick the best LDSS-P positive peaks, namely those with the shortest average distance among each ATGC-only motif group (described above). The process efficiently removed multiple similar ambiguous motifs which might be derived from the same ATGC-only functional element (data not shown). This process selected 4905 most representative peaks from the 103 558 LDSS-P positive peaks, and these peaks are subjected to the pathway representation analysis.  It is a challenging and labor intensive task to narrow down and identify motifs that are shared within a particular group of genes from a large number of LDSS-P positive peaks, even after the grouping process described above. As a test case for the identification of functional hexamer motifs corresponding to a particular groups of genes, we statistically analyzed the correlation between LDSS-P positive peaks and metabolic and signaling pathways. We chose KEGG pathway as the reference because it is one of the most comprehensive, well structured, and generally applicable pathway information data sets (20). We applied a statistical analysis which uses the representation factor (defined as the number of detected overlapping genes divided by the expected number of overlapping genes drawn from two independent peaks, and its hypergeometric probability; (13)) to identify LDSS-P positive motifs which are significantly over-represented in the pathway of interest. The strongest LDSS-P positive peaks (see above) were searched for representation against each of the 148 KEGG pathways, and motifs with hypergeometric probability of less than 0.05 were considered to be significant. Table 1 shows examples of the most significant LDSS-P positive peaks corresponding to KEGG pathways. For each of these, there were four or fewer potential motif sequences (as determined in the previous calculation) so as to avoid too much ambiguity.  Table 1.

AACCAT may represent an extended CtrA binding motif  As shown in Table 1, a TTWAMC (W and M indicate A/T and A/C, respectively) motif was significantly over-represented at between −36 and −27 from TSS among the cell-cycle regulation pathway genes (ccr04112). We chose this pathway as a model because it is well characterized, and the mechanism and genes for cell cycle regulation are highly conserved in α-proteobacteria. The pathway was drawn based on the findings in Caulobacter crescentus. The KAAS program identified 30 orthologous genes in S. meliloti, and these genes include the essential master cell cycle transcriptional regulators dnaA, gcrA and ctrA and an essential cell-cycle regulated DNA methyltransferase ccrM (21). There were 48 genes in this LDSS-P positive peak in our promoter data set (Supplementary Table S2). We used the promoter sequence of these 48 genes and MEME program to identify the conserved nucleotide motifs that spanned outside the identified TTWAMC motif. The sequence logo (22), which visualizes nucleotide conservation at each position by MEME analysis, is shown in Figure 3.  Figure 3.  Conserved nucleotides in TTWAMC group. The sequence conservation for the TTWAMC motif found at between −37 and −25 from TSS in the S. meliloti database. The nucleotide representation logo was generated using MEME as described in Materials and Methods. The height of each nucleotide in the logo represents the conservation of the nucleotide at each position.  The analysis revealed that there were additional highly conserved nucleotides in two places upstream and downstream of the identified TTWAMC motif: an adenine and thymine (AT) were immediately adjacent to the 3′ end of TTWAMC, plus 5 nt upstream we observed a second motif, GTTAACC. The TTAACC part of the GTTAACC motif was marked positive by the proposed LDSS-P criterion (22 genes; an uncorrected functional P-value of 0.004 for TTAACC between −80 and −77). In contrast, the GTTAAC was not captured due to dissimilar expression patterns (0.129 for GTTAAC between −84 and −78). It is most likely that because LDSS-P relies on the localization of relatively short k-mers, some of such sequences are too common among the promoters or genomic sequences due to the organisms GC bias and other nucleotide preferences. In such a case, it would not be possible to distinguish significant localizations from such background noise.  We found the overall conserved motif (GTTAACC-N5-TTWAMCAT) shows overlap with the reported consensus sequence of CtrA binding motif (TTAA-N7-TTAA; (23)). CtrA is an essential transcriptional regulator that coordinates DNA replication, cell division and polar morphogenesis, and is considered the master cell cycle regulator in α-proteobacteria (24). In S. meliloti, phosphorylated CtrA binds to a consensus sequence TAA-N7-TTAAC based on the analysis in the promoter region of ctrA (17). We hypothesized that the AACCAT is a part of an extended CtrA binding motif.  We tested this hypothesis by asking whether a point mutation in the AACCAT motif changes interaction with CtrA, using a bacterial one-hybrid assay as a reporter for protein–DNA binding. A translational fusion with an RNA polymerase ω subunit, RpoZ, and a constitutively active D51E mutant of S. meliloti CtrA was created and used to determine the interaction between CtrA (D51E) and its binding motifs (with the extended AACCAT sequence). We created a set of pH3U3-derivative plasmids, containing wild-type or mutagenized CtrA binding motifs upstream of ura and pyrF genes driven by a weak minimal promoter elements. In this system, histidine and uracil auxotrophy in the host E. coli strain US0 is (25–29) complemented only when the CtrA (D51E) protein fused with RpoZ binds to the motif. This allows binding of an RNA polymerase holoenzyme to the −35/−10 region of the weak promoter, so transcription can initiate. The degree of complementation (ura and pyrF expression) reflects the stability of interaction between the protein and DNA. We confirmed that the D51E mutation results in enhanced binding to the CtrA binding motif (data not shown). The interactions of CtrA (D51E) with wild-type versus 12 different mutagenized CtrA binding motifs, and with zif268 (the binding sequence of a well characterized zinc-finger transcriptional factor, Zif268, as a negative control; (30)) are shown in Figure 4. The T2C (the second thymine in the TTAACCAT motif was substituted to cytosine), A4G, C5T, C6G, A7G and T8C mutations caused significant loss of CtrA binding, whereas T1C, A3G and C6A did not alter the binding. The C6T mutation caused better binding of CtrA, suggesting that the C6 position is an important determinant for CtrA binding affinity. Unexpectedly, one of the mutations at the flanks of the motif, a thymine to cytosine transversion at 3 bp upstream of the motif (Mut1), resulted in better binding, comparable to that of the C6T (Mut7) mutation. These results reveal that the expanded CAT and the upstream regions in addition to the previously identified TTAAC motif influence the binding of CtrA. Here, LDSS-P analysis was effective in identifying novel functional motifs in promoters in S. meliloti, and we propose it can be used similarly for other bacteria.  Figure 4.  Bacterial one-hybrid assay of CtrA (D51E) and mutated CtrA binding motifs. At left, sequences for mutants 1–12 are shown underneath the newly proposed CtrA binding consensus. Degree of binding is summarized to the right of each sequence (from − for no binding to +++ for the strongest binding). At right, growth of cells on M9 minimal medium or LB rich medium due to successful binding of CtrA to the motif for each mutant.  The combination of LDSS-P plus other matrix-based motif finding tools is very powerful because LDSS-P is tolerant to unrelated promoters that may be present in the input promoter set, thanks to its principle that focuses on the occurrence of short k-mers, and can increase the sensitivity to find less conserved motifs in the subsequent analysis.  Annotation of motifs in the S. meliloti genome with LDSS-P  We noted some groups of genes within LDSS-P peaks that empirically showed similarity in their gene expression patterns. Among the short nucleotide motifs that LDSS found at certain defined distances from TSS, there were two groups: (i) motifs determining transcriptional specificity, which are LDSS-P positive peaks near −39 and −15, consistent with previous reports in rhizobia (7,31) and with the canonical model for the σ70 promoter sequence (a hexamer at −35 separated by 15–21 nucleotide from the −10 hexamer in E. coli; (32)); and (ii) sequences corresponding to peaks at −95 and +4 from the TSS. We infer that these peaks at −95 and +4 are not primarily involved in transcriptional control, at least in the conditions covered by our transcriptome data sets, because these groups of genes did not show significant co-expression in the transcriptional data sets, thus rejected by LDSS-P analysis. We asked whether the peak at +4 is due to nucleotide bias from start codons which are located within 6 nucleotides of the TSS, however, we found only 12 of such genes in our promoter data set. Therefore, it is unlikely that these peaks are the bias from start codons located near TSS. Another possible explanation for the +4 peak would be a result of nucleotide preference in transcriptional initiation by RNA polymerase. In considering the peak at −90, we note the report that in E. coli, a flexibly tethered alpha subunit C-terminal domain, which recognizes the upstream sequence of the −35 element, can bind non-specifically to more distant DNA sequences, making contacts up to −90 from TSS (33). It is also possible that −95 and +4 peaks influence binding of other regulators, and/or affect other levels of gene expression control.  Recent advances in genome sequencing technology have enabled rapid acquisition of bacterial whole genome sequences. Since orthologous DNA binding proteins and their target nucleotide sequences are expected to be well conserved between phylogenetically related organisms, we propose that LDSS-P positive peaks in a model organism are likely to be functional in other related species. Indeed, these short motifs may be better conserved than the TSS themselves, due to the selective pressure from motif functionality in protein binding. Therefore, the transcriptional regulatory networks identified in a model organism can be efficiently transferred into non-model species by converting raw TSS locations into LDSS-P positive motifs.  We annotated the S. meliloti 1021 genome with the most significant 4606 LDSS-P positive motifs relative to the corresponding TSS locations. This produced more than 88 000 annotations for the promoter regions of previously annotated coding sequences: each annotation indicates the corresponding LDSS-positive motif; relative distance from TSS; the representing ATGC-only motif peak; and statistical evaluations.

PMC4914127,Abstract,Abstract,AL591985,1,0,0,,Organism referring to data?,"  Abstract  Identifying functional elements in promoter sequences is a major goal in computational and experimental genome biology. Here, we describe an algorithm, Local Distribution of Short Sequences for Prokaryotes (LDSS-P), to identify conserved short motifs located at specific positions in the promoters of co-expressed prokaryotic genes. As a test case, we applied this algorithm to a symbiotic nitrogen-fixing bacterium, Sinorhizobium meliloti. The LDSS-P profiles that overlap with the 5′ section of the extracytoplasmic function RNA polymerase sigma factor RpoE2 consensus sequences displayed a sharp peak between -34 and -32 from TSS positions. The corresponding genes overlap significantly with RpoE2 targets identified from previous experiments. We further identified several groups of genes that are co-regulated with characterized marker genes. Our data indicate that in S. meliloti, and possibly in other Rhizobiaceae species, the master cell cycle regulator CtrA may recognize an expanded motif (AACCAT), which is positionally shifted from the previously reported CtrA consensus sequence in Caulobacter crescentus. Bacterial one-hybrid experiments showed that base substitution in the expanded motif either increase or decrease the binding by CtrA. These results show the effectiveness of LDSS-P as a method to delineate functional promoter elements.  ",FALSE,FALSE,

Organism referring to data?","  INTRODUCTION  Understanding promoter structures and deducing corresponding regulatory networks are major goals in genome biology. Prokaryotic promoters are relatively short (∼50 bp) sequences that provide a recognition site for RNA polymerase in association with a specific sigma factor (1), and thus define the site for transcription initiation. Most bacteria have multiple sigma factors that recognize distinct promoter sequences. A change in sigma factor results in a global change in transcription profile, and this mechanism is used by numerous bacteria as they adapt to changing environments. In addition, promoters are often adjacent to other DNA sequences that serve to bind transcription activators or repressors. These trans-acting proteins add another layer of regulation and may govern further networks of co-expressed genes.  Motif finding is an important step and major challenge to understand and predict promoter functions and regulations. Several approaches are used to predict functional motifs that are recognized by RNA polymerase sigma factors and other DNA binding proteins. Numerous algorithms have been developed during the last two decades. Das and Dai (2) comprehensively reviewed some representative algorithms and categorized into two major categories: (i) probabilistic sequence models where the model parameters are estimated using maximum-likelihood principle or Bayesian inference and (ii) word-based (string-based) approaches that often rely on counting and comparing oligonucleotide frequencies. These algorithms often require pre-grouping or ‘enrichment’ of genes as input. To assemble the set of input sequences, one may use DNA microarray- and RNA sequencing-based transcriptome profiling to reveal genes showing parallel expression, or use chromatin immunoprecipitation and systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) to define DNA sequences with affinity for specific proteins. Such sets of experimentally derived sequences are then analyzed with a probabilistic algorithm.  In some cases, however, there may be little or no pre-existing evidence to characterize all genes, or all expression conditions, especially for non-model systems. In such cases, a consensus-independent method (one that does not require prior knowledge about the targets) may be useful for predicting regulatory networks. Local distribution of short sequences (LDSS) (3) is a de novo motif-finding algorithm based on the presumed presence of conserved short (6–8 mer) sequences in cis to transcription start sites. This algorithm assumes that a functional short sequence, such as an RNA polymerase sigma factor binding site, must be located at a certain defined position in the promoter for its functionality. In the case of eukaryotic promoters, examples are the TATA box and binding sites for NRF-1, SP1, CREB, ATF and E2F (3,4). The original LDSS algorithm has proved to be a simple and powerful method for extracting possible functional short motifs without any knowledge about the genes in a promoter data set, and has been used to analyze and characterize a large number of promoters from plants and animals. A similar algorithm has been included in PEAKS positional footprinting server (5). It supports the analysis of significant motif positional biases up to 6-mer sequences, however, it does not support longer oligomers or combination of 2 or more nucleotides at a position. Also, the PEAKS program is not capable of analyzing large-scale data sets: it is a web-based tool, and it is cumbersome to integrate a systematic data mining process based on the identified candidates using this web program. The original LDSS algorithm has not been tested on prokaryotic promoters. Also, it does not provide a general way to evaluate computationally which genes among the large initial number of mathematically equivalent localized motif peaks are likely co-regulated in a real living system. We have developed an improved algorithm, named LDSS-P, that identifies conserved short motifs that are shared in the promoters of unselected gene sets and in large transcriptome data sets, and is able to evaluate whether these groups of genes are actually co-regulated in the organism. That is, the new algorithm captures both motif-position similarity, and co-expression probability, in a single numerical outcome. This allows one computational approach rather than first identifying all the sets of co-regulated genes, with a subsequent and separate search for shared motifs. A combined spatial and co-expression calculation presents significant challenges for computation time. We made changes to the original LDSS algorithm so we can test all possible 2 to 4 nucleotide combinations that are represented by IUPAC ambiguity codes (6) at each location, thus streamlining the initial comparison processes. Also, LDSS-P employs threading and discretization (modification of variable granularity) to allow parallel computation; this allows efficient calculation using multi-core CPUs and large distributed computing resources such as PC clusters and cloud computing. The LDSS-P program employs a Map-Reduce strategy and the ‘prefix’ parameter function to calculate each unique specified nucleotide space.  In the present paper, we validated the effectiveness of the LDSS (position information) and LDSS-P (position and co-expression) algorithms in bacteria using the plant symbiotic nitrogen-fixing bacterium Sinorhizobium meliloti as the model. We identified several groups of genes that share a short motif at a particular position with respect to mapped 5′ transcription start sites, and that are co-regulated in large scale transcriptome data sets. Our informatics analysis and follow-up experimental data indicate that the cell cycle regulator CtrA may recognize an expanded motif shifted from its previously reported consensus.  ",FALSE,TRUE,

The 5′ TSS-enriched library was created from RNA samples representing 16 different growth and stress conditions (Supplementary Table S1); this set did not include samples from nitrogen-fixing nodules. It is anticipated that because many genes are co-transcribed in operons, the number of TSS will be substantially lower than the number of annotated genes (9). A matrix that contains the count of mapped TSS reads at each position was created for each of the 3 replicons. Locations with fewer than 25 mapped TSS sites were removed from the matrix. Using the refined matrices, we employed Savitsky–Golay's smoothing differentiation with 8-point convolution (10) to identify significant TSS peaks by removing random spikes. Although some S. meliloti genes have long 5′ untranslated regions, a TSS peak was assigned to a gene only when an identified peak located within 150 bp from the 5′ end nucleotide of a coding sequence (CDS) to be sure a TSS is not mistakenly assigned to an unrelated CDS. In the event two or more TSS peaks were found within the 150 bp, all TSS peaks were included for later analyses, except for those with a read count lower than 20% and/or those located within a 50 bp radius of the highest peak. In the present study, we focused on the most accurate TSSs; these were assigned to 2217 out of 6235 annotated CDS. The non-redundant promoter and 5′-UTR data set (‘promoter data set’ hereafter) was then created by extracting the 100 bp upstream and 50 bp downstream sequences from each TSS.  LDSS-P analysis  The LDSS-P approach includes two components: LDSS (position) and co-expression analyses. All the programs described here are available through our website (http://cmgm.stanford.edu/biology/long/files/ichida2016/LDSS-P_dist.zip).  LDSS calculation  LDSS analysis was carried out with a combination of C++ programs incorporating the algorithm described in the previous paper (3). All programs were compiled using Intel C++ compiler version 11.1.059 (Intel, Santa Clara, CA, USA) and were run on a Linux PC cluster (Fujitsu Primergy RX200 S5, Intel Xeon X5570 2.93 GHz processors, 12 GB memory, CentOS 5.4, 48 nodes, 384 cores in total). All possible hexamer sequences were searched for possible placement in each sequence position in the promoter data set (described above). In addition to the standard four nucleotides, combinations of all 2 and 3 nucleotide possibilities were included for positions 2–5 within the hexamer. The possible number of ambiguous nucleotides for any one site is not limited in the present analysis, thus exact matches and corresponding ambiguous hexamers are all counted. For example, we established a set of all occurrences of the hexamer ATGCAT. We also formed a set of all sequences AWGCAT and AHGCAT, where W can be either T or A, and H can be T, A, or C (or ‘not-G’), and so on (6) for all 2 and 3 nucleotide combinations in positions 2–5. In order to assure the effective motif length and specificity at the border, ambiguity codes were not permitted at position 1 and 6. This allowed incorporation of ambiguity in the first pass of the search. The occurrence of the hexamer sequences was counted for each nucleotide position relative to the TSS. A running moving average was computed with a bin of 5 bp, and used to identify localized motif peaks, which would indicate a sequence position where a motif is significantly localized. The average count (height) divided by standard deviation of counts at all possible genome positions within the start-site database was designated as ‘fold standard deviation’ (FSD). The left and right borders of a peak were adjusted to maximize FSD within the range of 5 bp upstream and downstream from that sequence position. All localized motif peaks were loaded into a data set that included for each entry: the sequence; left- and right-border positions; peak height; and average height within and outside of the peak. For motifs found by incorporating ambiguity, the best corresponding ATGC-only peak (that with the highest FSD) was annotated as the representative ATGC-only motif.  Co-expression analysis  A gene expression vector was created from 261 SymbiosisChip transcriptome results from 24 projects (described in Results and Supplementary Table S1). Hybridization signals were normalized for each project using the RMA method (11). The normalized values were combined for each gene to create global expression vectors. Distance between two genes X and Y was defined as (1 - Pearson's linear correlation coefficient), and is expressed by following equation:  \documentclass[12pt]{minimal}  \usepackage{amsmath}  \usepackage{wasysym}   \usepackage{amsfonts}   \usepackage{amssymb}   \usepackage{amsbsy}  \usepackage{upgreek}  \usepackage{mathrsfs}  \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}  \begin{document}  }{}\begin{equation*}D(x,y) = 1 - \frac{1}{{n - 1}}\mathop \sum \limits_{i = 1}^n \left( {\frac{{{X_{\rm i}} - \bar X}}{{{S_{X}}}}} \right)\left( {\frac{{{Y_{\rm i}} - \bar Y}}{{{S_{Y}}}}} \right)\end{equation*}\end{document}  Where sX and sY denotes standard deviation of all hybridization signals from gene X and Y, respectively. Distances between pairwise combinations of all 6091 annotated S. meliloti genes on the SymbiosisChip were calculated.  To identify localized motif peaks corresponding to genes with analogous (the direction and level of increase/decrease is similar) transcription patterns, we calculated the distances from all possible pairwise combinations of genes in that peak (a peak reflects a group of genes having the motif at one particular position from TSS). As a control, the same number of genes was randomly chosen from the entire database set, and from these a distance population was constructed. A Mann–Whitney U test was used to determine whether the pairwise distance between the genes in a peak was significantly different from pairwise distances for a randomly chosen population. The test was repeated 1000 times with different random populations. For these data, the P-value represents the percentage of trials that were not significant.  Pathway representation and matrix-based motif discovery using MEME to identify additional conserved motifs  The annotations of S. meliloti 1021 genes were obtained from the EnsemblBacteria database Release 21 (12). Genes were mapped to the reference pathways using a public KEGG automatic annotation server version 1.6a (http://www.genome.jp/tools/kaas/). Each LDSS-P positive peak was subjected to statistical representation analysis against each one of the pathways using the ‘representation’ program. Briefly, the representation factor was defined as the number of overlapping genes divided by the expected number of overlapping genes drawn from an LDSS-P positive peak and all 2650 genes in the promoter data set. The representation factor and the hypergeometric probability was calculated according to a previous report (13). LDSS-P positive peaks with the highest representation factor were subjected to a search with MEME analysis to find extended conserved motifs in the promoter. The ‘nr_prom’ is a program to create the input promoter sequences from a LDSS-P positive peak. MEME Suite software Version 4.9.1 patch1 (compiled from source code; (14)) was used to identify conserved motifs within a set of promoters with options (settings: -dna -maxsize 60 000 -mod zoops -nmotifs 3 -minw 6 -maxw 50 -revcomp).  Bacterial one-hybrid assay  The omega-based bacterial one-hybrid (B1H) assay was carried out as described (15). The plasmids pB1H2w2-zif268 (Plasmid #18045) and pH3U3-zif268 (Plasmid #18046) were obtained from Addgene (Cambridge, MA, USA). An attR1-ChroramphenicolR-ccdB-attR2 cassette (Gateway vector conversion system, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) was introduced in frame between KpnI and XbaI sites of pB1H2w2-zif268 to create a Gateway-compatible derivative, pHiS577. The coding sequence of ctrA (SMc00654) and the flanking two attP sites were amplified from the Gateway ORFeome library (16) with primers HI571 (TCGCGTTAACGCTAGCATGGATCTC) and HI572, and subjected to a Gateway LR reaction. A D51E mutation was introduced to ctrA by site-directed mutagenesis with primers HI939 (GGTTCAGTTCGAGGAGAATGATGTCG) and HI940 (TCCTCGAACTGAACCTGCCGGACAT) using a CloneEZ PCR cloning kit (GenScript, Piscataway, NJ, USA). The resulting plasmid was designated pHiS636. To construct reporter fusions, a 45 bp sequence containing the CtrA binding motif in the upstream region of ctrA-P2 promoter (17) was used as the scaffold. Two oligonucleotides (TACACCCGGGCGGCC TCGATACACCTTGCCAGAGTGAATCAGAATTTGTTAACCATTTGGCGAATTCTTTACACTTT and its complementary sequence; the underline denotes the TTAACCMT motif identified by LDSS-P and the first and last 15 bp are homologous to pH3U3-zif268 for CloneEZ reaction) were synthesized, dissolved at 100 μM in TE buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0) containing 50 mM sodium chloride, and heat denatured at 95°C for 5 min, then gradually cooled down to room temperature. The resulting double-stranded fragment was cloned between NotI and EcoRI sites of pH3U3-zif268 by CloneEZ. Plasmids with a base substitution on and adjacent to the TTAACCMT motif were created in similar way.  To test the interaction between RpoZ-CtrA(D51E) fusion and the CtrA binding motifs, Escherichia coli US0 (hisB− pyrF− rpoZ−; Addgene #18049) was transformed with pHiS577 and pHiS636 or its mutated derivatives. The overnight culture was washed twice with 10 mM magnesium sulfate and spotted on M9 plates supplemented with 0.2% D-glucose, 2.5 μg/ml thiamine hydrochloride, 50 μg/ml ampicillin and 25 μg/ml kanamycin, and incubated at 30°C for 2 days. LB plates containing the same antibiotics were used as control. Digital images of the plates were taken using a ChemiDoc MP (Bio-rad) under epi-white illumination.  ",TRUE,TRUE,

PMC4914127,RESULTS AND DISCUSSION,Results and Discussion,AL591985,1,0,0,,"SEE ARTICLE COMMENT ""We annotated the S. meliloti 1021 genome with the most significant 4606 LDSS-P positive motifs relative to the corresponding TSS locations""","  RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  Improved LDSS analysis identifies sequence motifs in bacteria  Previously, hexamer and octamer sequences were shown to work well for LDSS analysis in eukaryotes (4). We used hexamer searches as a starting point for LDSS-P analysis in prokaryotes. For each hexamer sequence, a distribution profile in relation to distance from the TSS was analyzed at a global scale in S. meliloti. This analysis produced 614 656 (42 [combinations of A, C, G, and T at position 1 and 6] × 144 [the 4 nucleotides and the ambiguity codes representing the mixture of 2 (6 codes) and 3 (4 codes) nucleotides at positions 2–5]) distribution profiles with 2 797 994 possible localized motif peaks. Of all possible hexamer motifs, there were 17 970 (0.64%) localized motif peaks containing motifs with no ambiguity codes. The distribution of localized motif peaks is shown in Figure 1. Localized motif peaks were observed most often at 4 major regions: around −95, −40, −15 and +4 from TSS. The regions near −40 and −15 likely correspond to the conserved −35 and −10 regions recognized by prokaryotic sigma factors. The number of genes within the peak (integration) ranged from 2 to 1735 (126.50 ± 115.12; average ± standard deviation). The FSD (see Materials and Methods) ranged from 0.30 to 23.25 (2.49 ± 0.88; average ± standard deviation). Sequence distribution peaks that showed a higher FSD were more symmetrical and well separated from background (data not shown). Localized motif peaks with ambiguity nucleotide codes were assigned to sub-groups based on the peak locations and FSD in their corresponding ATGC-only motif sequences. For example, a grouping process for the AGRACA (R indicates A or G) peak compares the FSD values of corresponding peaks in AGAACA and AGGACA, and designates a unique group identifier consisting of the ATGC-only motif sequence and the left and right border positions of the peak (e.g. AGGACA_−59_−50). This grouping is particularly useful since introducing ambiguity to a motif increases the combination of nucleotides by an order of magnitude and thus would make it more difficult to find the most representative groups from the large number of peaks with similar nucleotide sequences. This grouping information makes it easier to identify the most significant localized motifs from a large variety of similar motifs with ambiguity.  Figure 1.  Distribution of localized motif peak positions. Values along the vertical axis represent cumulative occurrence of LDSS (×) and LDSS-P (•) positive pentamer and hexamer peaks at each position along the horizontal axis. The criteria to identify localized motif (by LDSS) and co-expressed (LDSS-P) peaks are described in the text. Localized motifs identified by LDSS and LDSS-P positive peaks lay in specific regions: for LDSS, peaks tended to occur at around −95, −40, −15, and +4 from TSS; for LDSS-P, peaks typically occurred at around −40 and −15.  We tested whether the improved LDSS algorithm can identify known −35 and −10 motifs with reasonable sensitivity. RpoE2 is an RNA polymerase ECF sigma factor that is responsible for activating the transcription of general stress response genes in S. meliloti. The target genes of RpoE2 have a consensus sequence of GGAAC-N15/16-gcgTTt (lowercase characters indicate less conservation) in their promoters (18). The LDSS profiles of GGAACA, GGAACC, GGAACG and GGAACT, which partly overlaps the −35 motif of the RpoE2 promoter consensus, is shown in Figure 2. The LDSS-P algorithm detected major peaks between −36 and −32 (consisted from 37 genes, FSD 7.621), −36 and −28 (27 genes, FSD 3.376) and −35 and −32 (20 genes, FSD 5.323) from GGAAA, GGAACC and GGAACT, respectively. No significant localized peak was detected from GGAACG. The total number of unique genes in these 3 peaks was 84. We compared these 84 genes with the significantly induced genes by RpoE2 overexpression identified by transcriptome analysis using microarrays (7). Of the 87 genes that were increased more than 2-fold by RpoE2 overexpression and with at least 1 TSS assigned in our promoter data set, 54 were found in the GGAAC(A/C/T) peaks; this represented 62.1% of the gene sets. The transcriptome results should include both direct and indirect targets of RpoE2-polymerase. Our results showed strong matching with the RpoE2-overexpression data, and indicate that almost 2/3 of the implied target genes are directly controlled by RpoE2. This analysis showed that LDSS can identify conserved functional motifs from a set of unclassified bacterial promoters without an instruction set or prior knowledge of targets.  Figure 2.  Distribution profiles of GGAACN, RpoE2 target consensus motifs. Examples of hexamer analysis for GGAACN, which partly overlaps with the RpoE2 consensus motif. The vertical axis indicates the total number of promoters with the motif. The horizontal axis indicates relative position from the transcription start site (position at 0 corresponds to the TSS). Crosses (×) and filled circles (•) indicate raw count and running average, respectively, within a 5 bp window.  Global LDSS-P analysis of S. meliloti  We used a large set of global transcription data for S. meliloti to identify localized motif peaks associated with coordinated transcription. These transcriptomic data were generated using the SymbiosisChip, a custom Affymetrix microarray platform (19), and are all based on comparison between appropriate wild-type and/or empty vector controls and the test construct or condition. These data sets include tests for function of numerous regulatory proteins (Supplementary Table S1).  We created a gene distance matrix by calculating the distance (1 - Pearson's linear correlation coefficient) of normalized signal intensity between all possible pairwise combinations of S. meliloti genes from every test condition. We calculated the distances of all possible pairwise combinations of genes within a peak; treated it as a population; and statistically asked (using a non-parametric Mann–Whitney U test) if a set of genes grouped by LDSS has a significantly closer distance population than that of a randomly chosen group of the same number of sequences (P < 0.05). For each peak, we repeated this test 1000 times with different sets of randomly selected genes to evaluate the robustness of the grouping and calculated a functional P-value, which is the percentage of trials in which the two distance populations showed no significant statistical difference between the LDSS-grouped peak and randomly selected genes. We focused on LDSS peaks with 5 or more genes to obtain a reasonable number of groups. We selected 241 918 peaks (8.65% of all peaks in the previous step) which had an uncorrected functional P-value less than 0.05: these peaks were categorized as LDSS-P positive. The genes corresponding to these LDSS-P positive peaks not only share a hexamer motif at a specific position in promoters but also show similar expression patterns (increase and decrease). Figure 1 shows the distribution of LDSS-P positive motifs that are shared within a group of genes expressed in parallel (note filled circles). We observed two major peaks centered at −39 and −15. Almost all of the peaks upstream of −50 and downstream of −10, including the two peaks near −95 and +4 in the previous step, were rejected after expression pattern-based screening. We implemented a program (‘extract_best_peak_by_distance’) to pick the best LDSS-P positive peaks, namely those with the shortest average distance among each ATGC-only motif group (described above). The process efficiently removed multiple similar ambiguous motifs which might be derived from the same ATGC-only functional element (data not shown). This process selected 4905 most representative peaks from the 103 558 LDSS-P positive peaks, and these peaks are subjected to the pathway representation analysis.  It is a challenging and labor intensive task to narrow down and identify motifs that are shared within a particular group of genes from a large number of LDSS-P positive peaks, even after the grouping process described above. As a test case for the identification of functional hexamer motifs corresponding to a particular groups of genes, we statistically analyzed the correlation between LDSS-P positive peaks and metabolic and signaling pathways. We chose KEGG pathway as the reference because it is one of the most comprehensive, well structured, and generally applicable pathway information data sets (20). We applied a statistical analysis which uses the representation factor (defined as the number of detected overlapping genes divided by the expected number of overlapping genes drawn from two independent peaks, and its hypergeometric probability; (13)) to identify LDSS-P positive motifs which are significantly over-represented in the pathway of interest. The strongest LDSS-P positive peaks (see above) were searched for representation against each of the 148 KEGG pathways, and motifs with hypergeometric probability of less than 0.05 were considered to be significant.

AACCAT may represent an extended CtrA binding motif  As shown in Table 1, a TTWAMC (W and M indicate A/T and A/C, respectively) motif was significantly over-represented at between −36 and −27 from TSS among the cell-cycle regulation pathway genes (ccr04112). We chose this pathway as a model because it is well characterized, and the mechanism and genes for cell cycle regulation are highly conserved in α-proteobacteria. The pathway was drawn based on the findings in Caulobacter crescentus. The KAAS program identified 30 orthologous genes in S. meliloti, and these genes include the essential master cell cycle transcriptional regulators dnaA, gcrA and ctrA and an essential cell-cycle regulated DNA methyltransferase ccrM (21). There were 48 genes in this LDSS-P positive peak in our promoter data set (Supplementary Table S2). We used the promoter sequence of these 48 genes and MEME program to identify the conserved nucleotide motifs that spanned outside the identified TTWAMC motif. The sequence logo (22), which visualizes nucleotide conservation at each position by MEME analysis, is shown in Figure 3.  Figure 3.  Conserved nucleotides in TTWAMC group. The sequence conservation for the TTWAMC motif found at between −37 and −25 from TSS in the S. meliloti database. The nucleotide representation logo was generated using MEME as described in Materials and Methods. The height of each nucleotide in the logo represents the conservation of the nucleotide at each position.  The analysis revealed that there were additional highly conserved nucleotides in two places upstream and downstream of the identified TTWAMC motif: an adenine and thymine (AT) were immediately adjacent to the 3′ end of TTWAMC, plus 5 nt upstream we observed a second motif, GTTAACC. The TTAACC part of the GTTAACC motif was marked positive by the proposed LDSS-P criterion (22 genes; an uncorrected functional P-value of 0.004 for TTAACC between −80 and −77). In contrast, the GTTAAC was not captured due to dissimilar expression patterns (0.129 for GTTAAC between −84 and −78). It is most likely that because LDSS-P relies on the localization of relatively short k-mers, some of such sequences are too common among the promoters or genomic sequences due to the organisms GC bias and other nucleotide preferences. In such a case, it would not be possible to distinguish significant localizations from such background noise.  We found the overall conserved motif (GTTAACC-N5-TTWAMCAT) shows overlap with the reported consensus sequence of CtrA binding motif (TTAA-N7-TTAA; (23)). CtrA is an essential transcriptional regulator that coordinates DNA replication, cell division and polar morphogenesis, and is considered the master cell cycle regulator in α-proteobacteria (24). In S. meliloti, phosphorylated CtrA binds to a consensus sequence TAA-N7-TTAAC based on the analysis in the promoter region of ctrA (17). We hypothesized that the AACCAT is a part of an extended CtrA binding motif.  We tested this hypothesis by asking whether a point mutation in the AACCAT motif changes interaction with CtrA, using a bacterial one-hybrid assay as a reporter for protein–DNA binding. A translational fusion with an RNA polymerase ω subunit, RpoZ, and a constitutively active D51E mutant of S. meliloti CtrA was created and used to determine the interaction between CtrA (D51E) and its binding motifs (with the extended AACCAT sequence). We created a set of pH3U3-derivative plasmids, containing wild-type or mutagenized CtrA binding motifs upstream of ura and pyrF genes driven by a weak minimal promoter elements. In this system, histidine and uracil auxotrophy in the host E. coli strain US0 is (25–29) complemented only when the CtrA (D51E) protein fused with RpoZ binds to the motif. This allows binding of an RNA polymerase holoenzyme to the −35/−10 region of the weak promoter, so transcription can initiate. The degree of complementation (ura and pyrF expression) reflects the stability of interaction between the protein and DNA. We confirmed that the D51E mutation results in enhanced binding to the CtrA binding motif (data not shown). The interactions of CtrA (D51E) with wild-type versus 12 different mutagenized CtrA binding motifs, and with zif268 (the binding sequence of a well characterized zinc-finger transcriptional factor, Zif268, as a negative control; (30)) are shown in Figure 4. The T2C (the second thymine in the TTAACCAT motif was substituted to cytosine), A4G, C5T, C6G, A7G and T8C mutations caused significant loss of CtrA binding, whereas T1C, A3G and C6A did not alter the binding. The C6T mutation caused better binding of CtrA, suggesting that the C6 position is an important determinant for CtrA binding affinity. Unexpectedly, one of the mutations at the flanks of the motif, a thymine to cytosine transversion at 3 bp upstream of the motif (Mut1), resulted in better binding, comparable to that of the C6T (Mut7) mutation. These results reveal that the expanded CAT and the upstream regions in addition to the previously identified TTAAC motif influence the binding of CtrA. Here, LDSS-P analysis was effective in identifying novel functional motifs in promoters in S. meliloti, and we propose it can be used similarly for other bacteria.  Figure 4.  Bacterial one-hybrid assay of CtrA (D51E) and mutated CtrA binding motifs. At left, sequences for mutants 1–12 are shown underneath the newly proposed CtrA binding consensus. Degree of binding is summarized to the right of each sequence (from − for no binding to +++ for the strongest binding). At right, growth of cells on M9 minimal medium or LB rich medium due to successful binding of CtrA to the motif for each mutant.  The combination of LDSS-P plus other matrix-based motif finding tools is very powerful because LDSS-P is tolerant to unrelated promoters that may be present in the input promoter set, thanks to its principle that focuses on the occurrence of short k-mers, and can increase the sensitivity to find less conserved motifs in the subsequent analysis.  Annotation of motifs in the S. meliloti genome with LDSS-P  We noted some groups of genes within LDSS-P peaks that empirically showed similarity in their gene expression patterns. Among the short nucleotide motifs that LDSS found at certain defined distances from TSS, there were two groups: (i) motifs determining transcriptional specificity, which are LDSS-P positive peaks near −39 and −15, consistent with previous reports in rhizobia (7,31) and with the canonical model for the σ70 promoter sequence (a hexamer at −35 separated by 15–21 nucleotide from the −10 hexamer in E. coli; (32)); and (ii) sequences corresponding to peaks at −95 and +4 from the TSS. We infer that these peaks at −95 and +4 are not primarily involved in transcriptional control, at least in the conditions covered by our transcriptome data sets, because these groups of genes did not show significant co-expression in the transcriptional data sets, thus rejected by LDSS-P analysis. We asked whether the peak at +4 is due to nucleotide bias from start codons which are located within 6 nucleotides of the TSS, however, we found only 12 of such genes in our promoter data set. Therefore, it is unlikely that these peaks are the bias from start codons located near TSS. Another possible explanation for the +4 peak would be a result of nucleotide preference in transcriptional initiation by RNA polymerase. In considering the peak at −90, we note the report that in E. coli, a flexibly tethered alpha subunit C-terminal domain, which recognizes the upstream sequence of the −35 element, can bind non-specifically to more distant DNA sequences, making contacts up to −90 from TSS (33). It is also possible that −95 and +4 peaks influence binding of other regulators, and/or affect other levels of gene expression control.  Recent advances in genome sequencing technology have enabled rapid acquisition of bacterial whole genome sequences. Since orthologous DNA binding proteins and their target nucleotide sequences are expected to be well conserved between phylogenetically related organisms, we propose that LDSS-P positive peaks in a model organism are likely to be functional in other related species. Indeed, these short motifs may be better conserved than the TSS themselves, due to the selective pressure from motif functionality in protein binding. Therefore, the transcriptional regulatory networks identified in a model organism can be efficiently transferred into non-model species by converting raw TSS locations into LDSS-P positive motifs.  We annotated the S. meliloti 1021 genome with the most significant 4606 LDSS-P positive motifs relative to the corresponding TSS locations. This produced more than 88 000 annotations for the promoter regions of previously annotated coding sequences: each annotation indicates the corresponding LDSS-positive motif; relative distance from TSS; the representing ATGC-only motif peak; and statistical evaluations.

PMC5105107,GENOME ANNOUNCEMENT,Other,MINA00000000,0,0,1,,,"  GENOME ANNOUNCEMENT  Mycobacterium bovis is the causal agent of bovine tuberculosis (BT), a chronic infectious disease, affecting domestic animal species like cattle, wild animals, and sometimes human beings (1–4). France is an officially BT-free EU member, although every year several outbreaks occur in a few regions of the country (5).  The description of the population of M. bovis circulating in France for the last 35 years highlighted that strains of spoligotype SB0120 (or BCG-like), comprising up to 53 different MIRU-VNTR genotypes (4, 6), are the most common. These genotypes of strains are widespread all over the country but, in the last 10 years, a few specific MLVA-profiles seem to spread in particular regions (7). In Dordogne (southwest of France), the main M. bovis strain isolated from infected animals is SB0120−MLVA 5 3 5 3 9 4 5 6. This strain is present in wildlife-livestock multi-host systems, including wild boar, badgers, roe deer, and cattle (7, 8).  We performed whole-genome sequencing of M. bovis in order to improve the knowledge of the genetic determinants involved in modulation of virulence, spread in multi-host systems and persistence over time. The strain SB0120−MLVA 5 3 5 3 9 4 5 6 was isolated in Dordogne in 2010 from mandibular lymph nodes of a wild boar as described before (7).  The isolate was grown in 10 mL of Middlebrook 7H9 liquid media (Becton-Dickinson, France) supplemented with 10% OADC (oleic albumin dextrose catalase) for 4 weeks. Bacteria were thermalized for 1 h at 80°C and chromosomal DNA was extracted by phenol-chloroform method.  DNA sequencing was performed at Genoscreen (Lille, France) on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA), to get 2 × 100 paired-ends sequences for an average coverage of 80×. Sequencing produced 1,929,897 paired-ends reads of 100 bp and 1,844,142 reads after filtering with sickle version 1.33 (9). We performed an alignment between filtered reads and the M. bovis AF2122/97 strain as reference using bowtie2 version 2.2.6 (10). The alignment gave us 3,670,788 reads mapped on the reference corresponding to 97.28% coverage. We then performed de novo assembly using Spades version 3.9.0 (2) on trimmed sequences with a k-mer size of 55. We obtained 135 contigs (the largest one being 205,553 bp) for a total length of 4,295,676 bp (using only contigs larger than 500 bp), a G+C content of 65.55%, and an N50 of 72,210 bp (QUAST version 4.2 [11]). Annotation was performed by the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Prokaryotic Genome Annotation Pipeline (12) which predicted 3,842 coding DNA sequences (CDS) for 4,073 total genes, 45 tRNAs, and 180 pseudo-genes.

These genotypes of strains are widespread all over the country but, in the last 10 years, a few specific MLVA-profiles seem to spread in particular regions (7). In Dordogne (southwest of France), the main M. bovis strain isolated from infected animals is SB0120−MLVA 5 3 5 3 9 4 5 6. This strain is present in wildlife-livestock multi-host systems, including wild boar, badgers, roe deer, and cattle (7, 8).  We performed whole-genome sequencing of M. bovis in order to improve the knowledge of the genetic determinants involved in modulation of virulence, spread in multi-host systems and persistence over time. The strain SB0120−MLVA 5 3 5 3 9 4 5 6 was isolated in Dordogne in 2010 from mandibular lymph nodes of a wild boar as described before (7).  The isolate was grown in 10 mL of Middlebrook 7H9 liquid media (Becton-Dickinson, France) supplemented with 10% OADC (oleic albumin dextrose catalase) for 4 weeks. Bacteria were thermalized for 1 h at 80°C and chromosomal DNA was extracted by phenol-chloroform method.  DNA sequencing was performed at Genoscreen (Lille, France) on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA), to get 2 × 100 paired-ends sequences for an average coverage of 80×. Sequencing produced 1,929,897 paired-ends reads of 100 bp and 1,844,142 reads after filtering with sickle version 1.33 (9). We performed an alignment between filtered reads and the M. bovis AF2122/97 strain as reference using bowtie2 version 2.2.6 (10). The alignment gave us 3,670,788 reads mapped on the reference corresponding to 97.28% coverage. We then performed de novo assembly using Spades version 3.9.0 (2) on trimmed sequences with a k-mer size of 55. We obtained 135 contigs (the largest one being 205,553 bp) for a total length of 4,295,676 bp (using only contigs larger than 500 bp), a G+C content of 65.55%, and an N50 of 72,210 bp (QUAST version 4.2 [11]). Annotation was performed by the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Prokaryotic Genome Annotation Pipeline (12) which predicted 3,842 coding DNA sequences (CDS) for 4,073 total genes, 45 tRNAs, and 180 pseudo-genes.

PMC5210664,Abstract,Abstract,Gs0095506,0,0,0,,,"  The Genomes Online Database (GOLD) (https://gold.jgi.doe.gov) is a manually curated data management system that catalogs sequencing projects with associated metadata from around the world. In the current version of GOLD (v.6), all projects are organized based on a four level classification system in the form of a Study, Organism (for isolates) or Biosample (for environmental samples), Sequencing Project and Analysis Project. Currently, GOLD provides information for 26 117 Studies, 239 100 Organisms, 15 887 Biosamples, 97 212 Sequencing Projects and 78 579 Analysis Projects. These are integrated with over 312 metadata fields from which 58 are controlled vocabularies with 2067 terms. The web interface facilitates submission of a diverse range of Sequencing Projects (such as isolate genome, single-cell genome, metagenome, metatranscriptome) and complex Analysis Projects (such as genome from metagenome, or combined assembly from multiple Sequencing Projects). GOLD provides a seamless interface with the Integrated Microbial Genomes (IMG) system and supports and promotes the Genomic Standards Consortium (GSC) Minimum Information standards. This paper describes the data updates and additional features added during the last two years.  ",FALSE,FALSE,

PMC5210664,CREATING SEQUENCING PROJECTS IN GOLD,Other,Gs0095506,0,0,0,,,"  CREATING SEQUENCING PROJECTS IN GOLD  GOLD continuously imports publicly available genome and metagenome projects from other resources. If a public sequencing project is not yet in GOLD or a user has a private genome project, which they want to define in GOLD and annotate at IMG, they can use the project entry interface to do that. Each isolate genome Sequencing Project requires an Organism entry in GOLD. Typically a user defines an Organism during project entry process or selects an existing Organism. Part of our manual curation effort is to ensure that all Organisms in GOLD are unique, so it is important not to create duplicate Organism entries. Since GOLD now contains over 230 000 public Organisms, the chances of a user requiring to enter a new Organism is greatly diminished. To facilitate project entry, we have put together a help document (https://gold.jgi.doe.gov/resources/project_help_doc.pdf) listing step-by-step instructions with screenshots, showing how to define different Sequencing and Analysis Projects.

PMC5210664,FUTURE DEVELOPMENT PLANS,Other,Gs0095506,0,0,0,,,"  FUTURE DEVELOPMENT PLANS  GOLD's future development plans can be broadly classified into the following six categories. They are (i) Data acquisition, (ii) Expanding metadata fields, (iii) Metadata packages, (iv) Scalable metadata curation (v) User interface and search enhancements and (vi) implementing unique identifiers.  Data acquisition  We will continue to import genome and metagenomic projects from external resources like NCBI's GenBank and SRA into GOLD. This is an ongoing process with ever increasing data in public domain with more and more complex Studies and associated metadata. It is a constant challenge to fine-tune our semi-automatic import scripts that generate data for manual checks. Our future efforts will be focused on gaining efficiencies on the overall import process as well as on projects that we can process through IMG pipeline.  Expanding metadata fields  We are constantly adding new metadata fields and/or reorganizing existing fields to best suit the needs of emerging research projects. As newer and cheaper technologies make it possible to pursue studies with diverse aims and scope, it necessitates to expand metadata fields. Studies like built environment metagenomes, deep ocean samples, upper atmospheric samples etc. are few diverse examples that require specific set of metadata fields. GOLD currently supports such diverse Studies by accommodating new metadata fields.  Metadata packages  Specific Studies require a unique set of metadata fields that in general may not be applicable across all Biosamples or Organisms in GOLD. In such cases there is a need to implement specific metadata packages. For example biogas reactor Biosamples require a set of unique metadata fields as shown in Figure 5. We plan to expand across similar metadata packages in the near future.  Scalable metadata curation  GOLD's current metadata quality and consistency is due to manual curation. However, it is understandable that manual curation cannot scale at the level of data growth. Much of the future operations in this direction will concentrate on developing automatic or semi-automatic Quality Control (QC) checks for metadata, as well as developing more accurate text mining and natural language processing approaches that would parse the existing wealth of metadata available in the literature (44–46). Crowdsourcing could be another mechanism to maintain curation quality that will be explored (47,48).  User interface (UI) and search enhancements  GOLD users interact with our database through UI both to enter new Projects and search GOLD for public Projects. The new Advanced Search feature we described in this paper is aimed at our user needs to explore GOLD's different levels seamlessly. We will continue to develop the Advanced Search feature to include more metadata fields. It is certainly tedious to enter multiple samples with more or less similar metadata. Also some of the critical metadata for environmental samples such as geo-location, latitude, longitude, altitude, collection date, etc. are now captured by researchers in the field using portable devices like smartphones. Because of these changes in how information is captured, we will explore the implementation of a smartphone app to capture metadata at the time of sample collection in field. We also plan to develop and support the option of loading multiple projects using a batch loading process.  Digital object identifier  We plan to obtain DOIs for organisms and APs in GOLD. DOIs are persistent identifiers used to uniquely identify objects and will help our users in referring to GOLD/IMG data in their publications as well as on any digital platforms.  Figure 5.

PMC5210664,GOLD DATA SOURCES,Other,Gs0095506,0,0,0,,,"  GOLD DATA SOURCES  Data in GOLD are imported from three main sources: (i) projects deposited by users, (ii) projects imported from public resources like NCBI's BioProject and BioSample databases (39) and (iii) projects sequenced at JGI. User entered data are regularly monitored for data accuracy and consistency. The later two are imported into GOLD using semi-automatic import processes after manual checks. Out of the total 97 212 public Sequencing Projects in GOLD, 13 140 were entered by users, 24 923 are JGI projects and 59 149 were imported from external resources.  ",FALSE,TRUE,
PMC5210664,GOLD FEATURE AND DATA UPDATES SINCE LAST RELEASE,Other,Gs0095506,0,1,0,,Cited as an example of a new metadata scheme in a database,"  GOLD FEATURE AND DATA UPDATES SINCE LAST RELEASE  Change has always been constant in GOLD as it continues to develop and evolve over the years to keep up with the growing demands of the larger scientific community. Since the last release (6) there were several key updates to the database. New features were added for better data organization, increased efficiency and to make it more intuitive and user-friendly. GOLD also grew significantly with respect to the volume of data that was incorporated over the last couple of years. Below we list some of the major updates both in terms of new features and data since the last release.  New features  A select list of new features added to GOLD since our last release are Bifurcation of Organism and Biosample, Advanced Search, Metadata Packages and New Combined Assembly Analysis Project Types.  Bifurcation of Organism and Biosample  As described earlier, a GOLD Biosample refers to a physical sample from which genetic material (DNA or RNA) is isolated for subsequent Sequencing Projects. In the previous version of GOLD, a Biosample entity was defined/created for environmental samples as well as organisms including isolate and uncultured single cell organisms. Traditionally environmental samples were pursued for metagenome and metatranscriptome projects. In some cases, single cells were isolated from environmental samples for genome sequencing. Having a Biosample entity both for environmental samples and organisms created some confusion among our users, with a question why a separate Biosample entity in GOLD is required if all the metadata for a particular organism can be captured and organized at the Organism level itself. Also it puts undue burden on users who enter projects manually. Users were previously required to enter both a Biosample and an Organism if it was not already present in GOLD. To clearly distinguish between environmental samples and organisms, better organize metadata as well as to reduce the data entry burden on our users, we decided to bifurcate the Biosample, as defined in earlier versions of GOLD, into Biosample and Organism entities. As shown in Figure 1, GOLD Biosamples now specifically refer to environmental samples. Organisms will not have a Biosample entry, instead all the metadata is now stored at the Organism level. As a way to support our users and reduce their data entry burden we have added a large number of Organisms from the StrainInfo database (30) to GOLD.  Advanced Search  We implemented the Advanced Search feature to allow users to explore GOLD's different project levels such as Study, Biosample/Organism, Sequencing Projects and Analysis Projects. In earlier versions, one had to perform several iterations of the individual search feature and track those results offline from one search to another. Our current implementation of the Advanced Search feature (Figure 4A) is designed to eliminate those shortcomings. Now a user can apply multiple metadata filters across different levels to explore GOLD. For example, the current advanced search feature enables the search for a list of finished whole-genome sequencing projects with GenBank IDs from Gram positive, aerobic bacteria. As shown in Figure 4B, this advanced search allows searching GOLD by applying six different metadata filtering criteria across three different levels. Search results are organized and presented with hits at all levels, with a clickable link on the number of results. By clicking on the number, a list of corresponding GOLD entries filtered by the complex search criteria outlined above are retrieved. For instance, clicking on Analysis Projects, a list of Analysis Projects from Advanced Search results page are displayed (Figure 4C). The Analysis Projects list/table can be explored as previously by selecting/adding new columns for display and filtering on those columns. At the top of the results page there are several options for exploring advanced search results. These include: (i) remove one or more of the already applied filters; (ii) refine current filters by adding new filters or removing already applied filters and (iii) launch a new search. In another example of the Advanced Search feature, if a user is interested in metagenome projects from Thermal springs whose analysis was completed after January 2014 the following filtering criteria will be applied:  Figure 4.  Advanced Search feature in GOLD. (A) Advanced Search launch page in GOLD with a brief explanation of how to conduct an advanced search. (B) Advanced Search results after applying six different search filters across three GOLD levels. (C) List of GOLD Analysis Projects obtained from the Advanced Search.  Biosample.Ecosystem → Environmental, Biosample.Ecosystem Category → Aquatic, Biosample.Ecosystem Type → Thermal springs, Project.Sequencing Strategy → Metagenome, Analysis Project.Completion Date → >01-01-2014.  Metadata packages  For each of the four project levels, a defined set of metadata fields allows users to describe their entries in GOLD. Metadata fields are being constantly expanded with new entries to accommodate specific needs of the user. For example, in the current version, GOLD Organisms contain metadata fields specific to ocean ecosystems (http://www.nodc.noaa.gov/OC5/woa13/) such as Longhurst Code, World Ocean Atlas (WOA) Temperature, WOA Salinity etc. that capture metadata related to marine cyanobacteria and their phages. However, occasionally, Biosamples or Organisms may be submitted with a specific set of metadata that are not part of GOLD's standard set of metadata fields. In these cases GOLD cannot capture these specific metadata. To address this shortfall and to promote extended metadata acquisition and curation efforts, GOLD now supports metadata packages. We implemented a custom Biogas/Reactor metadata package to capture specific metadata applicable for samples coming from biogas reactors. As shown in Figure 5, Biogas/Reactor package supports close to twenty specific metadata fields that are unique to samples from Biogas reactors. These include biogas plant substrate, retention time, yield, total organic carbon, methane percentage etc.  Figure 5.  Description of a GOLD Metadata Package. Biosample populated using the Biogas/Reactor metadata package. All the different metadata categories that are unique to bioreactor samples are listed here.  New Combined Assembly Analysis Project types  Frequently, raw sequencing data from multiple Sequencing Projects (typically metagenomes, but often single cells as well) are co-assembled in order to generate better assemblies. In order to capture this information in GOLD, a Combined Assembly AP is created that is connected to multiple SPs. A combined assembly generally results in a higher number of well-characterized contigs, leading to a better taxonomic and functional annotation of sequence data. For example, a combination of combined assembly and genome binning of high-throughput metagenome sequences of microbial communities (from GOLD study Gs0095506) led to the identification of previously unknown bacterial species from biogas plants in Germany (40). The previous version of GOLD supported combined assemblies among metagenome projects only. The current version supports creation of combined assemblies consisting of the following types of Sequencing Projects: (i) Metagenome SPs, (ii) Metatranscriptome SPs, (iii) Single-cell SPs and (iv) Metagenomic project with Single-Cells. As shown in Table 2, GOLD currently has 109 APs that are defined as Combined Assemblies.  Data updates since last release  Major data updates to GOLD since our last release include the addition of Public Organisms, Sequence Read Archive (SRA) based metagenomes and support for NCBI Multi-isolate Project imports.  Import of public Organisms into GOLD  A new Organism can be created by a user while entering a SP or as part of GOLD's public Sequencing Projects import pipeline from an external resource such as NCBI. When a new Organism is entered by a user there is always a possibility of creating a duplicate entry in GOLD. Potential errors can also creep in if the genus, species, strain or other phylogeny fields of the new Organism are not accurately recorded. Additionally, Organisms that are imported from multiple external sources often require additional curation due to inconsistent quality control standards at other resources. To address these problems, GOLD imported over 150 000 publicly available organisms from the StrainInfo database (30). These Organisms entered are in accordance with standard taxonomic conventions. This expanded set of new Organisms is available for the user to select from when creating a new Project. The availability of these Organisms in GOLD is expected to speed up the Project creation process and also help to reduce manual errors in the process, at least for the Organisms already described.  Import of SRA based metagenomes and associated metadata  The NCBI SRA database (41) stores large volumes of raw sequence data for metagenomic samples. Earlier versions of GOLD did not import metagenome BioProjects or their associated SRA information from NCBI although some select studies were manually entered by GOLD users. The current release supports the systematic import of metagenome projects from NCBI's SRA database. As part of this import process, GOLD has incorporated information from a number of non-amplicon, Illumina-based SRA Runs. Currently GOLD has information for 858 SRA Studies corresponding to 11 914 SRA Experiments and 19 645 Runs. Data from these Projects are subsequently passed on to the IMG assembly and annotation pipeline and are eventually integrated into the IMG system and released to the public.  Incorporation of NCBI Multi-isolate projects  GOLD regularly imports projects from external resources. NCBI BioProject/GenBank is a major source for our external imports. Previously NCBI used to have separate BioProjects for each genome sequencing project. When these projects were imported into GOLD, each Project was associated to a unique NCBI BioProject ID. Recently NCBI introduced the concept of multi-isolate BioProjects where multiple isolate genomes are grouped under a single BioProject ID. To accommodate for this change, GOLD revamped its project import process. The current version of the GOLD database includes over 11 500 multi-isolate Projects. NCBI multi-isolate projects are now a regular component of GOLD's semi-automatic genome import pipeline and as a result GOLD SPs currently have a one-to-one analogy with a NCBI BioSample, in order to account for the inclusion of multi-isolate projects.

PMC5210664,GOLD METADATA STATISTICS,Other,Gs0095506,0,0,0,,,"  GOLD METADATA STATISTICS  The four project levels of GOLD have a total of 312 metadata fields out of which 58 are represented by controlled vocabularies (CV) and the remaining are free text fields (Table 3). The 58 CVs comprise a total of 2067 CV terms. At all four levels of GOLD around 45 metadata fields are mandatory fields. The most well populated fields across metagenome projects/biosamples are ecosystem classification, habitat, geographic location, latitude, longitude, etc. Among isolate Organism based Sequencing Projects, Organism specific fields such as taxonomy information (genus, species, strain, NCBI taxonomy id, phylogeny) and Organism specific metadata such as Gram stain, cell shape, color, isolation site and habitat are commonly populated fields. Organisms identified as type strains tend to posses more metadata in GOLD. Organisms associated with specific Studies list metadata relevant to that initiative. For example, HMP project associated Organisms often list host name, host body site, subsite, body product and disease.  Table 3.

PMC5210664,GOLD OVERVIEW AND CURRENT STATUS,Other,Gs0095506,0,0,0,,,"  GOLD OVERVIEW AND CURRENT STATUS  GOLD data structure  GOLD is based on a four level classification system to clearly distinguish and organize different entities for better tracking and metadata management. The four levels are Study, Biosample or Organism, Sequencing Project (SP) and Analysis Project (AP). Each level holds a unique set of metadata fields and is connected to one or more levels in a hierarchical fashion.  GOLD Study  A Study represents the top level in GOLD's four level organization scheme (Figure 1). Studies broadly represent the umbrella project or the overall goal of a research proposal that a researcher sets out to explore. A GOLD Study can consist of any number of genome Sequencing Projects, e.g. the HMP under which several hundred genome projects were completed (11). While the majority of the Studies in GOLD involve either isolate genome or metagenome SPs, there are several cases where multiple sequencing strategies (such as isolate genome, single-cell genome, transcriptome, metagenome, metatranscriptome and others) are pursued under a single Study. Currently, 26 117 Studies are reported in GOLD. Since the last update, the number of Studies has increased by approximately 7000.  Figure 1.  Four level classification system of the Genomes OnLine Database (GOLD) database. A Study lies at the helm of the project classification system in GOLD and is comprised of either Biosamples or Organisms, which in turn form their respective Sequencing Projects. The assembly and analysis of GOLD Sequencing Projects culminate into Analysis Projects, which are passed on to the Integrated Microbial Genomes (IMG) data management and analysis system.  GOLD Biosample  The GOLD Biosample corresponds to the physical material collected from the environment, and by effect represent the descriptor of the metadata that is associated with an environmental sample. GOLD's Biosample allows the connection of multiple Sequencing Projects to a single physical sample (e.g. a metagenome, a metatranscriptome and several single cell genome projects may be originating from the same environmental material). Metadata associated with GOLD Biosamples include data such as the description of the ecosystem, habitat, place of isolation etc. Rich metadata facilitates comparative analysis as well as helping to drive new discoveries through the availability of specific and accurate metadata. For example, having fine-grained metadata was instrumental in mapping the biogeography of marine viral sequences to different ecological regions of the ocean such as estuaries, coastal waters, coastal sediments and to different depths like surface water, deep ocean, hydrothermal vents and more (7). GOLD's definition of Biosample is conceptually different from the NCBI's BioSample that encompasses both organism and environmental samples. While a GOLD Biosample may be associated with more than one Sequencing Project, a separate BioSample is required for each sequencing project submitted to NCBI. As an example, the chromosome and the plasmid of a single organism may be under a single NCBI BioProject (e.g. PRJNA48991) but under two different NCBI BioSample IDs. Overall, 174 of the GOLD's Biosamples are associated with more than one Sequencing Project, connecting different sequencing strategies to the same original sample. Currently there are 15 887 Biosamples in GOLD distributed across Environmental (47%), Host-associated (35.7%) and Engineered (17.3%) ecosystems.  GOLD Organism  An Organism in GOLD corresponds to any living biological material (virus, bacteria, fungus, plant or animal) that is associated to a Sequencing Project. A GOLD Organism may be cultured or uncultured (such as single cells) and can be linked to more than one Sequencing Project. For example, one organism may be sequenced by different research groups to address similar or different research questions. There are two main sources for new Organism entries in GOLD. One is through the regular addition of a new Sequencing Project, where a new Organism has to be entered (if not already available in the system). The second is a mass import of cultured organisms from StrainInfo (30) most of which are not yet associated with a Sequencing Project. These organisms are readily available for researchers to choose from while creating a new Sequencing Project in GOLD. Currently, there are 239 100 Organisms in GOLD from which 76 759 are associated with 81 289 Sequencing Projects. Using the strain mapping information provided from StrainInfo (30), equivalent strains from different culture collections are mapped to a single Organism in GOLD.  One important metadata field associated with the Organism in GOLD is the information on whether an Organism represents a type strain (31). A type strain is the strain used when the species was first described. Authors reporting a new species usually also designate the type strain of the species. Type strains are maintained in at least two independent culture collections and serve as reference point for a species. As per ‘International Code of Nomenclature of Prokaryotes’ (32) these are referred to as the ‘nomenclatural type of the species’. GOLD acquires type strain information through a collaboration with NamesforLife (www.namesforlife.com), publicly available information at culture collections and the literature. GOLD currently has 11 096 type strains with Sequencing Projects associated with 3321. A total of 186 type strains have more than one Sequencing Project. A total of 10 809 of the types strains in GOLD also have a digital object identifier (DOI), which uniquely identifies each GOLD Organism and can be used as a direct reference in publications or online platforms.  GOLD's Organism classification conform to NCBI's taxonomy conventions (33). Several taxonomy specific fields like genus, species, strain, NCBI taxonomy id and phylogeny are mandatory for registering a new organism in GOLD. Additional organism-specific information such as type strain, culture collection ID, Gram stain, phenotype, motility, oxygen requirement, biotic relationship and others are also available at the Organism level, along with other environmental metadata. Figure 2 shows the geographic distribution of GOLD's Biosamples and Organisms that were collected from different parts of the globe. A total of 73% of Biosamples and 10% of the Organisms that are associated with sequencing projects have geographic location information in GOLD.  Figure 2.  Geographic Distribution of GOLD Biosamples and Organisms. Organism location of isolation is marked in pink while Biosample location of collection is denoted with blue dots.  GOLD Sequencing Project  A GOLD Sequencing Project represents the sequencing output from an individual Organism or Biosample. Recent developments in sequencing technologies have resulted in a wide array of sequencing strategies that can be applied to a biological or environmental sample. As such, several different types of Sequencing Projects are available in GOLD, ranging from isolate WGS, single cell sequencing, targeted gene surveys, transcriptomes, metagenomes, metatranscriptomes and more (Table 1). Currently GOLD has 97 212 SPs with 71 295 WGS projects spread across bacteria (81.3%), eukaryotes (10.5%), virus (6.5%) and archaea (1.7%) followed by metagenome and metatranscriptome projects. An interesting observation comparing the metadata fields from GOLD Sequencing Projects is shown in Figure 3. In terms of the total number of Sequencing Projects, Broad Institute leads the way; however, over the years, the Joint Genome Institute (JGI) has sequenced a significantly diverse selection of organisms (in terms of unique genus and species) than any other sequencing center.  Figure 3.  Sequencing projects across top sequencing centers.

A GOLD AP is required for submitting a data set to IMG for analysis. Each Sequencing Project in GOLD can have one or more APs associated with it. For example, a user can apply multiple assembly techniques to the same raw sequence data (i.e. same Sequencing Project) and have them annotated in IMG. However, each AP can drive a single submission to IMG, so that a one-to-one relation is preserved between a GOLD AP and an IMG Taxon OID (i.e. data set). Only one annotated AP can be part of IMG's reference data set and is designated as primary AP. The primary AP denotes the default assembly and annotation of a Sequencing Project. A reanalysis AP is created when a user has reassembled or reannotated a data set and would like to compare the results with those of the primary AP, which already exists in IMG. There is no limit on the number of reanalysis APs that can be issued from a user. The prerequisite for creating a reanalysis AP is that a primary AP must already exist. A user can also convert a reanalysis AP to a primary AP. Different metadata fields of an AP gather information about the data processing methods that differentiate one AP from another. Currently there are 78 579 Analysis Projects in GOLD, which is more than twice the number of APs since our last release. A total of 68% of the APs have been submitted to IMG and have an IMG Taxon OID. Over 56 000 Analysis Projects are for individual genomes, 92% of which have a GenBank ID (34).  Table 2 lists the different Analysis Project types in GOLD. Driven by the absence of appropriate culturing techniques and improvement in bioinformatics methods to assemble environmental sequences, there has been a recent increase in the number of partial or near-complete reconstruction of genomes from metagenomes (GFMs) (35). Accordingly, GOLD has observed a marked increase in the number of GFM APs. Since GFMs are not direct product of sequencing an individual organism (either an isolate or a single cell), but rather computationally derived from a metagenome, they are not directly connected to an SP. Instead, they are connected to an AP of a metagenome SP. Single-cell genomics is another example where uncultured microbes were isolated from environmental samples (36). While sequence contamination is common in isolate genomes (37), single amplified genome extraction, being a nascent technology, is equally prone to contamination and often requires extensive decontamination procedures (38). Thus, to differentiate APs that have gone through a thorough contamination check from those that have not, GOLD has two different kinds of single-cell APs, namely, single cell analysis (screened) and single-cell analysis (unscreened). Transcriptome, metatranscriptome, 16S based targeted metagenome assembly and an expanded range of combined assembly APs (discussed later) make up the remaining different types of Analysis Projects in the current version of GOLD.

PMC5210664,INTRODUCTION,Introduction,Gs0095506,0,0,0,,,"  INTRODUCTION  The Genomes OnLine Database (GOLD) is a data management system for the curation and visualization of sequencing projects pursued around the world. Ever since its first release (1) and subsequent updates (2–6), GOLD has been a pioneering centralized public resource for monitoring sequencing projects and their associated metadata, promoting comparative analyses and groundbreaking discoveries through biological translation of sequence data (7–9). An important component in the analysis and interpretation of sequence data is the availability of high quality and accurate metadata. With the increasing amounts of sequence data released in the public domain, without an accurate account of metadata any comparative analysis will be less meaningful and prone to misinterpretations. GOLD carries the critical role in providing manually curated metadata from the literature and various other resources, enabling more efficient comparative analysis of sequence data. The data are provided to the community through a login free, user-friendly web interface. Thus, GOLD serves as the curated catalogue of world wide sequencing projects as well as a central resource of curated metadata records.  The decreasing sequencing costs coupled with continuous improvements in sequencing and longer read technologies are driving the continuation of doubling the amount of data produced every seven months over the past 10 years (10). These technological developments have enabled several large scale sequencing efforts including the Human Microbiome Project (HMP) (11), 1000 Fungal Genomes (12), Genomic Encyclopedia of Bacteria and Archaea (13–15) and others. More recently, single cell genomics from environmental samples (16), i.e. sequencing the genome from a single cell, and genomes reconstructed from metagenomes have significantly increased our ability to sequence phylogenetically diverse and hitherto uncultured organisms. A growing number of Sequencing Projects in GOLD during the last few years are from genomes of uncultured organisms with these approaches leading to characterizing the genome of several new phyla (17–20).  GOLD serves as the entry point for all the projects submitted for analysis to the Integrated Microbial Genomes (IMG) data management systems (21,22) and ensures that projects are correctly defined along with their necessary metadata before being passed on to the IMG pipelines for annotation (23,24). GOLD also supports the International community-driven standards of the Genomics Standards Consortium (25) and is fully compliant with its recommendations for Minimum Information about any (x) Sequence (MIxS) standards (26). Documenting and organizing metadata in a centralized database that serves both as a worldwide catalogue and as an entry point for annotation and comparative analysis, has been shown to be very convenient for the users (27). Documented metadata in GOLD can be readily accessed to create genome reports for journals such as Standards in Genomic Sciences (28).  The increase in the number of sequencing projects worldwide and the diversity of research studies coupled with novel and sophisticated analysis approaches users are applying for their data, is driving the need for a more flexible project and metadata management system. In addition, there is a constant need for new metadata fields, intuitive search mechanisms and new approaches to data analysis. These are some of the main requirements that have driven the development of GOLD since its last major update two years ago. An Advanced Search feature, custom metadata package for biogas reactor and support for NCBI's data imports (29) are few of the major updates described in this paper.  ",FALSE,TRUE,

The total number and different types of Studies, Biosamples, Organisms, SPs and APs are computed on a daily basis and presented in a table with hyperlinks on the GOLD home page. A brief summary of the different menu tabs in the GOLD web user interface is provided below:  Search  The search option enables a user to query the GOLD database within its multi-level project classification system and different metadata categories. The search drop-down menu is categorized into (i) Advanced Search that is designed to query GOLD across a suite of multiple project features and metadata fields, all at the same time and (ii) Metadata Search that allows the user to search GOLD using metadata identifiers and provides a graphical as well as tabular output of the results.  Distribution Graphs  Data summary of different types of Sequencing Projects, sequencing status, Organism phylogenetic classification, Biosample ecosystem classifications, etc. are provided as pre-computed pie charts and tables in the ‘Distribution Graphs’ section of the GOLD UI.  Biogeographical Metadata  The Biogeographical Metadata section displays the geographic location of GOLD Biosamples and Organisms using the map and terrain components of Google map. The interactive maps in this segment can be zoomed in or out to focus on a specific geo-location to search for specific Biosamples/Organisms from that region.  Statistics  The statistics component of the GOLD UI consists of graphs and charts encompassing several different metadata categories from Sequencing Projects. A user can access the summary statistics of the growth of genome Sequencing Projects, as they were added in GOLD over the years and also look at their breakdown by sequencing status or project completeness. Pre-computed pie-charts displaying the distribution of projects by relevance or by sequencing centers are also available in the GOLD statistics page.  ",FALSE,TRUE,

PMC5435917,Abstract,Abstract,NC_006526,0,0,0,,,"  Abstract  Current approaches to design efficient antisense RNAs (asRNAs) rely primarily on a thermodynamic understanding of RNA–RNA interactions. However, these approaches depend on structure predictions and have limited accuracy, arguably due to overlooking important cellular environment factors. In this work, we develop a biophysical model to describe asRNA–RNA hybridization that incorporates in vivo factors using large-scale experimental hybridization data for three model RNAs: a group I intron, CsrB and a tRNA. A unique element of our model is the estimation of the availability of the target region to interact with a given asRNA using a differential entropic consideration of suboptimal structures. We showcase the utility of this model by evaluating its prediction capabilities in four additional RNAs: a group II intron, Spinach II, 2-MS2 binding domain and glgC 5΄ UTR. Additionally, we demonstrate the applicability of this approach to other bacterial species by predicting sRNA–mRNA binding regions in two newly discovered, though uncharacterized, regulatory RNAs.

PMC5435917,DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS,Conclusion,NC_006526,0,0,0,,,"  DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS  The inTherAcc model incorporates a series of thermodynamic terms to account for energetics of intramolecular folding, intermolecular binding and the target region availability using the Boltzmann distribution of possible structural configurations. The novelty of this approach lies in the integration of large scale in vivo data as well as the interplay between the components of target accessibility as understood by (i) an availability factor based on suboptimal structures and (ii) thermodynamic consideration of RNA unfolding, identified during model optimization. Our results suggest that the family of inTher models that we have developed could assist current asRNA predictions to capture ‘hybridizability’ in vivo. Our work also highlights the potential of using in vivo experimental data sets to increase prediction accuracy for effective selection of sites for asRNA targeting and provides a methodology to do so. The observed relationship between target RNA folding energy and regional target availability as estimated by a summation of local base-pairing probabilities was shown via statistical model optimization (Figure 4 and Supplementary Table S3) and suggests that scaling this free energy by its availability factor plays a significant role in determining efficacy of RNA hybridization in vivo. Other research groups have used similar scaling approaches with significant improvements in the performance of siRNA design and predictions (60,92–93). The main difference of our scaling scheme relative to these previous efforts is its regional nature. While previous works scaled the stacking energies of interacting nucleotides one by one according to nucleotide-specific base-pairing probabilities, this approach assumes that any given asRNA behaves as an indivisible unit. In addition, this in vivo optimization has brought about coefficients for our model that are meaningful in capturing intracellular behavior. For instance, as expected, we observed a strong influence of the intramolecular structure of the target region on the hybridization efficacy (Figure 4). Moreover, the estimated coefficients could be indicators of the presence of binding factors, the effect of molecular crowding or even the presence of ionic species in the cellular milieu. For example, divalent ion influence on ribozyme active site structural arrangement (94) was likely to an extent accounted for by optimizing inTher models with gI intron data. It is therefore not surprising that the optimized inTherAcc model was an improved predictor of gII intron hybridization efficacy. To the best of our knowledge, no approach in the past has attempted to consider the in vivo environment by optimizing a current biophysical model using large sets of in vivo data collected in bacteria and applying it to predict other RNA molecules, while simultaneously studying the influence of target accessibility.  Through in vivo optimization of model parameters, we achieved a highly reliable qualitative prediction of highly ‘hybridizable’ regions in a wide array of RNA molecules. Overall, the inTherAcc model performs at levels above 63% and below 60% in PPV and FNR, correspondingly. Furthermore, inTherAcc predictions are sensitive to known protein and small molecule binding sites in 2-MS2 coat protein binding domain and SpinachII, showcasing its potential to recognize regulatory features within RNAs. It also is at least comparable to benchmark IntaRNA, bearing an advantage in specific cases likely due to the incorporation of in vivo factors during model optimization. Interestingly, some of the observed discrepancies between experimental and predicted hybridization efficacy in the glgC 5΄UTR can be attributed to competitive binding between the asRNA and factors that naturally interact with this RNA that are not fully accounted for by the collected data set. In many of these cases, we suspect that even our experimentally collected data sets fail to capture the full set of molecular interactions (e.g. with other intracellular factors) given that only limited environmental conditions were tested where the full range of these interactions does not occur. This is likely the case for regulatory RNA regions like the glgC UTR, in which different interactions are observed in vivo under nutritional stresses (not tested in this work). As a result, we hypothesize that further prediction accuracy can be achieved for these models by expanding the collected data sets to include a variety of environmental conditions (e.g. cellular stresses) to capture a broader range of interactions.  Remarkably, the inTherAcc approach provides the following general strategies in asRNA design: (i) the suggestion of a free energy interval within which the thermodynamic stability of the asRNA does not seem to influence hybridization efficacy, (ii) the realization that both low and high inTherAcc-predicted hybridization efficacies could indicate functional sites that may be interesting targets for asRNAs and (iii) evidence of the potential influence of suboptimal structures in hybridization efficacy that aids in identification of target dynamic regions. Overall, we envision that the inTherAcc approach will assist in the characterization of newly-identified regulatory RNAs and the design of synthetic elements that require RNA binding through complementarity by improving reliability of RNA targeting performance in vivo, particularly in bacteria.

PMC5435917,INTRODUCTION,Introduction,NC_006526,0,0,0,,,"  INTRODUCTION  In vivo RNA targeting via antisense base pairing provides an efficient mechanism to characterize RNA interactions as well as to post-transcriptionally regulate gene expression. In the native cellular environment, sequence-specific antisense RNAs (asRNAs) are ubiquitous in natural gene regulatory mechanisms, ranging from bacterial small RNAs (sRNAs) (both cis- and trans-encoded) (1–3) to more complex eukaryotic systems such as the RNA interference pathway and circular RNAs (4). Likewise, the common use of affinity-based purification assays to characterize in vivo RNA interactions (i.e. pulldown of a target RNA and its interacting partners from cellular extracts) relies on targeting the RNA of interest with an immobilized bait molecule, often an antisense RNA (5,6). Furthermore, the simplicity and universality of nucleic acid Watson–Crick complementarity makes antisense nucleic acids highly attractive for controlling gene expression (1,7–10) in biotechnological applications such as bacterial cellular engineering (11–14). Given the broad utility of RNA targeting via antisense binding, recent efforts to design effective synthetic asRNAs in bacteria have become more systematic, mimicking mechanisms of natural non-coding RNAs that downregulate their cognate messenger RNAs (mRNAs) by base-pairing (1,3,15). A more recent study in bacteria provided general guidelines for the design of asRNAs using large sets of gene-repression data (16). However, there remains a significant challenge in the asRNA applications described above: the design of effective antisense oligonucleotides for sequence-specific targeting of RNA in situ (3,5). This is particularly true in bacterial systems, since most design models for asRNAs have been developed in the context of eukaryotes.  Rational efforts to design asRNA have traditionally been aided by algorithms that predict RNA–RNA interactions (17,18). These approaches are numerous and stem from simple and fast surveying methods such as GUUGLe (19) and BLAST (20) that score potential target regions within an RNA of interest using the sole criterion of complementarity. These approaches have been followed by several methods that display varying degrees of accuracy and sophistication: from (i) those neglecting intramolecular structure (e.g. RNAduplex (21), RNAhybrid (22), TargetRNA (23) and RNAplex (24)) to (ii) those considering only one interaction site and intramolecular structure (e.g. Nupack (25), RNAup (26), AccessFold (27) and IntaRNA (28)), or even to (iii) those highly computationally complex tools that predict several interactions sites (e.g. IRIS (29)) and the joint RNA–RNA secondary structure using the energy partition function (e.g. PiRNA (30) and RIP (31)). For simplicity, some of these approaches for prediction of RNA–RNA interactions (e.g. RNAup (26) and IntaRNA (28)) rely on RNA ‘accessibility,’ based on the assumption that both interacting partners must be unfolded (i.e. accessible) prior to binding (17). In this context, accessibility is defined as the property of a given potential interaction site to be free of intramolecular base pairs. Target accessibility has been generally introduced in predictive algorithms as an energy penalty estimated from the ensemble of possible target structures with the corresponding target region unpaired. The specific role of target accessibility in the asRNA hybridization has been extensively studied with a particular focus on miRNAs and siRNAs (24,26,32–36). However, there are limitations with the aforementioned structure prediction approaches (e.g. high false positive rate (17) and limited accuracy (70% for molecules up to 500 nt and as low as 40% for longer RNAs (37)) due to simplifications in the energy model that overlook structural complexity and intracellular factors that affect hybridization. Furthermore, to our knowledge, very few works have shed light on how accessibility plays a role in antisense hybridization within living bacteria (38). This underscores the need for more realistic approaches that account for the in vivo environment, incorporating the influence of binding factors, ionic strength and molecular crowding (39).  Hereby, we propose a novel approach to predict and evaluate hybridization efficacy in bacteria that features the inclusion of large sets of experimental data collected in vivo. This model uniquely considers a regional availability factor. Regional characteristics of the target RNA have long been implicated in asRNA efficacy. For instance, Zhao and Lemke proposed a criterion that at least 4 highly accessible nucleotides are necessary for the initiation of asRNA-target RNA binding based on investigating correlations between predicted structure and asRNA efficacy (40). In addition, established RNA hybridization mechanisms further support this notion of ‘regionality’, e.g. the intermediate step in which a few nucleotides interact to initiate the binding (seeding interaction) (41) or recognition sequences that behave as first ‘points of contact,’ such as the YUNR motif (42). To derive a corresponding RNA molecular recognition model, we start from a common thermodynamic framework used in accessibility-based approaches (17) that considers the overall change of free energy of Gibbs \documentclass[12pt]{minimal}  \usepackage{amsmath}  \usepackage{wasysym}   \usepackage{amsfonts}   \usepackage{amssymb}   \usepackage{amsbsy}  \usepackage{upgreek}  \usepackage{mathrsfs}  \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}  \begin{document}  }{}$(\Delta {G_{overall}})$\end{document} in the reaction system, a predictor of asRNA binding (19). We introduce a novel, semi-empirical measure of variable entropic contributions to asRNA binding of the targeted region, which we assume acts as a cohesive stretch of nucleotides within the larger structural context of folded RNA molecules. Lastly, we also optimize the considered models in vivo based on experimental data to account for crowding and other effects of the cellular environment. Hereafter, we refer to this predictive approach as the invivo-optimized Thermodynamic Accessibility-adjusted model, inTherAcc.  The inTherAcc model was developed using large data sets describing in vivo hybridization efficacy of asRNAs targeting approximately 80 regions within three well-studied RNA molecules: the autocatalytic group I (gI) intron from Tetrahymena, and the Escherichia coli noncoding RNAs CsrB and glutamate tRNA. Experimental characterization of asRNA hybridization efficacy was performed using a previously published assay that measures asRNA-target RNA hybridization via fluorescence, the in vivo RNA Structural Sensing System-(IRS3) (43).  Following model optimization, hybridization efficacy of numerous potential target regions within the 2-MS2 phage coat protein transcript (2-MS2), glgC 5΄ UTR (glgC), group II intron (gII) and the Spinach II (SpII) RNAs was predicted and experimentally assessed for accuracy. The performance of our model was benchmarked against a similarly optimized model lacking the proposed availability term and IntaRNA (28), an accessibility-based approach that also considers a regional adjustment by incorporating the existence of a user-definable seed.  Lastly we evaluated the ability of inTherAcc coupled to BLAST (20) to predict mRNA targets of recently discovered Z. mobilis sRNAs, Zms4 and Zms6 (44). Experimental confirmation using RIP-seq validated the ability of inTherAcc to aid prediction of potential mRNA targets for Zms4 and Zms6. Comparison of inTherAcc to IntaRNA predictions suggests complementarity between the prediction approaches. Finally, the demonstration of inTherAcc utility in another bacterial species underscores its broad applicability.  ",FALSE,TRUE,

In this system, a fluorescence shift is observed when an asRNA successfully binds the region of interest in the target RNA. A total of eighty asRNAs targeting unique regions in three target molecules (gI intron, CsrB and tRNA) were analyzed in this work for model optimization purposes. Forty-nine asRNAs targeting unique regions in four different target molecules (gII intron, SpinachII, glgC 5΄UTR and 2-MS2) were also used to assess model prediction capabilities. To construct these experimental asRNA systems, a modified Golden Gate cloning-based plasmid was introduced for high-throughput cloning that included the following changes to the previously published ‘Wild Type Intron Probe I reporter’ (43): a p-chlorophenylalanine negative selection cassette in place of the asRNA sequence (between EcoRI and the CB element flanked by two BsmbI restriction sites) (45,46). We termed this plasmid iRS3 Golden Gate (IRS3-GG) and it is illustrated in Supplementary Figure S1A. All target molecules, with the exception of the natively-targeted tRNA, were separately introduced in the iRS3-GG between the XbaI and SalI restriction sites (see plasmid map in Supplementary Figure S1A). In the case of gII, SpII, glgC and 2-MS2, Gibson assembly (47) (using Gibson Assembly mix from NEB) was performed. CsrB was introduced via traditional restriction cloning. All primers used for cloning of target molecule into iRS3-GG are listed in Supplementary Table S1.  All asRNA sequences within the plasmid (Supplementary Table S2), besides 11 asRNAs corresponding to regions within the gI intron that were previously synthesized and published (43), were either ordered from GenScript Inc., synthesized by a site-directed mutagenesis approach (QuikChange II Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit, Agilent Technologies) by modifying a previously synthesized asRNA, synthesized via Gibson Assembly (47) or synthesized by using a high throughput Golden Gate approach as described in (48) on our iRS3-GG plasmid. For the Golden Gate approach, complementary primers (ordered from IDT) containing each asRNA sequence with the proper flanking overhangs were annealed and cloned after digestion with BsmbI (Thermo Scientific) to replace the p-chlorophenylalanine negative selection cassette. All specific cloning methods and primers used for cloning are included in Supplementary Table S2. To increase cloning throughput, two to five asRNAs were combined into a single reaction and later transformed into DH5α chemically-competent cells or NEB Turbo electro-competent cells and plated in Luria–Bertani (LB)/Agar media supplemented with p-cholorophenylalanine (p-Cl-Phe) to select for the clones harboring the appropriate asRNA. Once the asRNA sequences were confirmed by DNA sequencing, the newly synthesized plasmids were transformed into K-12 MG1655, or, in the case of CsrB, into a CsrB/CsrC-knockout K-12 MG1655 strain (CML 378) (49). An overview of the specifics of the asRNA synthesis strategy is included in Supplementary Figure S1B.  For the evaluation of sRNA target prediction as aided by inTherAcc and IntaRNA, we utilized pBBR1MCS2-pgap vector (50) for constitutive expression. Each sRNA was synthesized by GenScript® and then cloned into pBBR1MCS2-pgap vector between NheI and SalI, resulting in pBBR1MCS2-pgap-sRNA. For 2MS2BD-Zms4/Zms6/control constructs, gBlock® (IDT) of 2MS2BD-Zms4/Zm6/control was used for cloning into pBBR1MCS2-pgap vector, resulting in plasmids abbreviated 2MS2-Zms4/2MS2-Zms6/2MS2-control. These plasmids were transformed by electroporation into Zymomonas mobilis 8b.  Selection of target RNAs  Rationale for target molecule selection was based on molecule complexity, size and functional interactions. For instance, the gI intron is a relatively large (393 nucleotides), well-studied RNA model (51,52) whose many structurally significant regions have been previously probed with the iRS3 system (43). These studies have shown that this autocatalytic molecule may well-represent the complexity of structural features present in most RNAs targeted for regulation (e.g. UTRs of mRNAs (53)). On the contrary, the 76-nucleotide long glutamate–tRNA has a wide assortment of interactions with intracellular factors, including mRNAs, rRNAs, various modification enzymes and other proteins despite exhibiting tight tertiary structure comparable to that of the gI intron (54). The third molecule chosen for model optimization, CsrB, is a non-coding RNA whose multiple protein binding motifs contribute to the translational regulation of a large number of mRNAs (55). Compared to the previously described molecules, CsrB (369 nucleotides) is less structurally sophisticated than the gI intron and the tRNA.  For assessing the prediction capabilities of our model, four alternative RNA molecules were used: the 2-MS2 coat protein binding domain, the model LtrB group II intron, the Spinach II RNA and the glgC messenger RNA 5΄UTR. This set of RNAs covers a wide array of types, functions, structures and sizes. MS2 and Spinach II are commonly used to investigate RNA interactions, more specifically, to isolate RNAs to determine specific RNA interacting complexes (5) and track RNA movement (56), respectively. Similarly, 5΄ UTRs often use their structure to regulate the translation of their associated mRNA. The gII intron was selected given the interest in targeting ribozymes for understanding the molecular mechanisms for catalytic activity, largely regulated by their complex folding (57).  Fluorescence measurements and calculations of asRNA hybridization using the in vivo RNA structural sensing system (iRS3)  In general, flow cytometry experiments were carried out as previously reported (43). All target molecules (except for the glutamate tRNA) were evaluated under overexpression conditions in which the hybridization efficacy is evaluated as the ratio between the fluorescence in the presence of the target RNA with baseline fluorescence (in the absence of the target RNA) subtracted out (FLon-FLoff) to the baseline fluorescence (FLoff). For all hybridization calculations, FLoff was scaled by an adjustment factor of 0.65 to account for the excess abundance of the reporter probe relative to the target RNA, as approximated by recently obtained RNA-sequencing data (unpublished). In the case of the tRNA, the target was evaluated using native levels given its natural presence and abundance in E. coli cells using plasmid in Supplementary Figure S1C. In this case, FLon and FLoff represent the fluorescence in the presence of the asRNA (iRS3+specific oligonucleotide) and the fluorescence in the absence of the asRNA, respectively. FLoff fluorescence was measured right before induction (at time ‘0’) and FLon was collected 45 min after induction (See Supplementary Figure S2A for a correlation between uninduced and time ‘0’). Seeding cultures originated from independent overnights and uninduced and induced samples proceeded from the same initial seeding culture. Specifically, seeding was done in LB (40 ml + 50 μg/ml of kanamycin) and split up into two 20 ml cultures at the time of induction (1–2 h of growth upon seeding) for the collection of model optimization data. When testing model predictions, seeding was done in LB (200 μl + 50 μg/ml of kanamycin) and split up into two 100 μl cultures in 96-well plates at the time of induction.  In vivo DMS footprinting and calculation of target availability (\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}  \usepackage{amsmath}  \usepackage{wasysym}   \usepackage{amsfonts}   \usepackage{amssymb}   \usepackage{amsbsy}  \usepackage{upgreek}  \usepackage{mathrsfs}  \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}  \begin{document}  }{}${\rm{\bar{\theta }}}$\end{document})  The DMS reactivity of the gI intron was obtained using a previously published protocol (43). In this work, we published the in vivo DMS reactivity profile for the full gI intron (Supplementary Figure S3). Previously, the reactivity for only select regions had been published (43). The nucleotide indexing for the gI intron follows the established consensus for this well-known molecule. These data were filtered and normalized using specialized software, the capillary automated footprinting analysis (58). The reactivity values for the untreated sample were subtracted from the average reactivity value of two independent DMS treated samples. The DMS reactivity for Gs and Us was estimated by assuming the same reactivity as their pairing partners (if paired), and, when unpaired, an average reactivity value for ‘exposed’ nucleotides was assigned. Special cases were those Gs and Us exposed in loops (G58, U59, G92, G112, G119, U120, G126, U179, U185, G200, G201, U202, U225, G227, U247, G254, G279, U300, G303, U322, U323, G331, U340, G341, G357, G358, G368 and U372) that were assigned values more similar to their neighbors and other As and Cs present in loops. The regional target availability factor was then calculated using the average of the individual reactivity values of each nucleotide in the given target region over the length of the target region.

Figure 1.  Proposed accessibility-based mechanism of antisense hybridization in living cells. (A) Example target region with color-coded local availability (estimated by base-pairing probabilities) is shown in canonical conformation, as would be expected in the native state. In antisense RNAs (asRNA) targeting by the iRS3, the targeted region must unbind from P3 to become single stranded as shown in (B) with a free energy change of –ΔGTf. The iRS3 consists of four main elements: a cis-blocking strand (CB, orange), a ribosome binding site (RBS, blue), the sequence encoding green fluorescence protein (GFP, green) and the probe (pink and black) of 8–27 nucleotides targeting a specific region shown in (B). The expected native state of the iRS3 is shown in (C), and it must also unfold to bind the target region as shown in (D) with a free energy change of –ΔGasf. Finally, the two unfolded structures bind as in (E) with a free energy change of ΔGasT to stabilize the unfolded iRS3 and allow translation of GFP. Effective asRNA targeting results in a high fluorescence response.

Only canonical base-pairing (Watson–Crick base pairs), penalties for self-complementarity within the asRNA and AU ending were considered for the calculation of the stacking energies.  Calculation of free energy of the target region \documentclass[12pt]{minimal}  \usepackage{amsmath}  \usepackage{wasysym}   \usepackage{amsfonts}   \usepackage{amssymb}   \usepackage{amsbsy}  \usepackage{upgreek}  \usepackage{mathrsfs}  \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}  \begin{document}  }{}$(\Delta {G_{{\rm Tf}}})$\end{document}  To calculate the Gibbs free energy of target region folding, the energy parameters for the nearest neighbor model previously published (59) were used. The target region plus one extra nucleotide at each end was considered to account for stacking contributions of neighboring base pairs. The folding of the target RNA was considered to be a local event due to the tight coupling of prokaryotic transcription and translation. Such assumptions of local folding have previously been used in a structural study of bacterial genes (60). To calculate the stacking energy contributions, the consensus secondary structure of the gI intron was considered (61). For all the other target molecules, a secondary structure prediction from the RNAStructure webserver was used (62). Since GU base pairs are somewhat extensively found in the structure of our target RNAs, they were treated as nearest neighbor stacks, similar to Watson–Crick helices. In addition, the penalty for ending in a GU was the same as an AU ending. In our treatment of GU pairs we followed the parameters reported by Mathews et al. (63). No energy parameters for other structural motifs such as loops, bulges, etc. were taken into account.  Calculation of the availability factor  To support high-throughput estimations of regional availability (\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}  \usepackage{amsmath}  \usepackage{wasysym}   \usepackage{amsfonts}   \usepackage{amssymb}   \usepackage{amsbsy}  \usepackage{upgreek}  \usepackage{mathrsfs}  \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}  \begin{document}  }{}$\bar{\theta }$\end{document}), without involving experimental structural studies, local availability (θk) was estimated by one minus base pairing probabilities determined by Boltzmann-distributed structural variations provided by the Nupack webserver (64). This structural accessibility estimation was shown to be captured by in vivo experimental DMS reactivity at the regional level, supporting the use of base pairing probabilities as an estimator of experimentally determined regional availability (Supplementary Figure S4).  Calculation of free energy of folding for the asRNA \documentclass[12pt]{minimal}  \usepackage{amsmath}  \usepackage{wasysym}   \usepackage{amsfonts}   \usepackage{amssymb}   \usepackage{amsbsy}  \usepackage{upgreek}  \usepackage{mathrsfs}  \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}  \begin{document}  }{}$(\Delta {G_{{\rm asf}}})$\end{document}  The ‘allSub’ subroutine of the RNAStructure webserver (62) was used to predict the secondary structure of the asRNA+iRS3 transcript (5΄-6 nt + asRNA + 56 nt-3΄). The Gibbs free energy of the minimum free energy structure was used to represent the asRNA folding energy \documentclass[12pt]{minimal}  \usepackage{amsmath}  \usepackage{wasysym}   \usepackage{amsfonts}   \usepackage{amssymb}   \usepackage{amsbsy}  \usepackage{upgreek}  \usepackage{mathrsfs}  \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}  \begin{document}  }{}$(\Delta {G_{{\rm asf}}})$\end{document}. For the purpose of this analysis, the transcript considered 62 nucleotides in addition to the 8–27 nucleotides of the asRNA (for a total of 70–89 nucleotides). Additionally, six nucleotides upstream of the asRNA were included as part of the transcript to account for imprecision of transcriptional start sites. In this way, any potential interactions between the asRNA and the segment downstream from the ribosomal binding site (RBS) site were accounted for. The specific sequence is as follows: 5΄GAA UUC -asRNA- UAC CAU UCA CCU CUU GGA UUU GGG UAU UAA AGA GGA GAA AGG UAC CAU GAG UAA AG 3΄.  Model optimization via regression analysis using experimental hybridization data  Regression analysis was used to statistically evaluate the contributions of the proposed biophysical factors in the derived models. Briefly, a linear model relating the experimental response variable υ (defined as the logarithm of the ratio of (FLon-Floff) to Floff measurements) to the previously described factors \documentclass[12pt]{minimal}  \usepackage{amsmath}  \usepackage{wasysym}   \usepackage{amsfonts}   \usepackage{amssymb}   \usepackage{amsbsy}  \usepackage{upgreek}  \usepackage{mathrsfs}  \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}  \begin{document}  }{}$(\bar{\theta },\Delta {G_{{\rm asT}}},\Delta {G_{{\rm Tf}}},\Delta {G_{{\rm asf}}})$\end{document} was composed and the coefficients for the various factors were fit by ordinary least squares regression. Coefficient fitting and statistical analysis of parameter contributions to the overall model were performed using MatLab Math, Statistics and Optimization package (specifically ‘fitlm’ function). A total of 383 independent fluorescence measurements (representing asRNA hybridization efficiency) across all three optimization molecules were used for regression analysis. \documentclass[12pt]{minimal}  \usepackage{amsmath}  \usepackage{wasysym}   \usepackage{amsfonts}   \usepackage{amssymb}   \usepackage{amsbsy}  \usepackage{upgreek}  \usepackage{mathrsfs}  \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}  \begin{document}  }{}$\Delta {G_{{\rm asf}}}$\end{document} was constrained to an interval between −19.3 kCal/mol and −17.8 kCal/mol where its influence became statistically insignificant (P-value > 0.05) allowing the other more relevant factors \documentclass[12pt]{minimal}  \usepackage{amsmath}  \usepackage{wasysym}   \usepackage{amsfonts}   \usepackage{amssymb}   \usepackage{amsbsy}  \usepackage{upgreek}  \usepackage{mathrsfs}  \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}  \begin{document}  }{}$(\bar{\theta },\Delta {G_{{\rm asT}}},\Delta {G_{{\rm Tf}}})$\end{document} to be studied in isolation (see Supplementary Figure S5). In addition, the predictors in Equation ((8)) were normalized by the length of the asRNA to decrease linear dependency on this design parameter. A 3-fold cross-validation was performed to test for prediction ability for both optimized models (groups were randomly selected and all replicates were kept together based on their corresponding region). Each cross-validated R2 was calculated as the adjusted coefficient of determination of the linear regression fit between the experimental data of each independent group and corresponding predicted values from a model derived from the remaining 2 independent groups.  For all regression analyses conducted in this work, factors and their potential interactions were considered statistically meaningful if their P-value (t-test) was lower than 0.005. Additionally, the quality of the regression was qualitatively evaluated by visual inspection, ensuring that the residuals showed a strong normal distribution (see Supplementary Figure S6).  Selection of target regions for evaluation of model prediction ability  About 1300 potential target regions within each molecule (gII intron, SpinachII, glgC 5΄UTR, 2-MS2) were randomly generated. Starting from the first nucleotide of the molecule, regions of random length between 9 and 17 nucleotides were designed sequentially with one nucleotide overlap between each region. This process was iterated 7 additional times with respect to integer-increasing nucleotide overlap between regions, ultimately producing 8 sets of target regions with 1–8 nucleotide overlaps. To ensure that every nucleotide of each molecule was included within each set of target regions, the last region within each set was not of random length. Instead, if the first nucleotide of a prospective region was within 9–17 nt of the last nucleotide, the final probe of the respective iteration was established as the region from the first nucleotide of the prospective region to the last nucleotide of the molecule. The full set of asRNAs targeting these regions was then filtered by their calculated folding free energies to select a subset of 366 asRNAs with \documentclass[12pt]{minimal}  \usepackage{amsmath}  \usepackage{wasysym}   \usepackage{amsfonts}   \usepackage{amssymb}   \usepackage{amsbsy}  \usepackage{upgreek}  \usepackage{mathrsfs}  \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}  \begin{document}  }{}$\Delta {G_{{\rm asf}}}$\end{document} ranging from −19.3 to −17.8 kcal/mol.  Lastly, this filtered set of asRNA designs was used to predict hybridization efficacies via the optimized model. The total number and sequence of asRNAs for experimental validation for each RNA were chosen based on molecule length, biophysical model hybridization prediction and targeting region. Six asRNAs were chosen for the smallest target molecule (2-MS2), 13 for the ‘mid-sized’ molecules (glgC 5΄UTR and Spinach II) and 17 for the largest (gII intron). Approximately 40% of asRNAs for each molecule were selected for their low predicted hybridization values, defined as a predicted hybridization efficacy equal to or less than the median of the asRNA pool within a molecule. The remaining asRNAs selected were within the predicted high hybridization efficacy pool, specifically, with predicted hybridization greater than the median. Precautions were taken to avoid selection of asRNAs targeting highly similar regions (>5 shared nucleotides); however, exceptions were made when two asRNAs targeting similar regions showed interesting differences in terms of predicted hybridization efficacy (differences greater than the standard error of the pool).  Statistical evaluation of model prediction ability  For each target region designed for experimental validation (above), hybridization efficacies as predicted by benchmark software IntaRNA were also estimated (28). First, the hybridization energy of each region was calculated using the pre-set seed, folding and output parameters with inputs of target RNA sequence and asRNA sequence. The hybridization energy was then normalized by the length of the asRNA oligonucleotide. The lowest (most negative) normalized energy values indicated a higher predicted hybridization potential. Predicted (by both in vivo-optimized models and IntaRNA) and experimental hybridization efficacies for each of the 4 molecules were then linearly scaled to fall between 0 and 1. To statistically evaluate the prediction potential of our models, experimental and predicted ‘high’ hybridization efficacy was defined as any hybridization efficacy greater than one standard deviation above the hybridization efficacy mean of points below the median within experimental and predicted subsets, respectively. Any points below these thresholds were considered to have ‘low’ hybridization efficacies within their categories. To evaluate the performance of our models, we also calculated the positive predictive value (PPV) of regions with high hybridization potential and the false negative rate (FNR) of regions with low hybridization efficacy defined in this specific context as follows:  \documentclass[12pt]{minimal}  \usepackage{amsmath}  \usepackage{wasysym}   \usepackage{amsfonts}   \usepackage{amssymb}   \usepackage{amsbsy}  \usepackage{upgreek}  \usepackage{mathrsfs}  \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}  \begin{document}  }{}\begin{equation*} PPV = \frac{{\# \;of\;high\;v^\prime s\;correctly\;predicted}}{{total\;\# \;of\;predicted\;high\;v^\prime s}} \end{equation*}\end{document}\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}  \usepackage{amsmath}  \usepackage{wasysym}   \usepackage{amsfonts}   \usepackage{amssymb}   \usepackage{amsbsy}  \usepackage{upgreek}  \usepackage{mathrsfs}  \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}  \begin{document}  }{}\begin{equation*}FNR = \frac{{\# \ of\ low\ v^\prime s\ incorrectly\ predicted}}{{total\ \# \ of\ predicted\ low\ v^\prime s}}\end{equation*}\end{document}  Evaluation of prediction of sRNA–mRNA Binding Regions  Approximately 150 potential binding regions within Zms4 and Zms6 (sRNAs recently discovered in Z. mobilis (44) but not fully characterized) were randomly generated following the process described in ‘Selection of target regions for evaluation of model prediction ability’. Hybridization efficacy of each region was predicted using the inTherAcc model. Ten total regions were selected for further target prediction analysis for each sRNA: 5 regions that exhibited the highest and 5 regions that exhibited the lowest predicted hybridization efficacy. During the selection process, regions with any overlap to a prior selected region were not considered in an attempt to select for unique regions. The reverse complement of the selected regions was inputted to nucleotide BLAST (20) to identify potential target mRNAs of these two sRNAs in Zymomonas mobilis subsp. mobilis ZM4 (taxid:264203). For selected regions encompassing less than or equal to 10 or 12 nucleotides, 2 or 1 nucleotides of the neighboring sRNA sequence were added onto both ends, respectively, to increase sequence specificity of the hits obtained by BLAST. Five potential targeting arrangements were chosen for each region from BLAST results with the constraints: (i) Minimization of E-value, (ii) Correct orientation of gene sequence, and (iii) Location of sequence at most 400 nucleotides upstream of a TSS or 200 nucleotides downstream of a TTS. For each target region designed for experimental target validation (above), hybridization efficacies as predicted by benchmark software IntaRNA were also estimated (28). First, the hybridization energy of regions within each sRNA with target mRNAs was calculated using the pre-set seed, folding and output parameters with inputs of sRNA sequence and Z. mobilis genome, target NCBI reference sequence NC_006526, within both −300 to +300 nucleotides around the start codon and stop codon, the maximum consideration window offered by the IntaRNA software. Results from both start and stop codon were consolidated within each sRNA and ranked according to energy values. An equal number of target genes to those of inTherAcc, harboring the lowest energy of interaction with the sRNA were ultimately chosen as IntaRNA predictions for Zms4 and Zms6.  RIP-seq of sRNAs Zms4 and Zms6 to identify physically associated mRNA targets  Z. mobilis 8b strain (65) was cultured in RMG media (Glucose, 20.0 g/l; Yeast Extract, 10.0 g/l; KH2PO4, 2.0 g/l; pH 6.0) at 33°C. Strains containing 2MS2-Zms4/Zms6/control plasmids were cultured in 5 ml RMG overnight with 350 μg/ml of kanamycin then transferred into 50 ml RMG to initial OD600nm of 0.1. Cells were grown anaerobically at 33°C for 12 h then pelleted by centrifugation.  Total RNA of 2MS2-Zms4/2MS2-Zms6/2MS2-control strains was prepared according to previously published methods (66). The RNA was incubated with isopropanol and GlycoBlue™ (ThermoScientific) at −20°C overnight. After centrifugation, pelleted RNA was washed with 95% cold ethanol and centrifuged. RNA was resuspended in 50 μl RNase-free water (Ambion) and stored at −80°C for sequencing.  For use as an affinity tag, MS2 coat protein fused with maltose binding protein (MS2-MBP) (67) was expressed in and harvested from E. coli.  Two micrograms of purified MS2-MBP protein was incubated with 100 μl of total RNA (500 ng/μl) extracted from the cells containing 2MS2BD-Zms4/Zms6/control for 1 h at 4°C. Washed amylose beads were incubated with 2MS2BD-Zms4/Zms6/control+MS2-MBP complex for 2 h at 4°C. Supernatants were removed from the beads by applying a magnet. Beads were washed three times with wash buffer and incubated with 50 μl of elution buffer for 15 min. The elution step was repeated so that total 100 μl were collected for each sample. For RNA precipitation, equal volume of isopropanol and 10 μl of GlycoBlue™ was added to elution sample and incubated overnight at −20°C. RNA was pelleted at 15 000 rpm for 15 min at 4°C and washed with 1 ml ethanol. The air-dried RNA pellet was resuspended in 50 μl RNase-free water, quantified and checked for quality using a Bioanalyzer before sequencing. NEBNext® Multiplex RNA Library Prep Set for Illumina® (New England Biolabs Inc.) was used for generating RNA libraries. Sequencing was performed using Illumina® NextSeq technology with paired-end 2 × 150 nt run (Genomic Sequencing and Analysis Facility at the University of Texas at Austin). All sequenced libraries were mapped to the Z. mobilis 8b complete genome (pending publication) using BWA (0.7.12-r1039) (68). DESeq2 (69) was used to identify transcripts enriched in 2MS2-Zms4 and 2MS2-Zms6 samples compared to the 2MS2 only control.

To quantitatively estimate asRNA hybridization efficacy, we assume that it is directly proportional to the ratio of the concentration of asRNA-target RNA in the bound state (B) over the concentration of the asRNA in the unbound state (U). Starting with the standard equation for the equilibrium constant for asRNA-target RNA binding:  (2)\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}  \usepackage{amsmath}  \usepackage{wasysym}   \usepackage{amsfonts}   \usepackage{amssymb}   \usepackage{amsbsy}  \usepackage{upgreek}  \usepackage{mathrsfs}  \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}  \begin{document}  }{}\begin{equation*}v = \log \frac{{[B]}}{{[U]}} = \log ({K_{{\rm eq}}}) = - \beta \Delta {G_{{\rm overall}}}\end{equation*}\end{document}  Here, \documentclass[12pt]{minimal}  \usepackage{amsmath}  \usepackage{wasysym}   \usepackage{amsfonts}   \usepackage{amssymb}   \usepackage{amsbsy}  \usepackage{upgreek}  \usepackage{mathrsfs}  \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}  \begin{document}  }{}$\ v$\end{document}, termed hybridization efficacy, provides a measure of the asRNA-target RNA hybridization. This parameter is estimated experimentally using the logarithm of the ratio of the fluorescence measurements representative of the asRNA-target interaction to the fluorescence background levels [(FLon − FLoff)/FLoff] obtained from the iRS3 reporter (see Materials and Methods for more details). Briefly, this reporter system is composed of an asRNA that targets a specific region within the target RNA and a cis-blocking element (CB) that sequesters a RBS and controls the expression of a downstream green fluorescent protein. Therefore, fluorescence is observed upon asRNA-target RNA hybridization (FLon) as the CB-RBS interaction is disrupted and green fluorescent protein is expressed due to interaction of the asRNA with the target RNA region (Figure 1). FLoff is the fluorescence measured in the absence of the target RNA.(3)\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}  \usepackage{amsmath}  \usepackage{wasysym}   \usepackage{amsfonts}   \usepackage{amssymb}   \usepackage{amsbsy}  \usepackage{upgreek}  \usepackage{mathrsfs}  \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}  \begin{document}  }{}\begin{equation*}v = log\left( {\frac{{F{L_{{\rm on}}} - F{L_{{\rm off}}}}}{{F{L_{{\rm off}}}}}} \right) = log\left( {\frac{{F{L_{{\rm on}}}}}{{F{L_{{\rm off}}}}} - 1} \right)\end{equation*}\end{document}  The model for accessibility-based \documentclass[12pt]{minimal}  \usepackage{amsmath}  \usepackage{wasysym}   \usepackage{amsfonts}   \usepackage{amssymb}   \usepackage{amsbsy}  \usepackage{upgreek}  \usepackage{mathrsfs}  \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}  \begin{document}  }{}$\Delta {G_{{\rm overall}}}$\end{document} depicted in Figure 1 is comprised of the changes in free energy due to asRNA-target binding \documentclass[12pt]{minimal}  \usepackage{amsmath}  \usepackage{wasysym}   \usepackage{amsfonts}   \usepackage{amssymb}   \usepackage{amsbsy}  \usepackage{upgreek}  \usepackage{mathrsfs}  \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}  \begin{document}  }{}$(\Delta {G_{{\rm asT}}})$\end{document}, target region unfolding \documentclass[12pt]{minimal}  \usepackage{amsmath}  \usepackage{wasysym}   \usepackage{amsfonts}   \usepackage{amssymb}   \usepackage{amsbsy}  \usepackage{upgreek}  \usepackage{mathrsfs}  \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}  \begin{document}  }{}$(\Delta {G_{{\rm Tf}}})$\end{document} and folding of the asRNA \documentclass[12pt]{minimal}  \usepackage{amsmath}  \usepackage{wasysym}   \usepackage{amsfonts}   \usepackage{amssymb}   \usepackage{amsbsy}  \usepackage{upgreek}  \usepackage{mathrsfs}  \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}  \begin{document}  }{}$(\Delta {G_{{\rm asf}}})$\end{document}.

It is worth noting that similar thermodynamic derivations have been previously used to describe accessibility-based antisense hybridization (26,28). Other approaches (i.e. AccessFold, RNAplex) have also considered an additional term for an energy penalty due to availability, which influences the transition state energy barrier (initiation energy) that the system is required to overcome to produce the bound complex (24,27). The novelty of this work lies in our two-sided treatment of target accessibility, which is incorporated in a modified free energy of target folding \documentclass[12pt]{minimal}  \usepackage{amsmath}  \usepackage{wasysym}   \usepackage{amsfonts}   \usepackage{amssymb}   \usepackage{amsbsy}  \usepackage{upgreek}  \usepackage{mathrsfs}  \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}  \begin{document}  }{}$(\Delta {G_{{\rm Tf}^\prime}})$\end{document}. We consider target accessibility a combination of the energy penalty for the local disruption of the target region using only the minimum free energy structure \documentclass[12pt]{minimal}  \usepackage{amsmath}  \usepackage{wasysym}   \usepackage{amsfonts}   \usepackage{amssymb}   \usepackage{amsbsy}  \usepackage{upgreek}  \usepackage{mathrsfs}  \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}  \begin{document}  }{}$(\Delta {G_{{\rm Tf}}})$\end{document} as well as the regional availability factor (\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}  \usepackage{amsmath}  \usepackage{wasysym}   \usepackage{amsfonts}   \usepackage{amssymb}   \usepackage{amsbsy}  \usepackage{upgreek}  \usepackage{mathrsfs}  \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}  \begin{document}  }{}$\bar{\theta }$\end{document}), interpreted as a variable entropic contribution (unaccounted for in the nearest neighbor model) that depends on the specific structural context of the targeted region:  (5)\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}  \usepackage{amsmath}  \usepackage{wasysym}   \usepackage{amsfonts}   \usepackage{amssymb}   \usepackage{amsbsy}  \usepackage{upgreek}  \usepackage{mathrsfs}  \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}  \begin{document}  }{}\begin{equation*}\Delta {G_{{\rm Tf}^\prime}} = \Delta {G_{{\rm Tf}}} + \propto \bar{\theta }\end{equation*}\end{document}  In the nearest neighbor model, parameter values were obtained from short (4–10 basepairs), unstructured RNA oligomers, where the entire RNA was involved in the duplex formation. In this case, configurational entropy contributions are absent as there is no change in any structural flexibility or configurational degrees of freedom outside of the region forming the duplex. However, in the case of unfolding larger and more structured RNAs such as the gI intron, changes in target RNA folding outside of the targeted region can have a significant positive effect on the overall flexibility and configurational entropy of the target RNA. This configurational entropy can reduce the free energy penalty of target unfolding to make the overall process more favorable.

Note also that we have assumed temperature-independence of the accessibility factor since all parameters were fitted from data at the same temperature.  One example of the regional availability factor concept is shown in Figure 2. In this example, the unbinding of the colored target region from the P3 helix allows the entire domain of P7-P3–P8 helices significantly greater flexibility (Figure 2B) beyond what may be accounted for in the target region and its complement alone (Figure 2A). Here, we propose that the complex changes in RNA folding associated with asRNA-target RNA binding can be approximated by the regional availability factor. In part, the use of a regional availability factor is intended to account for structural fluctuations in dynamic regions that have a differential influence on hybridization efficacy, which we hypothesize can inform targeting by antisense RNAs. Furthermore, we propose that these regions involved in metastable alternative structures are hallmarked by the ensemble of suboptimal structures obtained from RNA folding algorithms such as Nupack (64). Thus, as a starting point before in vivo optimization, we estimate regional availability for a target region as a cohesive unit by summation of each nucleotide's local availability over the length of the target region:  (6)\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}  \usepackage{amsmath}  \usepackage{wasysym}   \usepackage{amsfonts}   \usepackage{amssymb}   \usepackage{amsbsy}  \usepackage{upgreek}  \usepackage{mathrsfs}  \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}  \begin{document}  }{}\begin{equation*}\bar{\theta } = \sum\nolimits_{\rm i}^{\rm j} {{\theta _{\rm k}}} \ \end{equation*}\end{document}  In Equation ((6)), i and j represent the start and end of each region correspondingly and θk is the local availability of nucleotide k. The local availabilities (θk) can be estimated by base-paired probabilities based on the ensemble of suboptimal structures of the target RNA (unlike energy of target unfolding that is based on the minimum free energy structure alone), allowing inclusion of regional equilibrium structural fluctuations that often facilitate intermolecular interactions (70,71). Therefore, our proposed biophysical model, considers the following four predictors:  (7)\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}  \usepackage{amsmath}  \usepackage{wasysym}   \usepackage{amsfonts}   \usepackage{amssymb}   \usepackage{amsbsy}  \usepackage{upgreek}  \usepackage{mathrsfs}  \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}  \begin{document}  }{}\begin{equation*}v \propto \Delta {G_{{\rm asT}}} + \Delta {G_{{\rm Tf}}} + \Delta {G_{{\rm asf}}} + \bar{\theta }\end{equation*}\end{document}  Figure 2.  Proposed regional availability factor in novel biophysical model. The influence of structural availability (as captured by the ensemble of suboptimal structures) on intermolecular interactions can be attributed to variable entropic contributions to asRNA-target binding free energies that depend on structural context of targeted regions. The f →u subscript denotes the change from folded to unfolded states and the apostrophe represents the adjusted free energy accounting for regional availability. The init, AU and NNk subscripts indicate the standard free energy terms associated with initiation, terminal AU pairs and stacking free energies (respectively) in the standard nearest neighbor model. (A) The thermodynamic model from Figure 1 captures the nearest neighbor free energy of unfolding the target region based on the minimum free energy (MFE) structure. (B) The proposed regional availability factor (estimated as the sum of one minus the base pairing probabilities in the target region calculated from the ensemble of suboptimal structures in Nupack (64)) captures entropic effects of target RNA distal structural variations that occur upon target unfolding. As an example, there is a potential for a significant portion of the gI intron (regions P7, P3, P8) to have increased vibrational and translational degrees of freedom upon breaking of the long-range tertiary base pairs in the highlighted target region of the P3 helix, an effect which is captured by this example suboptimal structure. Furthermore, with the use of in vivo optimization, the effects of entropy contributions from interactions with unknown cellular factors in these dynamic regions may also be captured by the ensemble of suboptimal structures from Nupack.  Model optimization using in vivo experimental profiling of asRNA hybridization efficacy  While there is novelty in considering ensemble base-pairing probabilities as a regional availability factor, the most notable aspect of this study lies in the in vivo optimization of the above models using experimental hybridization data for a diversity of RNA targets. Conceivably, one of the greatest challenges in prediction of hybridization efficacy is the ability to account for asRNA-target interactions in vivo, where interactions with other molecules are prevalent due to molecular crowding and complex patterns of ionic strength that vary across different organisms (39). Additionally, the entropy changes of binding may vary also with the cellular environment since unanticipated intermolecular interactions (often involving these metastable structural regions) can have significant effects on system entropy. We therefore hypothesize that the proposed models can be experimentally optimized in vivo to capture regional fluctuations and cellular effects to improve estimation of asRNA hybridization efficiency. To this end, our baseline thermodynamic (Equation (4)) and proposed biophysical (Equation 7) models were optimized by taking into account in vivo hybridization patterns collected directly within cells.  For this work, we have collected large sets of antisense hybridization data using a recently published fluorescence-based assay (iRS3) for in vivo RNA profiling (43). Specifically, we interrogated 80 regions within three diverse target RNAs: the gI intron (393 nt, in which 35 regions were probed), the csrB regulator (369 nt, in which 27 regions were probed), and the glutamate tRNA (76 nt, in which 18 regions were probed). Figure 3 illustrates all the collected hybridization profiles for these three target molecules, where the heat maps depict differential levels of asRNA-target binding. A list of all 80 asRNAs designed for these molecules is included in Supplementary Table S2. These molecules make appropriate targets for this study given their complex structural features that challenge the ability to predict hybridization. For instance, in the gI intron, secondary structure domains that are essential for catalysis such as P4–P6 and P3–P9 (Figure 3A) (72,73) contain tertiary contacts (gray boxes in 3A) that are connected to each other via pseudoknots (covered by regions 8–10) (74). Predicting hybridization efficacy in pseudoknot domains is extremely challenging and most current secondary structure prediction approaches fail to predict these complex structures. In addition, these interactions are capable of disrupting the folding pathway, e.g. from misfolded to the native state, generating low abundance intermediates in which certain regions are rendered single-stranded (52,75–76). As discussed in a previous work (43), our experimental probing system bears the potential to sense transient states present in vivo, which is consistent with the relatively high hybridization efficacy of regions 8–10. In the case of CsrB, six of the regions with the lowest hybridization efficacies (regions 5, 7, 10, 11, 20 and 22 in Figure 3B) contain the binding recognition motif (GGA) for its major target, the CsrA protein (77,78,79); specifically the GGA motif in the stem loop of region 22, has been recently suggested as a strong binding site (80). Our ability to see these patterns reflected in the level of hybridization potential of these regions indicates that our data set captures the effect of in vivo interactions with other cellular factors. Lastly, our in vivo experimental data also captures expected high hybridization efficacy within the tRNA at the highly flexible anticodon arm (corresponding to region 8 in Figure 3C), consistent with molecular dynamic simulations and crystallographic B-factors for various tRNA models (81). Collectively, these observations validate the experimental data collected and used for model optimization.  Figure 3.  asRNA hybridization map as measured by in vivo oligonucleotide hybridization.

All parameters resulting from this optimization are included in Supplementary Table S3. As shown in Figure 4, we observe that the regional availability factor (\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}  \usepackage{amsmath}  \usepackage{wasysym}   \usepackage{amsfonts}   \usepackage{amssymb}   \usepackage{amsbsy}  \usepackage{upgreek}  \usepackage{mathrsfs}  \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}  \begin{document}  }{}$\boldsymbol{\bar{\theta }}$\end{document}) by itself and in relation with the energy of target unfolding \documentclass[12pt]{minimal}  \usepackage{amsmath}  \usepackage{wasysym}   \usepackage{amsfonts}   \usepackage{amssymb}   \usepackage{amsbsy}  \usepackage{upgreek}  \usepackage{mathrsfs}  \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}  \begin{document}  }{}$(\Delta {G_{{\rm Tf}}})$\end{document} is prominent in its influence as a predictor of hybridization efficacy. This observation underscores the importance of the differential relationship between the two target accessibility measures. Interestingly, this statistically-derived mathematical form marginally resembles the scaling of the stacking energies by base-pairing probabilities used by Sfold in siRNA design (36). Importantly, the optimization of the baseline thermodynamic (Equation (4)) and biophysical (Equation 7) models led to the development of the inTher (in vivo optimized Thermodynamic), Equation ((8)) and in vivo optimized Thermodynamic Accessibility-adjusted (inTherAcc), Equation ((9)) models, respectively.(8)\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}  \usepackage{amsmath}  \usepackage{wasysym}   \usepackage{amsfonts}   \usepackage{amssymb}   \usepackage{amsbsy}  \usepackage{upgreek}  \usepackage{mathrsfs}  \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}  \begin{document}  }{}\begin{equation*}v \propto \Delta {G_{{\rm Tf}}}(\Delta {G_{{\rm asT}}}) + \Delta {G_{{\rm asT}}} + \Delta {G_{{\rm Tf}}}\end{equation*}\end{document}(9)\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}  \usepackage{amsmath}  \usepackage{wasysym}   \usepackage{amsfonts}   \usepackage{amssymb}   \usepackage{amsbsy}  \usepackage{upgreek}  \usepackage{mathrsfs}  \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}  \begin{document}  }{}\begin{equation*}v \propto \bar{\theta }(\Delta {G_{{\rm Tf}}}) + \Delta {G_{{\rm Tf}}}(\Delta {G_{{\rm asT}}}) + \Delta {G_{{\rm asT}}} + \Delta {G_{{\rm Tf}}} + \bar{\theta }\end{equation*}\end{document}  Figure 4.  Relative significance of each term in the (A) inTherAcc and (B) inTher models. Optimization of baseline thermodynamic (Equation (4)) and biophysical models (Equation (7)) with in vivo data produces significant models (P-values < 1E-4 and 1E-10, respectively). The addition of the availability term (\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}  \usepackage{amsmath}  \usepackage{wasysym}   \usepackage{amsfonts}   \usepackage{amssymb}   \usepackage{amsbsy}  \usepackage{upgreek}  \usepackage{mathrsfs}  \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}  \begin{document}  }{}${\rm{\bar{\theta }}}$\end{document}) and its statistically significant interaction with the unfolding energy of the target region (ΔGtf) to the inTherAcc model increases the significance of common parameters seen in (B).  Importantly, as presented in Figure 5, regression analyses of the ability of these models to capture in vivo hybridization data shows that the proposed optimized versions of both, thermodynamic and biophysical models (in Equations (8) and 9, Figure 5A and B, respectively) exhibits improved performance relative to the non-optimized models (Equations (4) and (7), Figure 5C and D). Furthermore, the use of the regional availability factor in the inTherAcc model (Equation (9), Figure 5B) shows an additional enhancement relative to its counterpart inTher in its ability to capture in vivo asRNA hybridization data, making it the best model developed in this work. These findings set the grounds for a final test case in which inTherAcc predictions of highly ‘hybridizable’ regions in four structurally diverse RNAs were experimentally validated. Collectively, these results suggest that consideration of physical intracellular interactions (as captured by the collected data) is vital to improve the accuracy of hybridization behavior predictions.  Figure 5.  Improvement in performance for in vivo optimized models underscores the influence of intracellular factors. Comparing linear correlations of (A) the in vivo optimized Thermodynamic model (Equation (8)), (B) the in vivo optimized Thermodynamic Accessibility-adjusted model (Equation 9), (C) the un-optimized thermodynamics-only method (Equation (4)) and (D) the un-optimized biophysical model (Equation (7)) shows the ability of the inTher model family to capture the in vivo collected data. This improved performance can be attributed to the incorporation of statistical interactions between prediction parameters that likely well-represent the cellular environment.  The inTherAcc model proves effective in predicting extreme asRNA hybridization regions in other RNA targets  Initial evaluation of the predictive capabilities of the inTherAcc model was performed by a 3-fold cross validation analysis using the same in vivo data set used for optimization. Our evaluation shows that the cross-validated R2 is 0.37 and 0.09 for inTherAcc and inTher models, respectively, confirming the increased predictive potential of the inTherAcc model. Given these results, we further tested the prediction capabilities of the inTherAcc model using four additional unique RNA targets: the 2-MS2 RNA tag (2-MS2), the model RNA LtrB group II intron (gII), the Spinach II RNA (SpnII) in a tRNA scaffold (82) and the glgC mRNA 5΄UTR (glgC).  To interrogate highly ‘hybridizable’ regions within these RNA molecules, 1300 target regions across the entirety of these four molecules were randomly compiled. The regions were randomly varied in length between 9–17 nucleotides (see Materials and Methods section). The hybridization efficacies of these regions were calculated using the inTherAcc model. Following predictions with the inTherAcc model, 49 regions were selected for experimental validation; 6 regions for the 2-MS2, 13 regions for Spinach, 13 regions for glgC and 17 regions for the larger gII were experimentally tested. In general, regions representing a wide range of predicted hybridization efficacy were selected, with a particular interest in those with highest ranked predicted efficacy (Figure 6A). The heat maps illustrated in Figure 6A depict relative levels of asRNA hybridization efficacy that were detected for each target molecule using the iRS3 high throughput plasmid (iRS3-GG) (see Supplementary Figure S1A) as described in the Materials and Methods section. It is worth noting that two of the top predicted regions (regions 2 and 17) for asRNA hybridization efficacy in the gII intron correspond to well-studied regions that contain one and two tertiary structure contacts, respectively (83). These contacts are known to be involved in long-range interactions (generally weaker than secondary structure interactions). In the case of the regions with the highest hybridization efficacy for 2-MS2, regions 5 and 6 both overlap with a 2-MS2 coat protein binding site (84) located in a loop. Likewise, it is noteworthy that region 2 within the GlgC 5΄UTR, targeting its preferred CsrA interacting site (85), appears to be one of the regions with the lowest hybridization efficacies. On the other hand, regions 6 and 7 in the glgC 5΄UTR overlap with the relatively more single-stranded (86,87) SD and start codon regions, respectively, and show one of the highest hybridization efficacies. Lastly, in the Spinach molecule, region 4 covers the binding site for DFHBI (88,89), the target molecule of this aptamer. Overall, these observations indicated that our predictions of extreme hybridization potential captured important structural-functional features of these molecules.  Figure 6.  Experimental evaluation of hybridization efficacy in four RNAs shows inTherAcc model prediction accuracy comparable to that of benchmark IntaRNA. (A) Relative hybridization efficacy of each tested region is indicated on the predicted secondary structure (64) of respective molecules via color-coded lines, in which green and red represent highest and lowest hybridization efficacy, respectively, per scale bar (bottom). Each nucleotide is colored based on equilibrium probability (bar on the right) according to Nupack (64) output. Regions which were correctly predicted by inTherAcc to be high or low are denoted by an asterisk. (B) Comparison of positive Predictive Value-PPV (top) for high hybridization efficacies and False Negative Ratio-FNR (bottom) for low hybridization efficacies, for inTher (red), inTherAcc (blue) and IntaRNA (green).  Importantly, when calculating the PPV of regions with high hybridization efficacy and the FNR of regions with low hybridization efficacy for all the data collected, inTherAcc (but not inTher) performed overall comparably to IntaRNA predictions in terms of PPV and FNR. We chose to benchmark against IntaRNA since it is an accessibility-based approach, uses a seed interaction that resembles our regional interaction notion and has been tested for bacterial systems (28). However, inTherAcc displays improved prediction performance, relative to IntaRNA, particularly for the gII intron (R2 = 0.13 versus 0.08) and 2-MS2 (R2 = 0.949 versus 0.014) as shown in Figure 7. No difference in performance was observed when considering the linear correlations for glgC and SpinachII RNAs (R2 < 5% for all three models). In summary, these findings support the potential prospects of considering both, IntaRNA and inTherAcc, complementary approaches in the prediction of hybridization efficacy (see Supplementary Figure S7 for a summary of all the prediction versus experimental results).  Figure 7.  Regression analysis on experimental versus inTherAcc-(top), inTher-(center) and IntaRNA-(bottom) predicted hybridization efficacy for (A) 2-MS2 and (B) gII intron. inTherAcc exhibits superior performance in predicting hybridization potential in (A) 2-MS2 and (B) group II intron compared to both inTher and IntaRNA models when considering linear regression fits. (B) Higher performance accuracy of hybridization efficacy in gII intron is achieved by inTherAcc due to its capability to predict extreme lows and highs. Error bars indicate standard error of the mean. Both predicted and experimental hybridization efficacies were linearly scaled from 0 to 1.  inTherAcc aids in prediction of target mRNAs  As a final model validation, we evaluated the ability of inTherAcc to aid in prediction of target mRNAs of newly-identified sRNAs in a different bacterium. We selected two sRNAs responsive in expression level to ethanol stress, Zms4 (280 nt) and Zms6 (304 nt) of Z. mobilis (44). A RIP-seq experiment was performed by tagging each sRNA with 2-MS2 RNA. Following purification of the sRNAs with the MS2-binding protein and sequencing the physically associated RNAs, the most likely targets were identified as those that showed the greatest transcript enrichment compared to a control (2-MS2 with no sRNA attached). Because of the response of Zms4 and Zms6 to ethanol stress, we expect their mRNA targets to include stress-related genes. Indeed, as expected, many potential targets discovered by RIP-seq for both Zms4 and Zms6 (Supplementary Table S4) were related to stress responses, including global stress response regulators, heat shock proteins, protein folding chaperones and DNA repair proteins. Because the inTherAcc model is well-suited to help narrow the large pool of potential targets by predicting those with most favorable hybridization efficacies, potential regions of interest in both sRNAs were randomly compiled and ranked by hybridization efficacies using our inTherAcc model (Figure 8A), as described in the Materials and Methods section. As observed in Figure 8A, interesting ‘hot spots,’ defined as regions exhibiting predicted extreme (high or low) hybridization efficacies were identified and considered for further analysis. The rationale behind using regions with predicted high and low hybridization efficacies is based on the hypothesis that these regions are likely to be functional sites either highly available or unavailable based on active binding to in vivo factors. The reverse complement sequences of the five highest and five lowest predicted hybridization efficacies were selected for BLAST analysis to identify potential ‘top’ likely interacting mRNA targets (for a total of 52–54 unique genes considered). Comparisons of these results with data obtained from RIP-seq experiments supported the target prediction capability of the inTherAcc model. As shown in Figure 8B, inTherAcc predicted about 28 and 22 potential targets, respectively for Zms4 and Zms6, found in the set of RIP-seq-determined enriched transcripts. Importantly, about 8 and 7 potential targets respectively for Zms4 and Zms6 were found within the top approximately 20% pulled-down targets (ranked by fold change enrichment relative to the 2-MS2-only control). In all cases for each region predicted to be an mRNA binding site, multiple potential targets were found suggesting the ability of these sRNAs to exert multiplex regulation (Supplementary Table S4). As expected, a considerable portion of enriched transcript associations of Zms4 and Zms6 correctly predicted by inTherAcc code for proteins involved in ethanol tolerance mechanisms, specifically those that facilitate (i) protein folding and transport, (ii) redox metabolism and (iii) stress response (90,91), further validating our results. In addition, inTherAcc showed a comparable performance to benchmark IntaRNA (Supplementary Table S4 and Figure 8B). The limited number of matches in target prediction (Figure 8B) between both approaches underscores the potential complementarity between them. Collectively, these results show the potential of the model to aid in gene target prediction and, more specifically, to identify potential functional regions that act via base-pairing.  Figure 8.  inTherAcc aids in prediction of mRNA targets for Z. mobilis (A) Zms4 and (B) Zms6. Ten regions evenly distributed at the top (green) and bottom (red) of the hybridization efficacy scale were selected as potential mRNA–sRNA binding sites for further prediction of target mRNA candidates and comparison with RIP-seq data. The regions that matched with the 18% of top enriched candidates (log2 of fold change sRNA/only MS2) are marked with blue arrows. (C) Overview of the prediction performance for IntaRNA (green) and inTherAcc (blue). Venn diagram showing the total enriched candidates (log2(sRNA/only MS2) > 0). A total of 52 and 54 candidates respectively for Zms4 and Zms6 were predicted using both approaches. Darker green and darker blue circles represent the top 18% enriched candidates that each approach predicted correctly.  Figure 1.  Proposed accessibility-based mechanism of antisense hybridization in living cells. (A) Example target region with color-coded local availability (estimated by base-pairing probabilities) is shown in canonical conformation, as would be expected in the native state. In antisense RNAs (asRNA) targeting by the iRS3, the targeted region must unbind from P3 to become single stranded as shown in (B) with a free energy change of –ΔGTf. The iRS3 consists of four main elements: a cis-blocking strand (CB, orange), a ribosome binding site (RBS, blue), the sequence encoding green fluorescence protein (GFP, green) and the probe (pink and black) of 8–27 nucleotides targeting a specific region shown in (B). The expected native state of the iRS3 is shown in (C), and it must also unfold to bind the target region as shown in (D) with a free energy change of –ΔGasf. Finally, the two unfolded structures bind as in (E) with a free energy change of ΔGasT to stabilize the unfolded iRS3 and allow translation of GFP. Effective asRNA targeting results in a high fluorescence response.  ",FALSE,TRUE,

PMC5489566,Abstract,Abstract,CR377818,0,0,0,,,"  Vibrionaceae is a large marine bacterial family, which can constitute up to 50% of the prokaryotic population in marine waters. Photobacterium is the second largest genus in the family and we used comparative genomics on 35 strains representing 16 of the 28 species described so far, to understand the genomic diversity present in the Photobacterium genus. Such understanding is important for ecophysiology studies of the genus. We used whole genome sequences to evaluate phylogenetic relationships using several analyses (16S rRNA, MLSA, fur, amino-acid usage, ANI), which allowed us to identify two misidentified strains. Genome analyses also revealed occurrence of higher and lower GC content clades, correlating with phylogenetic clusters. Pan- and core-genome analysis revealed the conservation of 25% of the genome throughout the genus, with a large and open pan-genome. The major source of genomic diversity could be traced to the smaller chromosome and plasmids. Several of the physiological traits studied in the genus did not correlate with phylogenetic data. Since horizontal gene transfer (HGT) is often suggested as a source of genetic diversity and a potential driver of genomic evolution in bacterial species, we looked into evidence of such in Photobacterium genomes. Genomic islands were the source of genomic differences between strains of the same species. Also, we found transposase genes and CRISPR arrays that suggest multiple encounters with foreign DNA. Presence of genomic exchange traits was widespread and abundant in the genus, suggesting a role in genomic evolution. The high genetic variability and indications of genetic exchange make it difficult to elucidate genome evolutionary paths and raise the awareness of the roles of foreign DNA in the genomic evolution of environmental organisms.

We found a high genomic diversity within this genus, and some genomic traits appear to be related to lifestyle, such as GC content, genome size, bioluminescence, secondary metabolism and virulence. We evaluated genomic traits related to genomic exchange such as prophage infection, presence of genomic islands and genes coding for transposases and show that these are abundant in the Photobacterium genus, indicating numerous genomic changes throughout evolution of the genus. Genomic exchange might therefore be the strongest driver in the genomic evolution of this genus, reflected in the different lifestyles of the species.  ",FALSE,TRUE,

PMC5489566,Introduction,Introduction,CR377818,0,0,0,,,"  Introduction  Oceans cover 70% of Planet Earth and it has been estimated to harbor an extensive unexplored genomic potential (Sunagawa et al., 2015). The rapid development in sequencing technologies and the focus on improved cultivation of hitherto uncultured microorganisms has dramatically increased our understanding of both diversity and biotechnological potential found in the marine habitats (Zengler et al., 2002; Lasken, 2012; Mardis, 2013; Choi et al., 2015; Loman and Pallen, 2015; Sunagawa et al., 2015). Vibrionaceae is a prominent marine bacterial family and it represents 0.8% of the bacterial population as found in the Tara oceans metagenomic data (Sunagawa et al., 2015). Based on molecular assessment, it can constitute up to 50% of the prokaryotic population in marine waters (Wietz et al., 2010a; Gilbert et al., 2012). Vibrio is the largest genus within this family (73% in Tara oceans data) and it has been extensively studied, in part due to the importance of the human pathogen V. cholerae (Meibom et al., 2004; Stauder et al., 2012; Kim et al., 2015; Papenfort et al., 2015; Rajpara et al., 2015). The genus Photobacterium (16%) is the second largest genus of the family, followed by Aliivibrio (3%).  Species belonging to the Vibrionaceae family are believed to be very similar (Vitulo et al., 2007). However, most studies have been based on Vibrio species, and only a few have included Photobacterium strains. Recent metagenomic data shows that although these two genera seem to have similar ecological strategies, Photobacterium spp. dominates in the lower pelagic depths (surface water layer and deep chlorophyll maximum layer) while Vibrio spp. is more prevalent in higher depths (mesopelagic zone) (Figure 1; Sunagawa et al., 2015). This suggests different ecological strategies and roles of the two genera.  Figure 1  Taxonomic composition of the Vibrionaceae family at different pelagic depths. The data was retrieved from the Tara oceans project, and included stations where information was acquired for the three depths (Sunagawa et al., 2015). The rings represent the different depths: surface water layer—down to 5 m depth (outer ring); deep chlorophyll maximum layer—from 5 to 200 m depth (middle ring); and mesopelagic zone—from 250 to 1,000 m depth (inner ring).  Photobacterium includes species with different life-styles: free-living, symbiotic or pathogenic (Urbanczyk et al., 2011). The genus currently covers 28 species of which 26 have validly published names (www.bacterio.net) (“P. atrarenae” and “P. marinum” are not yet validly published names) (Gomez-Gil et al., 2011; Kim et al., 2011; Lucena et al., 2011; Urbanczyk et al., 2011; Srinivas et al., 2013; Figge et al., 2014; Liu et al., 2014; Lo et al., 2014; Moreira et al., 2014; Machado et al., 2015a). Of these 28, only 27 are available since no type strain was deposited for P. aplysiae, (Seo et al., 2005; Holmes and Farmer, 2008). Twenty-two of the 28 species have been described during the last 15 years, making it a relatively new genus.  The majority of Photobacterium strains have been isolated from marine environments, although isolation of a P. halotolerans from the rhizosphere of a terrestrial weed has recently been reported (Mathew et al., 2015a,b). All species of this genus were originally thought to be luminescent, but it has become clear that a large number of species are not luminescent (Lucena et al., 2011; Urbanczyk et al., 2011). This ecological important characteristic is part of the symbiotic life style of some Photobacterium species and is attributed to the expression of the lux-rib operon (Dunlap, 2009). This operon has been used taxonomically for the division of the genus into clades (Ast and Dunlap, 2004; Urbanczyk et al., 2011).  Recently, we and other scientists have sequenced the genomes of several strains of this genus, representing a total of 16 different species. Most of the strains have been isolated from the marine environment, although with different approaches and goals (Table S1). Some were isolated as symbionts of marine animals, others from spoiled fish, and others host-associated with oysters, crabs and fish (Ast et al., 2007; Gomez-Gil et al., 2011; Urbanczyk et al., 2011; Bjornsdottir-Butler et al., 2016). Some were isolated as free-living organisms from coastal or pelagic waters (Nogi et al., 1998), and P. galatheae S2753 was isolated due to its antagonism against pathogenic bacteria (Gram et al., 2010; Machado et al., 2015a).  The purpose of the present study was to use this recent genomic information to investigate the genomic diversity within the genus, and analyzed the possible genetic foundation of known physiological traits. These analyses allow a better understanding of the genus phylogeny by elucidating evolutionary relationships using genomic information; it reveals the genomic diversity existent within the genus and the role of foreign DNA in genomic diversity acquisition.

Calculation of basic genome statistics such as size, GC content and amino acid usage was done using the CMG biotools (Vesth et al., 2013). These tools were also used for gene finding using prodigalrunner, generation of BLAST atlases comparing the protein-coding open reading frames and for the pan- and core-genome analyses of the studied strains.  Phylogenetic analyses  The 16S rRNA gene sequences used are the publically available sequences originally published for each strain or obtained from the whole genome sequence when other sequence was not available. The gene sequences used for the MLSA (ftsZ, gapA, gyrB, mreB, pyrH, recA, rpoA) and the fur gene sequence, were obtained from the genomes using the CLC Main Workbench (CLC Aarhus, Denmark version 7) (Table S2). An annotation-based search was performed for the gene sequences of interest using the NCBI annotation. The genomes not annotated at NCBI were annotated using RAST (Aziz et al., 2008; Overbeek et al., 2014). The accession numbers for 16S rRNA gene sequences and the gene locus tags are provided in Table S2. The gene topA was not used in the MLSA, since no homologous sequence was found in the genome of P. galatheae S2753. Alignments and Maximum Likelihood Phylogeny trees were done using CLC Main Workbench. Maximum Likelihood Phylogeny trees were constructed using the Neighbor Joining method with the Jukes-Cantor nucleotide distance measure. The topology of the tree was tested with 1,000 bootstrap replications. MEGA 6 was used to finalize the tree design (Tamura et al., 2013).  The Genome-to-Genome Distance Calculator by DSMZ was used to determine in silico DNA-DNA re-association percent values (Auch et al., 2010), and the Average Nucleotide Identity (ANI) calculator to estimate the ANI values (Goris et al., 2007). The nucleotide identity percentages for the fur gene and the MLSA were calculated using the pair-wise comparison tool of CLC Main Workbench.  lux-rib operon  The lux genes were identified by homology search to previously described genes (Ast and Dunlap, 2004; Urbanczyk et al., 2008, 2012) using protein sequence BLAST tools of CLC Main Workbench with identity/query coverage cutoff of 50/50. Identified lux operons were then blasted against whole genome sequences of the studied Photobacterium strains using MultiGeneBLAST (Medema et al., 2013).  Identification of prophages, genomic islands and secondary metabolite clusters  Prophages, genomic islands and secondary metabolite clusters were identified using the online tools PHAST, IslandViewer 3 and antiSMASH 3.0, respectively (Zhou et al., 2011; Dhillon et al., 2015; Weber et al., 2015). The whole genome sequences were submitted to the different tools, and the identified clusters compared using MultiGeneBLAST (Medema et al., 2013).  CRISPR-cas  Genome sequences were analyzed in CRISPRfinder (Grissa et al., 2007) and homology searches for CRISPR associated genes were performed using CLC Main Workbench. Using the CLC Main Workbench BLAST tool, direct repeats and protospacers were compared among each other and to previously identified prophages. Confirmation of cas genes was performed by BLAST comparison of the identified open-reading frames to the NCBI nucleotide database.  Plasmid comparison and virulence genes  We used previously described Photobacterium plasmids to search the genomes for contigs belonging to plasmids using CLC Main Workbench. Plasmids used in the search included: pPHDD1 (FN597600.2), pAQU1 (AB571865.1), pP99-018 (AB277723.1), pP91278 (AB277724.1), pPHDP60 (KC344732.1), pPHDP10 (DQ069059.1), pPHDP70 (KP100338.1), pP9014 (AB453229.1), pPH1 (AY789019.1), pPBPR1 (CR377818.1), and the unnamed plasmid from P. gaetbulicola Gung47 (KC687076.1).  Identification of virulence, histamine production, and transposase genes  The genes hlyA and dly are key virulence genes of P. damselae (Rivas et al., 2011, 2013; Le Roux et al., 2015). Virulence related genes were identified using the BLAST tools of CLC Main Workbench with protein identity/query coverage cutoff of 50/50. Also the genetic basis for histamine production was evaluated, by searching for genes related to histamine production, previously identified in Photobacterium strains (Bjornsdottir-Butler et al., 2016). An annotation based identification of transposase genes was performed in CLC Main Workbench.  Singleton analysis  The number of singletons per genome was calculated using the EDGAR platform for comparative genomics (Blom et al., 2009). A private project has been created by uploading the whole genome sequences of the studied Photobacterium strains and the analysis performed using default settings for singleton identification.

However, this gene has low discriminatory power in resolving species relatedness; for instance, P. angustum strains appear scattered throughout the phylogenetic tree, and P. damselae subsp. piscicida DI21 and “P. marinum” AK15 cluster closely to V. pacinii DSM18139 (Figure S1).  The limitations of the use of the 16S rRNA gene as a phylogenetic marker in Vibrionaceae have been previously reported (Sawabe et al., 2007; Machado and Gram, 2015), and the use of Multi-Locus Sequence Analysis (MLSA) has been proposed when evaluating Vibrionaceae phylogenetic relationships (Thompson F. L. et al., 2005; Sawabe et al., 2007, 2013; Pascual et al., 2010; Gabriel et al., 2014). Here, we used several clustering methods to investigate the phylogenetic relationships within the Photobacterium genus. Different approaches (MLSA, fur, amino-acid usage, average nucleotide identity [ANI]) led to distinct phylogenetic results; nevertheless the core phylogenetic groups identified were the same (Figure 2, Figures S2, S3).  Figure 2  Phylogenetic trees. The trees were constructed using seven house-keeping genes (ftsZ, gapA, gyrB, mreB, pyrH, recA, rpoA) (A) and the fur gene (B). The topology of the tree was tested with 1,000 bootstrap replications, and Vibrio pacinii DSM 19139 used to root the tree.  In the MLSA, sequences of seven genes (ftsZ, gapA, gyrB, mreB, pyrH, recA, rpoA) allowed a phylogenetic evaluation using a concatenation length of 7,230 bp. Here, strains belonging to the same species cluster tightly. The same was observed for the recently described identification marker, the ferric up-take regulator (fur) gene (Machado and Gram, 2015). The fur gene has been described as a powerful identification marker in the Vibrionaceae family, however the phylogenetic relationships observed were different from the ones obtained using MLSA and whole genome sequence methods (amino-acid usage and ANI) (Figure 2, Figures S2, S3).  The phylogenetic analysis showed a misidentification of two isolates, P. phosphoreum ANT-2200 and P. damselae subsp. damselae ATCC 33539. Based on our results, P. phosphoreum ANT-2200 should be classified as P. kishitanii, as has previously been suggested (Ast and Dunlap, 2004; Urbanczyk et al., 2011; Bjornsdottir-Butler et al., 2016), and was here confirmed by the phylogenetic assessment and the genomic analyses. The genome identified as belonging to P. damselae subsp. damselae ATCC 33539 was similar to the ones of P. angustum, but the 16S rRNA gene phylogeny using the original sequence placed this strain elsewhere. In fact, partial (FJ971859) and complete (NR_040831) 16S rRNA sequences available for strain ATCC 33539 presented 52 and 68% of query coverage, respectively, with 94 and 96% of identity to the whole genome sequence identified as belonging to P. damselae subsp. damselae ATCC33539. Since no other physiological discrepancies have been previously reported, we believe that the case of P. damselae subsp. damselae ATCC 33539 might be a wrong whole genome sequence submission to NCBI or sequencing of a wrong strain.  This study did not clarify the phylogenetic association of P. damselae as MLSA, fur, ANI, amino-acid usage analyses placed it in different branches, confirming its unstable association (Lucena et al., 2011). In contrast, although the species “P. marinum” has not been recognized, we here show that the type-strain AK15 seems to be indeed the representative of a new species (Srinivas et al., 2013).  In order to provide a quantitative evaluation of the different phylogenetic approaches, in silico DNA-DNA hybridization, fur and MLSA percentage of identity values were calculated and correlated to the ANI. Comparing all the tested phylogenetic methods, resulted in correlation coefficients between 0.84 and 0.95 (Figure S4). Interestingly, the fur gene of approximately 450 bp correlated better with the ANI than the MLSA, which used approximately 6,800 bp more in the analysis. This strengthens the previous suggestion of the use of the fur gene in the classification of Vibrionaceae family strains (Machado and Gram, 2015). We therefore suggest the use of fur analysis in the future classification of new Photobacterium isolates, although MLSA should still be used to evaluate evolutionary relationships.  The division of the Photobacterium genus into two or three clades has been previously suggested (Lucena et al., 2011; Urbanczyk et al., 2011). The most recent review on this genus proposed two clades, based both on the molecular phylogenetic evaluation, but also on the creation of a luminous/symbiotic and a non-luminous/non-symbiotic clusters (Urbanczyk et al., 2011). Our results support the phylogenetic relationship previously observed between the species of each cluster, but the identification of genes responsible for luminescence suggest that P. angustum and P. damselae are not luminescent species as reported before (Urbanczyk et al., 2011; Figure S5). Some strains of P. damselae have acquired lux genes through horizontal gene transfer (HGT) (Urbanczyk et al., 2008), which might explain the absence of these genes in the studied strains. On the other hand, luminescence of P. angustum strains varies (Urbanczyk et al., 2011), but we could not identify lux genes in any of the six P. angustum strains. Furthermore, P. ganghwense has been defined as bioluminescent (Park et al., 2006); however, it has not been described how this feature was evaluated in the original study, nor could we identify lux genes in the genome of the type-strain. Therefore, the generic division of luminous vs. non-luminous clades should be avoided.  Genomic diversity  General genomic features  The Photobacterium genomes ranged in size from 4.2 to 6.4 Mb (Figure 3). The genome size range was in accordance with the ones reported for other genera from the Vibrionaceae family (Thompson et al., 2009). The largest genomes found belonged to P. profundum, which is an extremely versatile species. P. profundum SS9 is able to grow at cold temperatures and in pressurized environments (Eloe et al., 2008; Lauro et al., 2008, 2014). It seems therefore logical that such environmental versatility comes associated with a larger genome size (Konstantinidis and Tiedje, 2004).  Figure 3  Genome size and GC content of the studied genomes. The size is represented in mega-bases (Mb) by the horizontal bars and the percentage of GC by the black dots.  The GC content of the genomes varied between 38.7 and 50.9%, and the strains clustered in two groups based on GC%: one of approximately 40% and another of approximately 50%. The only exceptions were P. swingsii CAIM1393 and Photobacterium sp. AK15, which had a GC content of 43.4 and 46.2%, respectively. The GC content has been linked to a division of strains that also is reflected in their environmental conditions as well as to amino acid usage (Lightfield et al., 2011). Independently of the method used, the species with higher GC content clustered together, suggesting an evolutionary association of GC content and phylogenetic proximity within the genus (Figure 2).  Several theories for genome evolution in bacteria explaining smaller cell size and genomes, the different GC content, the genomic reductions and expansions have been presented and discussed (Moran et al., 2007; Hunt et al., 2008a; Newton et al., 2010; Morris et al., 2012; Fernández-Gómez et al., 2013; Giovannoni et al., 2014; Luo and Moran, 2015). It has, for example, been shown that genome size and GC content are related with the ecological strategies of the different marine bacteria, with free-living bacteria having lower GC content and smaller genomes, as compared to patch-associated bacteria (Luo and Moran, 2015). Also, it is expected that symbionts, parasites and commensals would experience genome reduction due to specialization (Morris et al., 2012; Giovannoni et al., 2014). Here, we observe that the smallest genomes and lower GC content are indeed found in the known symbiotic organisms (P. iliopiscarium, P. damselae, P. phosphoreum), but also in P. galatheae and P. halotolerans. This could be explained by genetic drift and streamlining, respectively (Giovannoni et al., 2014; Luo and Moran, 2015).  The only two closed genomes (P. profundum SS9 and P. gaetbulicola Gung47) have a larger and a smaller chromosome of approximately 4 and 2 Mb, plus megaplasmids of 80 and 35 Kb, respectively. The presence of 2 chromosomes is a trend of the Vibrionaceae family and it is assumed that the draft genomes used also include two chromosomes and large plasmids, but fully closed genomes would be required to assert this. The number of genes per genome was estimated using prodigalrunner and ranged from 4,041 to 7,027.  To visualize the protein-coding gene content conservation in the Photobacterium genus, we constructed a BLAST atlas using P. profundum SS9 and P. gaetbulicola Gung47 as reference genomes (Figure S6). As previously described for other members of the Vibrionaceae family (Thompson et al., 2009), the Photobacterium large chromosome seems to be more conserved between species than the smaller chromosome or plasmids (Figure S6). The smaller chromosomes are highly variable and harbor the main genomic differences between strains of the same species. These secondary chromosomes and plasmids therefore seem to be the source of the genetic plasticity, mirrored in the different phenotypes observed within members of the Photobacterium genus and Vibrionaceae family in general (Vesth et al., 2010; Lukjancenko and Ussery, 2014). A well-studied example is V. splendidus, where the genomes of strains from the same species vary and result in distinct phenotypic capabilities (Thompson J. R. et al., 2005; Hunt et al., 2008a). This diversity is also evident for the Photobacterium species in the several genetic features analyzed, such as virulence, bioluminescence, histamine production, secondary metabolism and CRISPR-Cas operons. All these genomic features presented random distributions rarely correlated with phylogenetic relatedness (Figure 4), raising the issue of species-phenotype association within the Photobacterium genus. Nevertheless, genomic features such as genome size and GC content seem to be associated with different lifestyles adopted by Photobacterium species.  Figure 4  Summary figure of some of the shared genomic traits between the Photobacterium strains. The phylogenetic tree is based on the MLSA phylogenetic distances. Squares represent the lux-rib operon, color-coded for the different gene cluster architectures. Triangles indicate the presence of genes coding for histamine producing proteins. Hexagons indicate the presence of CRISPR-Cas loci, color-coded for the different gene cluster architectures. Inverted triangles indicate the common prophages, each different also color-coded. Circles represent antiSMASH hits: brown for aryl-polyene biosynthetic gene cluster; yellow for ectoine biosynthetic gene cluster; blue for terpene biosynthetic gene cluster; white for polyunsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis gene cluster; and green for NRPS biosynthetic gene clusters.  Bioluminescence for example was initially thought to be a widespread feature of the genus (Urbanczyk et al., 2011). We identified the genetic basis for bioluminescence only in three species P. kishitanii, P. phosphoreum, and P. leiognathi (Figure S5), isolated from different marine animals (Table S1). This also compared with the phylogenetic analysis (Figure 2A), with the exception of P. iliopiscarium, that may have lost this trait due to niche adaptation (Figure 4). Analysis of the lux-rib operon further showed that strains ATCC 25521, ATCC 33979 and Irivu.4.1 are most likely P. leiognathi subsp. leiognathi, according to their lux-rib gene organization (Figure S5) (Ast and Dunlap, 2004). Similarly, histamine production seems to be specific for P. kishitanii and P. damselae, however genes responsible for this feature could be identified also in one P. angustum strain (ATCC 33977) (Figure S7). Scombrotoxin fish poisoning (high levels of histamine) is the most frequent cause of fish poisoning incidents within the United States (Pennotti et al., 2013). Recently, high-histamine producing Photobacterium strains have been isolated from freshly caught fish (Bjornsdottir-Butler et al., 2016), raising awareness for the need to revise food safety rules regarding sea food. There are also several reports describing P. phosphoreum as histamine producing species (Kanki et al., 2004, 2007), but we did not identify the genes responsible for histamine production in P. phosphoreum ATCC 11040, although it may be present in other P. phosphoreum strains.  Pan- and core-genome  The pan-genome refers to the total number of genes in all the 35 strains, while the core genome represents the number of orthologous genes shared between them. Using 35 genomes we identified a pan-genome of 28,951 genes and a core-genome of 1,232 genes (Figure 5). Taking into consideration the average gene number of 4,750 for the Photobacterium strains, 1,232 genes, represents approximately 25% of the total genome, meaning that approximately 1/4 of the genome is conserved in all the strains. The number of core-genome genes is in agreement with what has been found in other marine Gammaproteobacteria (Qin et al., 2013), although this is two times higher than what has been found for the Vibrio genus, where the core-genome comprised approximately 500 genes (Thompson et al., 2009). This difference can be explained by the high number of Vibrio species (more than 120), which reflects the genomic and ecological diversity of the genus.  Figure 5  Pan- and core-genome plot of the 35 Photobacterium strains. The pan- and core-genome calculation was performed using protein sequence BLAST with identity/query coverage cutoff of 50/50. Proteins matching were considered the same gene family. Proteins present in all the tested genomes were considered part of the core-genome.  The pan-genome for the Photobacterium genus alone is greater than what has been reported in a study of the Vibrionaceae family, where 43 genomes of a total of 13 species from three different genera were used (Thompson et al., 2009). This suggests Photobacterium harbors high genomic diversity, reflected in their ability to colonize different environmental niches (Konstantinidis and Tiedje, 2004; Konstantinidis et al., 2009) and supports the theory that high gene content variation exists in environmental marine strains (Tettelin et al., 2008; Konstantinidis et al., 2009). Using a power-law regression, it is possible to evaluate the openness of a pan-genome (Tettelin et al., 2008). The Photobacterium pan-genome is open, with a γ parameter of 0.62 in a power-law regression fitting relatively well the data analyzed (R2 = 0.89) (Figure S8). This genetic variation and uniqueness of each strain is also evident in the number of singletons per strain, which for some strains represent almost 20% of the genes identified in the genome (Table S3).  Plasmids and virulence genes  Most Photobacterium species have been described as symbiotic or associated with other marine organisms (Ast et al., 2007; Dunlap, 2009; Gomez-Gil et al., 2011; Urbanczyk et al., 2011, 2013). Furthermore, some strains of P. damselae are pathogens of marine organisms, especially fish (Hundenborn et al., 2013; Andreoni and Magnani, 2014). The key virulence genes of P. damselae are a phospholipase-D damselysin gene (dly) and a pore-forming toxin gene (hlyA), which act in a synergistic manner (Rivas et al., 2011, 2013; Le Roux et al., 2015). We conducted a homology search to evaluate the possible virulence of other Photobacterium species. The genes could only be identified in P. damselae subsp. damselae CIP 102761. In this strain, two copies of the hlyA gene were identified, one in contig_1, close to an IS4 transposase and a phage integrase and the other in contig_4, next to the dly gene.  Often draft-whole genome sequences contain plasmid sequences. Plasmids are important mediators of several physiological traits of Photobacterium, such as virulence, drug resistance and biosynthetic capabilities (Kim et al., 2008; Rivas et al., 2011; Nonaka et al., 2012; Osorio et al., 2015). We compared known Photobacterium plasmids to the here studied genomes. Plasmid pPHDD1 showed high similarity to contig_4 of P. damselae subsp. damselae CIP 102761 genome. Some of the contigs of P. damselae subsp. piscicida DI21 also had high similarity to plasmids pPHDP60, pPHDP10 and pPHDP70, which have been previously isolated from this strain (Osorio et al., 2008, 2015).  Evidence of horizontal gene transfer (HGT)  The genetic exchange of foreign DNA by means of transposable elements, phage infection or conjugative plasmids has been suggested as a driving force in the evolution of members of Vibrionaceae (Reen et al., 2006; Vitulo et al., 2007; Gu et al., 2009; Lilburn et al., 2010; Urbanczyk et al., 2011). HGT can occur by uptake of environmental DNA, conjugative plasmids and bacteriophage infection. In the Photobacterium genus, studies on HGT are limited to the lux-rib operon, and a chitinase A and deoxyribodipyrimidine photolyase genes (Urbanczyk et al., 2008, 2012; Hunt et al., 2008b; Lauro et al., 2014) Here, we searched for evidence of genomic exchange by identifying prophages, transposases, CRISPR-Cas systems, genomic islands and secondary metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters.  Genomic islands and transposases  Using Island Viewer (Dhillon et al., 2015), we searched for genomic islands in the fully sequenced genomes of P. profundum SS9 and P. gaetbulicola Gung47, and compared these to genomes of other strains from the same species (Figure 6). Some of the major genetic differences between the strains of the same species seem indeed to be related to the presence or absence of specific genomic islands. Genomic regions only present in the reference strain are placed close to identified genomic islands.  Figure 6  Identification of genomic islands in the fully sequenced genomes of P. profundum SS9 and of P. gaetbulicola Gung47. The genomes of the mentioned strains are compared to the genome of another strain of the same species, P. profundum 3CTK and P. gaetbulicola AD005, respectively. The circle inside the BLAST atlas shows the Island Viewer results (integrated results in red, SIGI-HMM in orange and IslandPath-DIMOB in blue).  Additionally, strains varied in their number of transposase genes (Table S3). While P. profundum SS9 had 219 transposase genes, P. leioghnathi subsp. mandapamensis svers.1.1. had none. No correlation between number of prophages and number of transposase genes was observed. A high number of transposase genes could indicate transposon-mediated exchange of genetic material from any source (both plasmid-borne and random environmental DNA). P. profundum SS9 and Photobacterium sp. SKA34 are cases where transposase genes represent almost 4% of the total genes in the genome (Table S3). This is in accordance with metagenomics data that showed that transposase coding genes are the most abundant genes in nature, most likely accelerating biological diversification and evolution (Aziz et al., 2010) and that a higher number of transposase genes is present in higher oceanic depths (Konstantinidis et al., 2009).  Prophages and CRISPR-Cas systems  Using the PHAge Search Tool (PHAST) (Zhou et al., 2011) we identified 33 intact prophage sequences and 72 incomplete ones (Table S3). From the 33 intact ones, 17 were unique, while the other 16 were re-occurrences of three prophages. One was present only in P. profundum strains; another in all P. kishitanii strains, plus one P. damselae and one P. angustum; and the third was randomly distributed (Figure 4).  The bacterial and archaeal adaptive immune systems entail CRISPR-Cas modules (Makarova et al., 2015) and we queried the genomes for the architecture of the CRISPR-Cas systems including the cas gene organization, the direct repeats (DR) and the protospacers in the CRISPR locus. We divided the architecture of the CRISPR-Cas systems into seven clusters (Figure 7). Most of the architectures identified were similar to the ones described in Yersinia pestis, Escherichia coli and Desulfovibrio vulgaris (Figures 7A–C; Haft et al., 2005). Also, we identified two clusters in P. profundum SS9 similar to the ones of Y. pestis and E. coli, encoded in the chromosome and plasmid, respectively (Figures 7D,E). These clusters had different gene arrangement and/or included genes coding for unknown proteins in the operon. Two other clusters containing CRISPR-associated genes were identified (Figures 7F,G).  Figure 7  Different CRISPR/Cas subtypes identified across the Photobacterium genomes. CRIPR/Cas similar to Yersinia pestis  (A), Escherichia coli  (B) and Desulfovibrio vulgaris  (C), and other gene organizations (D–G). The numbers in brackets correspond to the number of protospacers identified in that region.  The estimation of DRs and protospacers in the CRISPR arrays is very difficult in draft genomes due to the short sequencing reads and the repetitive nature of the sequences, which make them difficult to assemble correctly. In most of the cases, both direct repeats and protospacers could be identified both upstream and downstream of the cas-operon. These were also identified elsewhere in the genome or in distinct contigs, usually consisting of one of the ends of the contig. For example, further upstream from the Tn7 in the P. galatheae S2753 (Figure 7G), an array of 16 protospacers could be identified beside a gene coding for a DNA nicking enzyme.  The DRs that flanked the protospacers were extracted and compared. The similarity of the DRs correlated with the type of clusters the strain had. DRs from clusters (a) and (d) were similar, as were the ones within (b) and (f). The protospacers are short sequences that are derived from bacteriophages or other foreign DNA, such as conjugative plasmids (Attar, 2015; Makarova et al., 2015). Therefore, these sequences may provide a history of encounters of a specific bacterium with phages and/or plasmids. The number of spacers varied considerable between different strains, from 1 to 64 protospacers in the same CRISPR array. Arrays with extensive number of protospacers in some strains indicate numerous bacteriophage infections, which is the case of e.g., P. profundum SS9, P. angustum S14 and P. aquae CGMCC 1.12159 with 64, 45, and 33 protospacers, respectively (Figure 7). The 4 spacers in P. leiognathi lrivu.4.1 were 100% identical to the first 4 spacers in P. angustum S14, which had an array of 45 spacers. Also high similarity (>93% Identity) could be identified in the first spacers of P. angustum ATCC 25915, ATCC 33975 and P. damselae subsp. damselae ATCC 33539 (which should be classified as P. angustum), although for the P. angustum strains the protospacers have not just been identified downstream of the cas operon, but elsewhere.  We have also compared the protospacers to the prophage sequences identified in these genomes. The bacterial immune system (CRISPR-Cas) allows the protection against re-infection by the same bacteriophage (Attar, 2015), nevertheless, for P. angustum ATCC 33975 an array of 9 sequential spacers were 100% identical to an intact prophage sequence identified within the same genome, suggesting multiple re-infection events.  Phage infection seems to be a frequent event in some strains, supported by the extensive number of protospacers in the CRISPR arrays and the number of prophages within the genomes (Figure 7). Remarkably, the cas operons previously associated with E. coli, D. vulgaris and Y. pestis were identified in Photobacterium strains (Haft et al., 2005). Yet, presence/absence and type of cluster seems randomly spread across the different species (Figure 4).  Secondary metabolism  Another indication of high genomic exchange is the number and distribution of secondary metabolism biosynthetic clusters, many of which are believed to be acquired by HGT (Khaldi et al., 2008). Secondary metabolites such as non-ribosomal peptides and polyketides are known to have antagonistic properties, which may constitute an advantage in several ecological niches. Although Photobacterium strains have mostly been studied due to their association with marine animals, their potential in drug discovery and other applications has recently been reported (Wietz et al., 2010b; Machado et al., 2014, 2015a,b; Nielsen et al., 2014; Mathew et al., 2015a,b).  Using antiSMASH 3.0 (Weber et al., 2015), different biosynthetic gene clusters were identified (Table S4) with some clusters being present across the genus and others being species specific (Figure 4). The same terpene biosynthetic cluster could be identified in all the P. angustum strains (including the misidentified P. damselae subsp. damselae ATCC 33539). The function of this terpene cluster is not known, but it may be related to the planktonic lifestyle of this species, since all the P. angustum strains were isolated from seawater. Another species-specific cluster was the polyunsaturated fatty-acid (PUFA) cluster present in P. profundum strains. This cluster could be involved in the high pressure and cold temperature adaptation of this species, since these PUFAs are known to modify membrane fluidity in response to hydrostatic pressure and temperature (Campanaro et al., 2005).  Other biosynthetic clusters such as siderophore, aryl-polyene and ectoine were widely distributed across the genus (Figure 4). A siderophore cluster was present in 11 strains, although two distinct siderophore biosynthetic clusters were identified. The ectoine cluster was present in 18 strains (two had only two out of three genes needed for its biosynthesis). The most widely distributed cluster was the aryl-polyene biosynthetic cluster, identified in 23 out of the 35 strains. Interestingly strains associated with marine animals did not have a siderophore cluster nor were they prolific in other secondary metabolite clusters (Figure 4, Figure S4). Strains isolated from seawater or sediments seem to be enriched in secondary metabolite clusters, when compared to marine animal associated species. These strains have therefore the genetic capability of possibly antagonizing microbial competitors in their environment.  The distribution of secondary metabolite clusters suggests events of gain and loss of these clusters throughout the evolution of Photobacterium species. The random presence of specific traits, i.e., not phylogenetically related, has been reported for other genus. For example, in Pseudovibrio the random distribution of type IV secretion systems was attributed to the frequency with which those genes are horizontally acquired (Cascales and Christie, 2003; Romano et al., 2016). In fact, several of the interesting phenotypic traits identified in Photobacterium strains, such as bioluminescence, virulence, histamine production and piezophilia seem to be acquired by HGT (Ast and Dunlap, 2004; Campanaro et al., 2005; Dunlap, 2009; Urbanczyk et al., 2011; Hundenborn et al., 2013; Andreoni and Magnani, 2014; Osorio et al., 2015; Bjornsdottir-Butler et al., 2016).

PMC5489566,Abstract,Abstract,KC344732,0,0,0,,,"  Vibrionaceae is a large marine bacterial family, which can constitute up to 50% of the prokaryotic population in marine waters. Photobacterium is the second largest genus in the family and we used comparative genomics on 35 strains representing 16 of the 28 species described so far, to understand the genomic diversity present in the Photobacterium genus. Such understanding is important for ecophysiology studies of the genus. We used whole genome sequences to evaluate phylogenetic relationships using several analyses (16S rRNA, MLSA, fur, amino-acid usage, ANI), which allowed us to identify two misidentified strains. Genome analyses also revealed occurrence of higher and lower GC content clades, correlating with phylogenetic clusters. Pan- and core-genome analysis revealed the conservation of 25% of the genome throughout the genus, with a large and open pan-genome. The major source of genomic diversity could be traced to the smaller chromosome and plasmids. Several of the physiological traits studied in the genus did not correlate with phylogenetic data. Since horizontal gene transfer (HGT) is often suggested as a source of genetic diversity and a potential driver of genomic evolution in bacterial species, we looked into evidence of such in Photobacterium genomes. Genomic islands were the source of genomic differences between strains of the same species. Also, we found transposase genes and CRISPR arrays that suggest multiple encounters with foreign DNA. Presence of genomic exchange traits was widespread and abundant in the genus, suggesting a role in genomic evolution. The high genetic variability and indications of genetic exchange make it difficult to elucidate genome evolutionary paths and raise the awareness of the roles of foreign DNA in the genomic evolution of environmental organisms.

We found a high genomic diversity within this genus, and some genomic traits appear to be related to lifestyle, such as GC content, genome size, bioluminescence, secondary metabolism and virulence. We evaluated genomic traits related to genomic exchange such as prophage infection, presence of genomic islands and genes coding for transposases and show that these are abundant in the Photobacterium genus, indicating numerous genomic changes throughout evolution of the genus. Genomic exchange might therefore be the strongest driver in the genomic evolution of this genus, reflected in the different lifestyles of the species.  ",FALSE,TRUE,

PMC5489566,Introduction,Introduction,KC344732,0,0,0,,,"  Introduction  Oceans cover 70% of Planet Earth and it has been estimated to harbor an extensive unexplored genomic potential (Sunagawa et al., 2015). The rapid development in sequencing technologies and the focus on improved cultivation of hitherto uncultured microorganisms has dramatically increased our understanding of both diversity and biotechnological potential found in the marine habitats (Zengler et al., 2002; Lasken, 2012; Mardis, 2013; Choi et al., 2015; Loman and Pallen, 2015; Sunagawa et al., 2015). Vibrionaceae is a prominent marine bacterial family and it represents 0.8% of the bacterial population as found in the Tara oceans metagenomic data (Sunagawa et al., 2015). Based on molecular assessment, it can constitute up to 50% of the prokaryotic population in marine waters (Wietz et al., 2010a; Gilbert et al., 2012). Vibrio is the largest genus within this family (73% in Tara oceans data) and it has been extensively studied, in part due to the importance of the human pathogen V. cholerae (Meibom et al., 2004; Stauder et al., 2012; Kim et al., 2015; Papenfort et al., 2015; Rajpara et al., 2015). The genus Photobacterium (16%) is the second largest genus of the family, followed by Aliivibrio (3%).  Species belonging to the Vibrionaceae family are believed to be very similar (Vitulo et al., 2007). However, most studies have been based on Vibrio species, and only a few have included Photobacterium strains. Recent metagenomic data shows that although these two genera seem to have similar ecological strategies, Photobacterium spp. dominates in the lower pelagic depths (surface water layer and deep chlorophyll maximum layer) while Vibrio spp. is more prevalent in higher depths (mesopelagic zone) (Figure 1; Sunagawa et al., 2015). This suggests different ecological strategies and roles of the two genera.  Figure 1  Taxonomic composition of the Vibrionaceae family at different pelagic depths. The data was retrieved from the Tara oceans project, and included stations where information was acquired for the three depths (Sunagawa et al., 2015). The rings represent the different depths: surface water layer—down to 5 m depth (outer ring); deep chlorophyll maximum layer—from 5 to 200 m depth (middle ring); and mesopelagic zone—from 250 to 1,000 m depth (inner ring).  Photobacterium includes species with different life-styles: free-living, symbiotic or pathogenic (Urbanczyk et al., 2011). The genus currently covers 28 species of which 26 have validly published names (www.bacterio.net) (“P. atrarenae” and “P. marinum” are not yet validly published names) (Gomez-Gil et al., 2011; Kim et al., 2011; Lucena et al., 2011; Urbanczyk et al., 2011; Srinivas et al., 2013; Figge et al., 2014; Liu et al., 2014; Lo et al., 2014; Moreira et al., 2014; Machado et al., 2015a). Of these 28, only 27 are available since no type strain was deposited for P. aplysiae, (Seo et al., 2005; Holmes and Farmer, 2008). Twenty-two of the 28 species have been described during the last 15 years, making it a relatively new genus.  The majority of Photobacterium strains have been isolated from marine environments, although isolation of a P. halotolerans from the rhizosphere of a terrestrial weed has recently been reported (Mathew et al., 2015a,b). All species of this genus were originally thought to be luminescent, but it has become clear that a large number of species are not luminescent (Lucena et al., 2011; Urbanczyk et al., 2011). This ecological important characteristic is part of the symbiotic life style of some Photobacterium species and is attributed to the expression of the lux-rib operon (Dunlap, 2009). This operon has been used taxonomically for the division of the genus into clades (Ast and Dunlap, 2004; Urbanczyk et al., 2011).  Recently, we and other scientists have sequenced the genomes of several strains of this genus, representing a total of 16 different species. Most of the strains have been isolated from the marine environment, although with different approaches and goals (Table S1). Some were isolated as symbionts of marine animals, others from spoiled fish, and others host-associated with oysters, crabs and fish (Ast et al., 2007; Gomez-Gil et al., 2011; Urbanczyk et al., 2011; Bjornsdottir-Butler et al., 2016). Some were isolated as free-living organisms from coastal or pelagic waters (Nogi et al., 1998), and P. galatheae S2753 was isolated due to its antagonism against pathogenic bacteria (Gram et al., 2010; Machado et al., 2015a).  The purpose of the present study was to use this recent genomic information to investigate the genomic diversity within the genus, and analyzed the possible genetic foundation of known physiological traits. These analyses allow a better understanding of the genus phylogeny by elucidating evolutionary relationships using genomic information; it reveals the genomic diversity existent within the genus and the role of foreign DNA in genomic diversity acquisition.

Calculation of basic genome statistics such as size, GC content and amino acid usage was done using the CMG biotools (Vesth et al., 2013). These tools were also used for gene finding using prodigalrunner, generation of BLAST atlases comparing the protein-coding open reading frames and for the pan- and core-genome analyses of the studied strains.  Phylogenetic analyses  The 16S rRNA gene sequences used are the publically available sequences originally published for each strain or obtained from the whole genome sequence when other sequence was not available. The gene sequences used for the MLSA (ftsZ, gapA, gyrB, mreB, pyrH, recA, rpoA) and the fur gene sequence, were obtained from the genomes using the CLC Main Workbench (CLC Aarhus, Denmark version 7) (Table S2). An annotation-based search was performed for the gene sequences of interest using the NCBI annotation. The genomes not annotated at NCBI were annotated using RAST (Aziz et al., 2008; Overbeek et al., 2014). The accession numbers for 16S rRNA gene sequences and the gene locus tags are provided in Table S2. The gene topA was not used in the MLSA, since no homologous sequence was found in the genome of P. galatheae S2753. Alignments and Maximum Likelihood Phylogeny trees were done using CLC Main Workbench. Maximum Likelihood Phylogeny trees were constructed using the Neighbor Joining method with the Jukes-Cantor nucleotide distance measure. The topology of the tree was tested with 1,000 bootstrap replications. MEGA 6 was used to finalize the tree design (Tamura et al., 2013).  The Genome-to-Genome Distance Calculator by DSMZ was used to determine in silico DNA-DNA re-association percent values (Auch et al., 2010), and the Average Nucleotide Identity (ANI) calculator to estimate the ANI values (Goris et al., 2007). The nucleotide identity percentages for the fur gene and the MLSA were calculated using the pair-wise comparison tool of CLC Main Workbench.  lux-rib operon  The lux genes were identified by homology search to previously described genes (Ast and Dunlap, 2004; Urbanczyk et al., 2008, 2012) using protein sequence BLAST tools of CLC Main Workbench with identity/query coverage cutoff of 50/50. Identified lux operons were then blasted against whole genome sequences of the studied Photobacterium strains using MultiGeneBLAST (Medema et al., 2013).  Identification of prophages, genomic islands and secondary metabolite clusters  Prophages, genomic islands and secondary metabolite clusters were identified using the online tools PHAST, IslandViewer 3 and antiSMASH 3.0, respectively (Zhou et al., 2011; Dhillon et al., 2015; Weber et al., 2015). The whole genome sequences were submitted to the different tools, and the identified clusters compared using MultiGeneBLAST (Medema et al., 2013).  CRISPR-cas  Genome sequences were analyzed in CRISPRfinder (Grissa et al., 2007) and homology searches for CRISPR associated genes were performed using CLC Main Workbench. Using the CLC Main Workbench BLAST tool, direct repeats and protospacers were compared among each other and to previously identified prophages. Confirmation of cas genes was performed by BLAST comparison of the identified open-reading frames to the NCBI nucleotide database.  Plasmid comparison and virulence genes  We used previously described Photobacterium plasmids to search the genomes for contigs belonging to plasmids using CLC Main Workbench. Plasmids used in the search included: pPHDD1 (FN597600.2), pAQU1 (AB571865.1), pP99-018 (AB277723.1), pP91278 (AB277724.1), pPHDP60 (KC344732.1), pPHDP10 (DQ069059.1), pPHDP70 (KP100338.1), pP9014 (AB453229.1), pPH1 (AY789019.1), pPBPR1 (CR377818.1), and the unnamed plasmid from P. gaetbulicola Gung47 (KC687076.1).  Identification of virulence, histamine production, and transposase genes  The genes hlyA and dly are key virulence genes of P. damselae (Rivas et al., 2011, 2013; Le Roux et al., 2015). Virulence related genes were identified using the BLAST tools of CLC Main Workbench with protein identity/query coverage cutoff of 50/50. Also the genetic basis for histamine production was evaluated, by searching for genes related to histamine production, previously identified in Photobacterium strains (Bjornsdottir-Butler et al., 2016). An annotation based identification of transposase genes was performed in CLC Main Workbench.  Singleton analysis  The number of singletons per genome was calculated using the EDGAR platform for comparative genomics (Blom et al., 2009). A private project has been created by uploading the whole genome sequences of the studied Photobacterium strains and the analysis performed using default settings for singleton identification.

""Some of the contigs of P. damselae subsp. piscicida DI21 also had high similarity to plasmids pPHDP60, pPHDP10 and pPHDP70, which have been previously isolated from this strain""","  Results and discussion  Phylogeny  The 16S rRNA gene phylogeny is widely used in the classification of Photobacterium species and it is sometimes the only phylogenetic discrimination provided when new species are described (Park et al., 2006; Rivas et al., 2006; Gomez-Gil et al., 2011; Liu et al., 2014). However, this gene has low discriminatory power in resolving species relatedness; for instance, P. angustum strains appear scattered throughout the phylogenetic tree, and P. damselae subsp. piscicida DI21 and “P. marinum” AK15 cluster closely to V. pacinii DSM18139 (Figure S1).  The limitations of the use of the 16S rRNA gene as a phylogenetic marker in Vibrionaceae have been previously reported (Sawabe et al., 2007; Machado and Gram, 2015), and the use of Multi-Locus Sequence Analysis (MLSA) has been proposed when evaluating Vibrionaceae phylogenetic relationships (Thompson F. L. et al., 2005; Sawabe et al., 2007, 2013; Pascual et al., 2010; Gabriel et al., 2014). Here, we used several clustering methods to investigate the phylogenetic relationships within the Photobacterium genus. Different approaches (MLSA, fur, amino-acid usage, average nucleotide identity [ANI]) led to distinct phylogenetic results; nevertheless the core phylogenetic groups identified were the same (Figure 2, Figures S2, S3).  Figure 2  Phylogenetic trees. The trees were constructed using seven house-keeping genes (ftsZ, gapA, gyrB, mreB, pyrH, recA, rpoA) (A) and the fur gene (B). The topology of the tree was tested with 1,000 bootstrap replications, and Vibrio pacinii DSM 19139 used to root the tree.  In the MLSA, sequences of seven genes (ftsZ, gapA, gyrB, mreB, pyrH, recA, rpoA) allowed a phylogenetic evaluation using a concatenation length of 7,230 bp. Here, strains belonging to the same species cluster tightly. The same was observed for the recently described identification marker, the ferric up-take regulator (fur) gene (Machado and Gram, 2015). The fur gene has been described as a powerful identification marker in the Vibrionaceae family, however the phylogenetic relationships observed were different from the ones obtained using MLSA and whole genome sequence methods (amino-acid usage and ANI) (Figure 2, Figures S2, S3).  The phylogenetic analysis showed a misidentification of two isolates, P. phosphoreum ANT-2200 and P. damselae subsp. damselae ATCC 33539. Based on our results, P. phosphoreum ANT-2200 should be classified as P. kishitanii, as has previously been suggested (Ast and Dunlap, 2004; Urbanczyk et al., 2011; Bjornsdottir-Butler et al., 2016), and was here confirmed by the phylogenetic assessment and the genomic analyses. The genome identified as belonging to P. damselae subsp. damselae ATCC 33539 was similar to the ones of P. angustum, but the 16S rRNA gene phylogeny using the original sequence placed this strain elsewhere. In fact, partial (FJ971859) and complete (NR_040831) 16S rRNA sequences available for strain ATCC 33539 presented 52 and 68% of query coverage, respectively, with 94 and 96% of identity to the whole genome sequence identified as belonging to P. damselae subsp. damselae ATCC33539. Since no other physiological discrepancies have been previously reported, we believe that the case of P. damselae subsp. damselae ATCC 33539 might be a wrong whole genome sequence submission to NCBI or sequencing of a wrong strain.  This study did not clarify the phylogenetic association of P. damselae as MLSA, fur, ANI, amino-acid usage analyses placed it in different branches, confirming its unstable association (Lucena et al., 2011). In contrast, although the species “P. marinum” has not been recognized, we here show that the type-strain AK15 seems to be indeed the representative of a new species (Srinivas et al., 2013).  In order to provide a quantitative evaluation of the different phylogenetic approaches, in silico DNA-DNA hybridization, fur and MLSA percentage of identity values were calculated and correlated to the ANI. Comparing all the tested phylogenetic methods, resulted in correlation coefficients between 0.84 and 0.95 (Figure S4). Interestingly, the fur gene of approximately 450 bp correlated better with the ANI than the MLSA, which used approximately 6,800 bp more in the analysis. This strengthens the previous suggestion of the use of the fur gene in the classification of Vibrionaceae family strains (Machado and Gram, 2015). We therefore suggest the use of fur analysis in the future classification of new Photobacterium isolates, although MLSA should still be used to evaluate evolutionary relationships.  The division of the Photobacterium genus into two or three clades has been previously suggested (Lucena et al., 2011; Urbanczyk et al., 2011). The most recent review on this genus proposed two clades, based both on the molecular phylogenetic evaluation, but also on the creation of a luminous/symbiotic and a non-luminous/non-symbiotic clusters (Urbanczyk et al., 2011). Our results support the phylogenetic relationship previously observed between the species of each cluster, but the identification of genes responsible for luminescence suggest that P. angustum and P. damselae are not luminescent species as reported before (Urbanczyk et al., 2011; Figure S5). Some strains of P. damselae have acquired lux genes through horizontal gene transfer (HGT) (Urbanczyk et al., 2008), which might explain the absence of these genes in the studied strains. On the other hand, luminescence of P. angustum strains varies (Urbanczyk et al., 2011), but we could not identify lux genes in any of the six P. angustum strains. Furthermore, P. ganghwense has been defined as bioluminescent (Park et al., 2006); however, it has not been described how this feature was evaluated in the original study, nor could we identify lux genes in the genome of the type-strain. Therefore, the generic division of luminous vs. non-luminous clades should be avoided.  Genomic diversity  General genomic features  The Photobacterium genomes ranged in size from 4.2 to 6.4 Mb (Figure 3). The genome size range was in accordance with the ones reported for other genera from the Vibrionaceae family (Thompson et al., 2009). The largest genomes found belonged to P. profundum, which is an extremely versatile species. P. profundum SS9 is able to grow at cold temperatures and in pressurized environments (Eloe et al., 2008; Lauro et al., 2008, 2014). It seems therefore logical that such environmental versatility comes associated with a larger genome size (Konstantinidis and Tiedje, 2004).  Figure 3  Genome size and GC content of the studied genomes. The size is represented in mega-bases (Mb) by the horizontal bars and the percentage of GC by the black dots.  The GC content of the genomes varied between 38.7 and 50.9%, and the strains clustered in two groups based on GC%: one of approximately 40% and another of approximately 50%. The only exceptions were P. swingsii CAIM1393 and Photobacterium sp. AK15, which had a GC content of 43.4 and 46.2%, respectively. The GC content has been linked to a division of strains that also is reflected in their environmental conditions as well as to amino acid usage (Lightfield et al., 2011). Independently of the method used, the species with higher GC content clustered together, suggesting an evolutionary association of GC content and phylogenetic proximity within the genus (Figure 2).  Several theories for genome evolution in bacteria explaining smaller cell size and genomes, the different GC content, the genomic reductions and expansions have been presented and discussed (Moran et al., 2007; Hunt et al., 2008a; Newton et al., 2010; Morris et al., 2012; Fernández-Gómez et al., 2013; Giovannoni et al., 2014; Luo and Moran, 2015). It has, for example, been shown that genome size and GC content are related with the ecological strategies of the different marine bacteria, with free-living bacteria having lower GC content and smaller genomes, as compared to patch-associated bacteria (Luo and Moran, 2015). Also, it is expected that symbionts, parasites and commensals would experience genome reduction due to specialization (Morris et al., 2012; Giovannoni et al., 2014). Here, we observe that the smallest genomes and lower GC content are indeed found in the known symbiotic organisms (P. iliopiscarium, P. damselae, P. phosphoreum), but also in P. galatheae and P. halotolerans. This could be explained by genetic drift and streamlining, respectively (Giovannoni et al., 2014; Luo and Moran, 2015).  The only two closed genomes (P. profundum SS9 and P. gaetbulicola Gung47) have a larger and a smaller chromosome of approximately 4 and 2 Mb, plus megaplasmids of 80 and 35 Kb, respectively. The presence of 2 chromosomes is a trend of the Vibrionaceae family and it is assumed that the draft genomes used also include two chromosomes and large plasmids, but fully closed genomes would be required to assert this. The number of genes per genome was estimated using prodigalrunner and ranged from 4,041 to 7,027.  To visualize the protein-coding gene content conservation in the Photobacterium genus, we constructed a BLAST atlas using P. profundum SS9 and P. gaetbulicola Gung47 as reference genomes (Figure S6). As previously described for other members of the Vibrionaceae family (Thompson et al., 2009), the Photobacterium large chromosome seems to be more conserved between species than the smaller chromosome or plasmids (Figure S6). The smaller chromosomes are highly variable and harbor the main genomic differences between strains of the same species. These secondary chromosomes and plasmids therefore seem to be the source of the genetic plasticity, mirrored in the different phenotypes observed within members of the Photobacterium genus and Vibrionaceae family in general (Vesth et al., 2010; Lukjancenko and Ussery, 2014). A well-studied example is V. splendidus, where the genomes of strains from the same species vary and result in distinct phenotypic capabilities (Thompson J. R. et al., 2005; Hunt et al., 2008a). This diversity is also evident for the Photobacterium species in the several genetic features analyzed, such as virulence, bioluminescence, histamine production, secondary metabolism and CRISPR-Cas operons. All these genomic features presented random distributions rarely correlated with phylogenetic relatedness (Figure 4), raising the issue of species-phenotype association within the Photobacterium genus. Nevertheless, genomic features such as genome size and GC content seem to be associated with different lifestyles adopted by Photobacterium species.  Figure 4  Summary figure of some of the shared genomic traits between the Photobacterium strains. The phylogenetic tree is based on the MLSA phylogenetic distances. Squares represent the lux-rib operon, color-coded for the different gene cluster architectures. Triangles indicate the presence of genes coding for histamine producing proteins. Hexagons indicate the presence of CRISPR-Cas loci, color-coded for the different gene cluster architectures. Inverted triangles indicate the common prophages, each different also color-coded. Circles represent antiSMASH hits: brown for aryl-polyene biosynthetic gene cluster; yellow for ectoine biosynthetic gene cluster; blue for terpene biosynthetic gene cluster; white for polyunsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis gene cluster; and green for NRPS biosynthetic gene clusters.  Bioluminescence for example was initially thought to be a widespread feature of the genus (Urbanczyk et al., 2011). We identified the genetic basis for bioluminescence only in three species P. kishitanii, P. phosphoreum, and P. leiognathi (Figure S5), isolated from different marine animals (Table S1). This also compared with the phylogenetic analysis (Figure 2A), with the exception of P. iliopiscarium, that may have lost this trait due to niche adaptation (Figure 4). Analysis of the lux-rib operon further showed that strains ATCC 25521, ATCC 33979 and Irivu.4.1 are most likely P. leiognathi subsp. leiognathi, according to their lux-rib gene organization (Figure S5) (Ast and Dunlap, 2004). Similarly, histamine production seems to be specific for P. kishitanii and P. damselae, however genes responsible for this feature could be identified also in one P. angustum strain (ATCC 33977) (Figure S7). Scombrotoxin fish poisoning (high levels of histamine) is the most frequent cause of fish poisoning incidents within the United States (Pennotti et al., 2013). Recently, high-histamine producing Photobacterium strains have been isolated from freshly caught fish (Bjornsdottir-Butler et al., 2016), raising awareness for the need to revise food safety rules regarding sea food. There are also several reports describing P. phosphoreum as histamine producing species (Kanki et al., 2004, 2007), but we did not identify the genes responsible for histamine production in P. phosphoreum ATCC 11040, although it may be present in other P. phosphoreum strains.  Pan- and core-genome  The pan-genome refers to the total number of genes in all the 35 strains, while the core genome represents the number of orthologous genes shared between them. Using 35 genomes we identified a pan-genome of 28,951 genes and a core-genome of 1,232 genes (Figure 5). Taking into consideration the average gene number of 4,750 for the Photobacterium strains, 1,232 genes, represents approximately 25% of the total genome, meaning that approximately 1/4 of the genome is conserved in all the strains. The number of core-genome genes is in agreement with what has been found in other marine Gammaproteobacteria (Qin et al., 2013), although this is two times higher than what has been found for the Vibrio genus, where the core-genome comprised approximately 500 genes (Thompson et al., 2009). This difference can be explained by the high number of Vibrio species (more than 120), which reflects the genomic and ecological diversity of the genus.  Figure 5  Pan- and core-genome plot of the 35 Photobacterium strains. The pan- and core-genome calculation was performed using protein sequence BLAST with identity/query coverage cutoff of 50/50. Proteins matching were considered the same gene family. Proteins present in all the tested genomes were considered part of the core-genome.  The pan-genome for the Photobacterium genus alone is greater than what has been reported in a study of the Vibrionaceae family, where 43 genomes of a total of 13 species from three different genera were used (Thompson et al., 2009). This suggests Photobacterium harbors high genomic diversity, reflected in their ability to colonize different environmental niches (Konstantinidis and Tiedje, 2004; Konstantinidis et al., 2009) and supports the theory that high gene content variation exists in environmental marine strains (Tettelin et al., 2008; Konstantinidis et al., 2009). Using a power-law regression, it is possible to evaluate the openness of a pan-genome (Tettelin et al., 2008). The Photobacterium pan-genome is open, with a γ parameter of 0.62 in a power-law regression fitting relatively well the data analyzed (R2 = 0.89) (Figure S8). This genetic variation and uniqueness of each strain is also evident in the number of singletons per strain, which for some strains represent almost 20% of the genes identified in the genome (Table S3).  Plasmids and virulence genes  Most Photobacterium species have been described as symbiotic or associated with other marine organisms (Ast et al., 2007; Dunlap, 2009; Gomez-Gil et al., 2011; Urbanczyk et al., 2011, 2013). Furthermore, some strains of P. damselae are pathogens of marine organisms, especially fish (Hundenborn et al., 2013; Andreoni and Magnani, 2014). The key virulence genes of P. damselae are a phospholipase-D damselysin gene (dly) and a pore-forming toxin gene (hlyA), which act in a synergistic manner (Rivas et al., 2011, 2013; Le Roux et al., 2015). We conducted a homology search to evaluate the possible virulence of other Photobacterium species. The genes could only be identified in P. damselae subsp. damselae CIP 102761. In this strain, two copies of the hlyA gene were identified, one in contig_1, close to an IS4 transposase and a phage integrase and the other in contig_4, next to the dly gene.  Often draft-whole genome sequences contain plasmid sequences. Plasmids are important mediators of several physiological traits of Photobacterium, such as virulence, drug resistance and biosynthetic capabilities (Kim et al., 2008; Rivas et al., 2011; Nonaka et al., 2012; Osorio et al., 2015). We compared known Photobacterium plasmids to the here studied genomes. Plasmid pPHDD1 showed high similarity to contig_4 of P. damselae subsp. damselae CIP 102761 genome. Some of the contigs of P. damselae subsp. piscicida DI21 also had high similarity to plasmids pPHDP60, pPHDP10 and pPHDP70, which have been previously isolated from this strain (Osorio et al., 2008, 2015).  Evidence of horizontal gene transfer (HGT)  The genetic exchange of foreign DNA by means of transposable elements, phage infection or conjugative plasmids has been suggested as a driving force in the evolution of members of Vibrionaceae (Reen et al., 2006; Vitulo et al., 2007; Gu et al., 2009; Lilburn et al., 2010; Urbanczyk et al., 2011). HGT can occur by uptake of environmental DNA, conjugative plasmids and bacteriophage infection. In the Photobacterium genus, studies on HGT are limited to the lux-rib operon, and a chitinase A and deoxyribodipyrimidine photolyase genes (Urbanczyk et al., 2008, 2012; Hunt et al., 2008b; Lauro et al., 2014) Here, we searched for evidence of genomic exchange by identifying prophages, transposases, CRISPR-Cas systems, genomic islands and secondary metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters.  Genomic islands and transposases  Using Island Viewer (Dhillon et al., 2015), we searched for genomic islands in the fully sequenced genomes of P. profundum SS9 and P. gaetbulicola Gung47, and compared these to genomes of other strains from the same species (Figure 6). Some of the major genetic differences between the strains of the same species seem indeed to be related to the presence or absence of specific genomic islands. Genomic regions only present in the reference strain are placed close to identified genomic islands.  Figure 6  Identification of genomic islands in the fully sequenced genomes of P. profundum SS9 and of P. gaetbulicola Gung47. The genomes of the mentioned strains are compared to the genome of another strain of the same species, P. profundum 3CTK and P. gaetbulicola AD005, respectively. The circle inside the BLAST atlas shows the Island Viewer results (integrated results in red, SIGI-HMM in orange and IslandPath-DIMOB in blue).  Additionally, strains varied in their number of transposase genes (Table S3). While P. profundum SS9 had 219 transposase genes, P. leioghnathi subsp. mandapamensis svers.1.1. had none. No correlation between number of prophages and number of transposase genes was observed. A high number of transposase genes could indicate transposon-mediated exchange of genetic material from any source (both plasmid-borne and random environmental DNA). P. profundum SS9 and Photobacterium sp. SKA34 are cases where transposase genes represent almost 4% of the total genes in the genome (Table S3). This is in accordance with metagenomics data that showed that transposase coding genes are the most abundant genes in nature, most likely accelerating biological diversification and evolution (Aziz et al., 2010) and that a higher number of transposase genes is present in higher oceanic depths (Konstantinidis et al., 2009).  Prophages and CRISPR-Cas systems  Using the PHAge Search Tool (PHAST) (Zhou et al., 2011) we identified 33 intact prophage sequences and 72 incomplete ones (Table S3). From the 33 intact ones, 17 were unique, while the other 16 were re-occurrences of three prophages. One was present only in P. profundum strains; another in all P. kishitanii strains, plus one P. damselae and one P. angustum; and the third was randomly distributed (Figure 4).  The bacterial and archaeal adaptive immune systems entail CRISPR-Cas modules (Makarova et al., 2015) and we queried the genomes for the architecture of the CRISPR-Cas systems including the cas gene organization, the direct repeats (DR) and the protospacers in the CRISPR locus. We divided the architecture of the CRISPR-Cas systems into seven clusters (Figure 7). Most of the architectures identified were similar to the ones described in Yersinia pestis, Escherichia coli and Desulfovibrio vulgaris (Figures 7A–C; Haft et al., 2005). Also, we identified two clusters in P. profundum SS9 similar to the ones of Y. pestis and E. coli, encoded in the chromosome and plasmid, respectively (Figures 7D,E). These clusters had different gene arrangement and/or included genes coding for unknown proteins in the operon. Two other clusters containing CRISPR-associated genes were identified (Figures 7F,G).  Figure 7  Different CRISPR/Cas subtypes identified across the Photobacterium genomes. CRIPR/Cas similar to Yersinia pestis  (A), Escherichia coli  (B) and Desulfovibrio vulgaris  (C), and other gene organizations (D–G). The numbers in brackets correspond to the number of protospacers identified in that region.  The estimation of DRs and protospacers in the CRISPR arrays is very difficult in draft genomes due to the short sequencing reads and the repetitive nature of the sequences, which make them difficult to assemble correctly. In most of the cases, both direct repeats and protospacers could be identified both upstream and downstream of the cas-operon. These were also identified elsewhere in the genome or in distinct contigs, usually consisting of one of the ends of the contig. For example, further upstream from the Tn7 in the P. galatheae S2753 (Figure 7G), an array of 16 protospacers could be identified beside a gene coding for a DNA nicking enzyme.  The DRs that flanked the protospacers were extracted and compared. The similarity of the DRs correlated with the type of clusters the strain had. DRs from clusters (a) and (d) were similar, as were the ones within (b) and (f). The protospacers are short sequences that are derived from bacteriophages or other foreign DNA, such as conjugative plasmids (Attar, 2015; Makarova et al., 2015). Therefore, these sequences may provide a history of encounters of a specific bacterium with phages and/or plasmids. The number of spacers varied considerable between different strains, from 1 to 64 protospacers in the same CRISPR array. Arrays with extensive number of protospacers in some strains indicate numerous bacteriophage infections, which is the case of e.g., P. profundum SS9, P. angustum S14 and P. aquae CGMCC 1.12159 with 64, 45, and 33 protospacers, respectively (Figure 7). The 4 spacers in P. leiognathi lrivu.4.1 were 100% identical to the first 4 spacers in P. angustum S14, which had an array of 45 spacers. Also high similarity (>93% Identity) could be identified in the first spacers of P. angustum ATCC 25915, ATCC 33975 and P. damselae subsp. damselae ATCC 33539 (which should be classified as P. angustum), although for the P. angustum strains the protospacers have not just been identified downstream of the cas operon, but elsewhere.  We have also compared the protospacers to the prophage sequences identified in these genomes. The bacterial immune system (CRISPR-Cas) allows the protection against re-infection by the same bacteriophage (Attar, 2015), nevertheless, for P. angustum ATCC 33975 an array of 9 sequential spacers were 100% identical to an intact prophage sequence identified within the same genome, suggesting multiple re-infection events.  Phage infection seems to be a frequent event in some strains, supported by the extensive number of protospacers in the CRISPR arrays and the number of prophages within the genomes (Figure 7). Remarkably, the cas operons previously associated with E. coli, D. vulgaris and Y. pestis were identified in Photobacterium strains (Haft et al., 2005). Yet, presence/absence and type of cluster seems randomly spread across the different species (Figure 4).  Secondary metabolism  Another indication of high genomic exchange is the number and distribution of secondary metabolism biosynthetic clusters, many of which are believed to be acquired by HGT (Khaldi et al., 2008). Secondary metabolites such as non-ribosomal peptides and polyketides are known to have antagonistic properties, which may constitute an advantage in several ecological niches. Although Photobacterium strains have mostly been studied due to their association with marine animals, their potential in drug discovery and other applications has recently been reported (Wietz et al., 2010b; Machado et al., 2014, 2015a,b; Nielsen et al., 2014; Mathew et al., 2015a,b).  Using antiSMASH 3.0 (Weber et al., 2015), different biosynthetic gene clusters were identified (Table S4) with some clusters being present across the genus and others being species specific (Figure 4). The same terpene biosynthetic cluster could be identified in all the P. angustum strains (including the misidentified P. damselae subsp. damselae ATCC 33539). The function of this terpene cluster is not known, but it may be related to the planktonic lifestyle of this species, since all the P. angustum strains were isolated from seawater. Another species-specific cluster was the polyunsaturated fatty-acid (PUFA) cluster present in P. profundum strains. This cluster could be involved in the high pressure and cold temperature adaptation of this species, since these PUFAs are known to modify membrane fluidity in response to hydrostatic pressure and temperature (Campanaro et al., 2005).  Other biosynthetic clusters such as siderophore, aryl-polyene and ectoine were widely distributed across the genus (Figure 4). A siderophore cluster was present in 11 strains, although two distinct siderophore biosynthetic clusters were identified. The ectoine cluster was present in 18 strains (two had only two out of three genes needed for its biosynthesis). The most widely distributed cluster was the aryl-polyene biosynthetic cluster, identified in 23 out of the 35 strains. Interestingly strains associated with marine animals did not have a siderophore cluster nor were they prolific in other secondary metabolite clusters (Figure 4, Figure S4). Strains isolated from seawater or sediments seem to be enriched in secondary metabolite clusters, when compared to marine animal associated species. These strains have therefore the genetic capability of possibly antagonizing microbial competitors in their environment.  The distribution of secondary metabolite clusters suggests events of gain and loss of these clusters throughout the evolution of Photobacterium species. The random presence of specific traits, i.e., not phylogenetically related, has been reported for other genus. For example, in Pseudovibrio the random distribution of type IV secretion systems was attributed to the frequency with which those genes are horizontally acquired (Cascales and Christie, 2003; Romano et al., 2016). In fact, several of the interesting phenotypic traits identified in Photobacterium strains, such as bioluminescence, virulence, histamine production and piezophilia seem to be acquired by HGT (Ast and Dunlap, 2004; Campanaro et al., 2005; Dunlap, 2009; Urbanczyk et al., 2011; Hundenborn et al., 2013; Andreoni and Magnani, 2014; Osorio et al., 2015; Bjornsdottir-Butler et al., 2016).

PMC5489566,Abstract,Abstract,KP100338,0,0,0,,,"  Vibrionaceae is a large marine bacterial family, which can constitute up to 50% of the prokaryotic population in marine waters. Photobacterium is the second largest genus in the family and we used comparative genomics on 35 strains representing 16 of the 28 species described so far, to understand the genomic diversity present in the Photobacterium genus. Such understanding is important for ecophysiology studies of the genus. We used whole genome sequences to evaluate phylogenetic relationships using several analyses (16S rRNA, MLSA, fur, amino-acid usage, ANI), which allowed us to identify two misidentified strains. Genome analyses also revealed occurrence of higher and lower GC content clades, correlating with phylogenetic clusters. Pan- and core-genome analysis revealed the conservation of 25% of the genome throughout the genus, with a large and open pan-genome. The major source of genomic diversity could be traced to the smaller chromosome and plasmids. Several of the physiological traits studied in the genus did not correlate with phylogenetic data. Since horizontal gene transfer (HGT) is often suggested as a source of genetic diversity and a potential driver of genomic evolution in bacterial species, we looked into evidence of such in Photobacterium genomes. Genomic islands were the source of genomic differences between strains of the same species. Also, we found transposase genes and CRISPR arrays that suggest multiple encounters with foreign DNA. Presence of genomic exchange traits was widespread and abundant in the genus, suggesting a role in genomic evolution. The high genetic variability and indications of genetic exchange make it difficult to elucidate genome evolutionary paths and raise the awareness of the roles of foreign DNA in the genomic evolution of environmental organisms.

PMC5489566,Introduction,Introduction,KP100338,0,0,0,,,"  Introduction  Oceans cover 70% of Planet Earth and it has been estimated to harbor an extensive unexplored genomic potential (Sunagawa et al., 2015). The rapid development in sequencing technologies and the focus on improved cultivation of hitherto uncultured microorganisms has dramatically increased our understanding of both diversity and biotechnological potential found in the marine habitats (Zengler et al., 2002; Lasken, 2012; Mardis, 2013; Choi et al., 2015; Loman and Pallen, 2015; Sunagawa et al., 2015). Vibrionaceae is a prominent marine bacterial family and it represents 0.8% of the bacterial population as found in the Tara oceans metagenomic data (Sunagawa et al., 2015). Based on molecular assessment, it can constitute up to 50% of the prokaryotic population in marine waters (Wietz et al., 2010a; Gilbert et al., 2012). Vibrio is the largest genus within this family (73% in Tara oceans data) and it has been extensively studied, in part due to the importance of the human pathogen V. cholerae (Meibom et al., 2004; Stauder et al., 2012; Kim et al., 2015; Papenfort et al., 2015; Rajpara et al., 2015). The genus Photobacterium (16%) is the second largest genus of the family, followed by Aliivibrio (3%).  Species belonging to the Vibrionaceae family are believed to be very similar (Vitulo et al., 2007). However, most studies have been based on Vibrio species, and only a few have included Photobacterium strains. Recent metagenomic data shows that although these two genera seem to have similar ecological strategies, Photobacterium spp. dominates in the lower pelagic depths (surface water layer and deep chlorophyll maximum layer) while Vibrio spp. is more prevalent in higher depths (mesopelagic zone) (Figure 1; Sunagawa et al., 2015). This suggests different ecological strategies and roles of the two genera.  Figure 1  Taxonomic composition of the Vibrionaceae family at different pelagic depths. The data was retrieved from the Tara oceans project, and included stations where information was acquired for the three depths (Sunagawa et al., 2015). The rings represent the different depths: surface water layer—down to 5 m depth (outer ring); deep chlorophyll maximum layer—from 5 to 200 m depth (middle ring); and mesopelagic zone—from 250 to 1,000 m depth (inner ring).  Photobacterium includes species with different life-styles: free-living, symbiotic or pathogenic (Urbanczyk et al., 2011). The genus currently covers 28 species of which 26 have validly published names (www.bacterio.net) (“P. atrarenae” and “P. marinum” are not yet validly published names) (Gomez-Gil et al., 2011; Kim et al., 2011; Lucena et al., 2011; Urbanczyk et al., 2011; Srinivas et al., 2013; Figge et al., 2014; Liu et al., 2014; Lo et al., 2014; Moreira et al., 2014; Machado et al., 2015a). Of these 28, only 27 are available since no type strain was deposited for P. aplysiae, (Seo et al., 2005; Holmes and Farmer, 2008). Twenty-two of the 28 species have been described during the last 15 years, making it a relatively new genus.  The majority of Photobacterium strains have been isolated from marine environments, although isolation of a P. halotolerans from the rhizosphere of a terrestrial weed has recently been reported (Mathew et al., 2015a,b). All species of this genus were originally thought to be luminescent, but it has become clear that a large number of species are not luminescent (Lucena et al., 2011; Urbanczyk et al., 2011). This ecological important characteristic is part of the symbiotic life style of some Photobacterium species and is attributed to the expression of the lux-rib operon (Dunlap, 2009). This operon has been used taxonomically for the division of the genus into clades (Ast and Dunlap, 2004; Urbanczyk et al., 2011).  Recently, we and other scientists have sequenced the genomes of several strains of this genus, representing a total of 16 different species. Most of the strains have been isolated from the marine environment, although with different approaches and goals (Table S1). Some were isolated as symbionts of marine animals, others from spoiled fish, and others host-associated with oysters, crabs and fish (Ast et al., 2007; Gomez-Gil et al., 2011; Urbanczyk et al., 2011; Bjornsdottir-Butler et al., 2016). Some were isolated as free-living organisms from coastal or pelagic waters (Nogi et al., 1998), and P. galatheae S2753 was isolated due to its antagonism against pathogenic bacteria (Gram et al., 2010; Machado et al., 2015a).  The purpose of the present study was to use this recent genomic information to investigate the genomic diversity within the genus, and analyzed the possible genetic foundation of known physiological traits.

Calculation of basic genome statistics such as size, GC content and amino acid usage was done using the CMG biotools (Vesth et al., 2013). These tools were also used for gene finding using prodigalrunner, generation of BLAST atlases comparing the protein-coding open reading frames and for the pan- and core-genome analyses of the studied strains.  Phylogenetic analyses  The 16S rRNA gene sequences used are the publically available sequences originally published for each strain or obtained from the whole genome sequence when other sequence was not available. The gene sequences used for the MLSA (ftsZ, gapA, gyrB, mreB, pyrH, recA, rpoA) and the fur gene sequence, were obtained from the genomes using the CLC Main Workbench (CLC Aarhus, Denmark version 7) (Table S2). An annotation-based search was performed for the gene sequences of interest using the NCBI annotation. The genomes not annotated at NCBI were annotated using RAST (Aziz et al., 2008; Overbeek et al., 2014). The accession numbers for 16S rRNA gene sequences and the gene locus tags are provided in Table S2. The gene topA was not used in the MLSA, since no homologous sequence was found in the genome of P. galatheae S2753. Alignments and Maximum Likelihood Phylogeny trees were done using CLC Main Workbench. Maximum Likelihood Phylogeny trees were constructed using the Neighbor Joining method with the Jukes-Cantor nucleotide distance measure. The topology of the tree was tested with 1,000 bootstrap replications. MEGA 6 was used to finalize the tree design (Tamura et al., 2013).  The Genome-to-Genome Distance Calculator by DSMZ was used to determine in silico DNA-DNA re-association percent values (Auch et al., 2010), and the Average Nucleotide Identity (ANI) calculator to estimate the ANI values (Goris et al., 2007). The nucleotide identity percentages for the fur gene and the MLSA were calculated using the pair-wise comparison tool of CLC Main Workbench.  lux-rib operon  The lux genes were identified by homology search to previously described genes (Ast and Dunlap, 2004; Urbanczyk et al., 2008, 2012) using protein sequence BLAST tools of CLC Main Workbench with identity/query coverage cutoff of 50/50. Identified lux operons were then blasted against whole genome sequences of the studied Photobacterium strains using MultiGeneBLAST (Medema et al., 2013).  Identification of prophages, genomic islands and secondary metabolite clusters  Prophages, genomic islands and secondary metabolite clusters were identified using the online tools PHAST, IslandViewer 3 and antiSMASH 3.0, respectively (Zhou et al., 2011; Dhillon et al., 2015; Weber et al., 2015). The whole genome sequences were submitted to the different tools, and the identified clusters compared using MultiGeneBLAST (Medema et al., 2013).  CRISPR-cas  Genome sequences were analyzed in CRISPRfinder (Grissa et al., 2007) and homology searches for CRISPR associated genes were performed using CLC Main Workbench. Using the CLC Main Workbench BLAST tool, direct repeats and protospacers were compared among each other and to previously identified prophages. Confirmation of cas genes was performed by BLAST comparison of the identified open-reading frames to the NCBI nucleotide database.  Plasmid comparison and virulence genes  We used previously described Photobacterium plasmids to search the genomes for contigs belonging to plasmids using CLC Main Workbench. Plasmids used in the search included: pPHDD1 (FN597600.2), pAQU1 (AB571865.1), pP99-018 (AB277723.1), pP91278 (AB277724.1), pPHDP60 (KC344732.1), pPHDP10 (DQ069059.1), pPHDP70 (KP100338.1), pP9014 (AB453229.1), pPH1 (AY789019.1), pPBPR1 (CR377818.1), and the unnamed plasmid from P. gaetbulicola Gung47 (KC687076.1).  Identification of virulence, histamine production, and transposase genes  The genes hlyA and dly are key virulence genes of P. damselae (Rivas et al., 2011, 2013; Le Roux et al., 2015). Virulence related genes were identified using the BLAST tools of CLC Main Workbench with protein identity/query coverage cutoff of 50/50. Also the genetic basis for histamine production was evaluated, by searching for genes related to histamine production, previously identified in Photobacterium strains (Bjornsdottir-Butler et al., 2016). An annotation based identification of transposase genes was performed in CLC Main Workbench.  Singleton analysis  The number of singletons per genome was calculated using the EDGAR platform for comparative genomics (Blom et al., 2009). A private project has been created by uploading the whole genome sequences of the studied Photobacterium strains and the analysis performed using default settings for singleton identification.

""Some of the contigs of P. damselae subsp. piscicida DI21 also had high similarity to plasmids pPHDP60, pPHDP10 and pPHDP70, which have been previously isolated from this strain""","  Results and discussion  Phylogeny  The 16S rRNA gene phylogeny is widely used in the classification of Photobacterium species and it is sometimes the only phylogenetic discrimination provided when new species are described (Park et al., 2006; Rivas et al., 2006; Gomez-Gil et al., 2011; Liu et al., 2014). However, this gene has low discriminatory power in resolving species relatedness; for instance, P. angustum strains appear scattered throughout the phylogenetic tree, and P. damselae subsp. piscicida DI21 and “P. marinum” AK15 cluster closely to V. pacinii DSM18139 (Figure S1).  The limitations of the use of the 16S rRNA gene as a phylogenetic marker in Vibrionaceae have been previously reported (Sawabe et al., 2007; Machado and Gram, 2015), and the use of Multi-Locus Sequence Analysis (MLSA) has been proposed when evaluating Vibrionaceae phylogenetic relationships (Thompson F. L. et al., 2005; Sawabe et al., 2007, 2013; Pascual et al., 2010; Gabriel et al., 2014). Here, we used several clustering methods to investigate the phylogenetic relationships within the Photobacterium genus. Different approaches (MLSA, fur, amino-acid usage, average nucleotide identity [ANI]) led to distinct phylogenetic results; nevertheless the core phylogenetic groups identified were the same (Figure 2, Figures S2, S3).  Figure 2  Phylogenetic trees. The trees were constructed using seven house-keeping genes (ftsZ, gapA, gyrB, mreB, pyrH, recA, rpoA) (A) and the fur gene (B). The topology of the tree was tested with 1,000 bootstrap replications, and Vibrio pacinii DSM 19139 used to root the tree.  In the MLSA, sequences of seven genes (ftsZ, gapA, gyrB, mreB, pyrH, recA, rpoA) allowed a phylogenetic evaluation using a concatenation length of 7,230 bp. Here, strains belonging to the same species cluster tightly. The same was observed for the recently described identification marker, the ferric up-take regulator (fur) gene (Machado and Gram, 2015). The fur gene has been described as a powerful identification marker in the Vibrionaceae family, however the phylogenetic relationships observed were different from the ones obtained using MLSA and whole genome sequence methods (amino-acid usage and ANI) (Figure 2, Figures S2, S3).  The phylogenetic analysis showed a misidentification of two isolates, P. phosphoreum ANT-2200 and P. damselae subsp. damselae ATCC 33539. Based on our results, P. phosphoreum ANT-2200 should be classified as P. kishitanii, as has previously been suggested (Ast and Dunlap, 2004; Urbanczyk et al., 2011; Bjornsdottir-Butler et al., 2016), and was here confirmed by the phylogenetic assessment and the genomic analyses. The genome identified as belonging to P. damselae subsp. damselae ATCC 33539 was similar to the ones of P. angustum, but the 16S rRNA gene phylogeny using the original sequence placed this strain elsewhere. In fact, partial (FJ971859) and complete (NR_040831) 16S rRNA sequences available for strain ATCC 33539 presented 52 and 68% of query coverage, respectively, with 94 and 96% of identity to the whole genome sequence identified as belonging to P. damselae subsp. damselae ATCC33539. Since no other physiological discrepancies have been previously reported, we believe that the case of P. damselae subsp. damselae ATCC 33539 might be a wrong whole genome sequence submission to NCBI or sequencing of a wrong strain.  This study did not clarify the phylogenetic association of P. damselae as MLSA, fur, ANI, amino-acid usage analyses placed it in different branches, confirming its unstable association (Lucena et al., 2011). In contrast, although the species “P. marinum” has not been recognized, we here show that the type-strain AK15 seems to be indeed the representative of a new species (Srinivas et al., 2013).  In order to provide a quantitative evaluation of the different phylogenetic approaches, in silico DNA-DNA hybridization, fur and MLSA percentage of identity values were calculated and correlated to the ANI. Comparing all the tested phylogenetic methods, resulted in correlation coefficients between 0.84 and 0.95 (Figure S4). Interestingly, the fur gene of approximately 450 bp correlated better with the ANI than the MLSA, which used approximately 6,800 bp more in the analysis. This strengthens the previous suggestion of the use of the fur gene in the classification of Vibrionaceae family strains (Machado and Gram, 2015). We therefore suggest the use of fur analysis in the future classification of new Photobacterium isolates, although MLSA should still be used to evaluate evolutionary relationships.  The division of the Photobacterium genus into two or three clades has been previously suggested (Lucena et al., 2011; Urbanczyk et al., 2011). The most recent review on this genus proposed two clades, based both on the molecular phylogenetic evaluation, but also on the creation of a luminous/symbiotic and a non-luminous/non-symbiotic clusters (Urbanczyk et al., 2011). Our results support the phylogenetic relationship previously observed between the species of each cluster, but the identification of genes responsible for luminescence suggest that P. angustum and P. damselae are not luminescent species as reported before (Urbanczyk et al., 2011; Figure S5). Some strains of P. damselae have acquired lux genes through horizontal gene transfer (HGT) (Urbanczyk et al., 2008), which might explain the absence of these genes in the studied strains. On the other hand, luminescence of P. angustum strains varies (Urbanczyk et al., 2011), but we could not identify lux genes in any of the six P. angustum strains. Furthermore, P. ganghwense has been defined as bioluminescent (Park et al., 2006); however, it has not been described how this feature was evaluated in the original study, nor could we identify lux genes in the genome of the type-strain. Therefore, the generic division of luminous vs. non-luminous clades should be avoided.  Genomic diversity  General genomic features  The Photobacterium genomes ranged in size from 4.2 to 6.4 Mb (Figure 3). The genome size range was in accordance with the ones reported for other genera from the Vibrionaceae family (Thompson et al., 2009). The largest genomes found belonged to P. profundum, which is an extremely versatile species. P. profundum SS9 is able to grow at cold temperatures and in pressurized environments (Eloe et al., 2008; Lauro et al., 2008, 2014). It seems therefore logical that such environmental versatility comes associated with a larger genome size (Konstantinidis and Tiedje, 2004).  Figure 3  Genome size and GC content of the studied genomes. The size is represented in mega-bases (Mb) by the horizontal bars and the percentage of GC by the black dots.  The GC content of the genomes varied between 38.7 and 50.9%, and the strains clustered in two groups based on GC%: one of approximately 40% and another of approximately 50%. The only exceptions were P. swingsii CAIM1393 and Photobacterium sp. AK15, which had a GC content of 43.4 and 46.2%, respectively. The GC content has been linked to a division of strains that also is reflected in their environmental conditions as well as to amino acid usage (Lightfield et al., 2011). Independently of the method used, the species with higher GC content clustered together, suggesting an evolutionary association of GC content and phylogenetic proximity within the genus (Figure 2).  Several theories for genome evolution in bacteria explaining smaller cell size and genomes, the different GC content, the genomic reductions and expansions have been presented and discussed (Moran et al., 2007; Hunt et al., 2008a; Newton et al., 2010; Morris et al., 2012; Fernández-Gómez et al., 2013; Giovannoni et al., 2014; Luo and Moran, 2015). It has, for example, been shown that genome size and GC content are related with the ecological strategies of the different marine bacteria, with free-living bacteria having lower GC content and smaller genomes, as compared to patch-associated bacteria (Luo and Moran, 2015). Also, it is expected that symbionts, parasites and commensals would experience genome reduction due to specialization (Morris et al., 2012; Giovannoni et al., 2014). Here, we observe that the smallest genomes and lower GC content are indeed found in the known symbiotic organisms (P. iliopiscarium, P. damselae, P. phosphoreum), but also in P. galatheae and P. halotolerans. This could be explained by genetic drift and streamlining, respectively (Giovannoni et al., 2014; Luo and Moran, 2015).  The only two closed genomes (P. profundum SS9 and P. gaetbulicola Gung47) have a larger and a smaller chromosome of approximately 4 and 2 Mb, plus megaplasmids of 80 and 35 Kb, respectively. The presence of 2 chromosomes is a trend of the Vibrionaceae family and it is assumed that the draft genomes used also include two chromosomes and large plasmids, but fully closed genomes would be required to assert this. The number of genes per genome was estimated using prodigalrunner and ranged from 4,041 to 7,027.  To visualize the protein-coding gene content conservation in the Photobacterium genus, we constructed a BLAST atlas using P. profundum SS9 and P. gaetbulicola Gung47 as reference genomes (Figure S6). As previously described for other members of the Vibrionaceae family (Thompson et al., 2009), the Photobacterium large chromosome seems to be more conserved between species than the smaller chromosome or plasmids (Figure S6). The smaller chromosomes are highly variable and harbor the main genomic differences between strains of the same species. These secondary chromosomes and plasmids therefore seem to be the source of the genetic plasticity, mirrored in the different phenotypes observed within members of the Photobacterium genus and Vibrionaceae family in general (Vesth et al., 2010; Lukjancenko and Ussery, 2014). A well-studied example is V. splendidus, where the genomes of strains from the same species vary and result in distinct phenotypic capabilities (Thompson J. R. et al., 2005; Hunt et al., 2008a). This diversity is also evident for the Photobacterium species in the several genetic features analyzed, such as virulence, bioluminescence, histamine production, secondary metabolism and CRISPR-Cas operons. All these genomic features presented random distributions rarely correlated with phylogenetic relatedness (Figure 4), raising the issue of species-phenotype association within the Photobacterium genus. Nevertheless, genomic features such as genome size and GC content seem to be associated with different lifestyles adopted by Photobacterium species.  Figure 4  Summary figure of some of the shared genomic traits between the Photobacterium strains. The phylogenetic tree is based on the MLSA phylogenetic distances. Squares represent the lux-rib operon, color-coded for the different gene cluster architectures. Triangles indicate the presence of genes coding for histamine producing proteins. Hexagons indicate the presence of CRISPR-Cas loci, color-coded for the different gene cluster architectures. Inverted triangles indicate the common prophages, each different also color-coded. Circles represent antiSMASH hits: brown for aryl-polyene biosynthetic gene cluster; yellow for ectoine biosynthetic gene cluster; blue for terpene biosynthetic gene cluster; white for polyunsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis gene cluster; and green for NRPS biosynthetic gene clusters.  Bioluminescence for example was initially thought to be a widespread feature of the genus (Urbanczyk et al., 2011). We identified the genetic basis for bioluminescence only in three species P. kishitanii, P. phosphoreum, and P. leiognathi (Figure S5), isolated from different marine animals (Table S1). This also compared with the phylogenetic analysis (Figure 2A), with the exception of P. iliopiscarium, that may have lost this trait due to niche adaptation (Figure 4). Analysis of the lux-rib operon further showed that strains ATCC 25521, ATCC 33979 and Irivu.4.1 are most likely P. leiognathi subsp. leiognathi, according to their lux-rib gene organization (Figure S5) (Ast and Dunlap, 2004). Similarly, histamine production seems to be specific for P. kishitanii and P. damselae, however genes responsible for this feature could be identified also in one P. angustum strain (ATCC 33977) (Figure S7). Scombrotoxin fish poisoning (high levels of histamine) is the most frequent cause of fish poisoning incidents within the United States (Pennotti et al., 2013). Recently, high-histamine producing Photobacterium strains have been isolated from freshly caught fish (Bjornsdottir-Butler et al., 2016), raising awareness for the need to revise food safety rules regarding sea food. There are also several reports describing P. phosphoreum as histamine producing species (Kanki et al., 2004, 2007), but we did not identify the genes responsible for histamine production in P. phosphoreum ATCC 11040, although it may be present in other P. phosphoreum strains.  Pan- and core-genome  The pan-genome refers to the total number of genes in all the 35 strains, while the core genome represents the number of orthologous genes shared between them. Using 35 genomes we identified a pan-genome of 28,951 genes and a core-genome of 1,232 genes (Figure 5). Taking into consideration the average gene number of 4,750 for the Photobacterium strains, 1,232 genes, represents approximately 25% of the total genome, meaning that approximately 1/4 of the genome is conserved in all the strains. The number of core-genome genes is in agreement with what has been found in other marine Gammaproteobacteria (Qin et al., 2013), although this is two times higher than what has been found for the Vibrio genus, where the core-genome comprised approximately 500 genes (Thompson et al., 2009). This difference can be explained by the high number of Vibrio species (more than 120), which reflects the genomic and ecological diversity of the genus.  Figure 5  Pan- and core-genome plot of the 35 Photobacterium strains. The pan- and core-genome calculation was performed using protein sequence BLAST with identity/query coverage cutoff of 50/50. Proteins matching were considered the same gene family. Proteins present in all the tested genomes were considered part of the core-genome.  The pan-genome for the Photobacterium genus alone is greater than what has been reported in a study of the Vibrionaceae family, where 43 genomes of a total of 13 species from three different genera were used (Thompson et al., 2009). This suggests Photobacterium harbors high genomic diversity, reflected in their ability to colonize different environmental niches (Konstantinidis and Tiedje, 2004; Konstantinidis et al., 2009) and supports the theory that high gene content variation exists in environmental marine strains (Tettelin et al., 2008; Konstantinidis et al., 2009). Using a power-law regression, it is possible to evaluate the openness of a pan-genome (Tettelin et al., 2008). The Photobacterium pan-genome is open, with a γ parameter of 0.62 in a power-law regression fitting relatively well the data analyzed (R2 = 0.89) (Figure S8). This genetic variation and uniqueness of each strain is also evident in the number of singletons per strain, which for some strains represent almost 20% of the genes identified in the genome (Table S3).  Plasmids and virulence genes  Most Photobacterium species have been described as symbiotic or associated with other marine organisms (Ast et al., 2007; Dunlap, 2009; Gomez-Gil et al., 2011; Urbanczyk et al., 2011, 2013). Furthermore, some strains of P. damselae are pathogens of marine organisms, especially fish (Hundenborn et al., 2013; Andreoni and Magnani, 2014). The key virulence genes of P. damselae are a phospholipase-D damselysin gene (dly) and a pore-forming toxin gene (hlyA), which act in a synergistic manner (Rivas et al., 2011, 2013; Le Roux et al., 2015). We conducted a homology search to evaluate the possible virulence of other Photobacterium species. The genes could only be identified in P. damselae subsp. damselae CIP 102761. In this strain, two copies of the hlyA gene were identified, one in contig_1, close to an IS4 transposase and a phage integrase and the other in contig_4, next to the dly gene.  Often draft-whole genome sequences contain plasmid sequences. Plasmids are important mediators of several physiological traits of Photobacterium, such as virulence, drug resistance and biosynthetic capabilities (Kim et al., 2008; Rivas et al., 2011; Nonaka et al., 2012; Osorio et al., 2015). We compared known Photobacterium plasmids to the here studied genomes. Plasmid pPHDD1 showed high similarity to contig_4 of P. damselae subsp. damselae CIP 102761 genome. Some of the contigs of P. damselae subsp. piscicida DI21 also had high similarity to plasmids pPHDP60, pPHDP10 and pPHDP70, which have been previously isolated from this strain (Osorio et al., 2008, 2015).  Evidence of horizontal gene transfer (HGT)  The genetic exchange of foreign DNA by means of transposable elements, phage infection or conjugative plasmids has been suggested as a driving force in the evolution of members of Vibrionaceae (Reen et al., 2006; Vitulo et al., 2007; Gu et al., 2009; Lilburn et al., 2010; Urbanczyk et al., 2011). HGT can occur by uptake of environmental DNA, conjugative plasmids and bacteriophage infection. In the Photobacterium genus, studies on HGT are limited to the lux-rib operon, and a chitinase A and deoxyribodipyrimidine photolyase genes (Urbanczyk et al., 2008, 2012; Hunt et al., 2008b; Lauro et al., 2014) Here, we searched for evidence of genomic exchange by identifying prophages, transposases, CRISPR-Cas systems, genomic islands and secondary metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters.  Genomic islands and transposases  Using Island Viewer (Dhillon et al., 2015), we searched for genomic islands in the fully sequenced genomes of P. profundum SS9 and P. gaetbulicola Gung47, and compared these to genomes of other strains from the same species (Figure 6). Some of the major genetic differences between the strains of the same species seem indeed to be related to the presence or absence of specific genomic islands. Genomic regions only present in the reference strain are placed close to identified genomic islands.  Figure 6  Identification of genomic islands in the fully sequenced genomes of P. profundum SS9 and of P. gaetbulicola Gung47. The genomes of the mentioned strains are compared to the genome of another strain of the same species, P. profundum 3CTK and P. gaetbulicola AD005, respectively. The circle inside the BLAST atlas shows the Island Viewer results (integrated results in red, SIGI-HMM in orange and IslandPath-DIMOB in blue).  Additionally, strains varied in their number of transposase genes (Table S3). While P. profundum SS9 had 219 transposase genes, P. leioghnathi subsp. mandapamensis svers.1.1. had none. No correlation between number of prophages and number of transposase genes was observed. A high number of transposase genes could indicate transposon-mediated exchange of genetic material from any source (both plasmid-borne and random environmental DNA). P. profundum SS9 and Photobacterium sp. SKA34 are cases where transposase genes represent almost 4% of the total genes in the genome (Table S3). This is in accordance with metagenomics data that showed that transposase coding genes are the most abundant genes in nature, most likely accelerating biological diversification and evolution (Aziz et al., 2010) and that a higher number of transposase genes is present in higher oceanic depths (Konstantinidis et al., 2009).  Prophages and CRISPR-Cas systems  Using the PHAge Search Tool (PHAST) (Zhou et al., 2011) we identified 33 intact prophage sequences and 72 incomplete ones (Table S3). From the 33 intact ones, 17 were unique, while the other 16 were re-occurrences of three prophages. One was present only in P. profundum strains; another in all P. kishitanii strains, plus one P. damselae and one P. angustum; and the third was randomly distributed (Figure 4).  The bacterial and archaeal adaptive immune systems entail CRISPR-Cas modules (Makarova et al., 2015) and we queried the genomes for the architecture of the CRISPR-Cas systems including the cas gene organization, the direct repeats (DR) and the protospacers in the CRISPR locus. We divided the architecture of the CRISPR-Cas systems into seven clusters (Figure 7). Most of the architectures identified were similar to the ones described in Yersinia pestis, Escherichia coli and Desulfovibrio vulgaris (Figures 7A–C; Haft et al., 2005). Also, we identified two clusters in P. profundum SS9 similar to the ones of Y. pestis and E. coli, encoded in the chromosome and plasmid, respectively (Figures 7D,E). These clusters had different gene arrangement and/or included genes coding for unknown proteins in the operon. Two other clusters containing CRISPR-associated genes were identified (Figures 7F,G).  Figure 7  Different CRISPR/Cas subtypes identified across the Photobacterium genomes. CRIPR/Cas similar to Yersinia pestis  (A), Escherichia coli  (B) and Desulfovibrio vulgaris  (C), and other gene organizations (D–G). The numbers in brackets correspond to the number of protospacers identified in that region.  The estimation of DRs and protospacers in the CRISPR arrays is very difficult in draft genomes due to the short sequencing reads and the repetitive nature of the sequences, which make them difficult to assemble correctly. In most of the cases, both direct repeats and protospacers could be identified both upstream and downstream of the cas-operon. These were also identified elsewhere in the genome or in distinct contigs, usually consisting of one of the ends of the contig. For example, further upstream from the Tn7 in the P. galatheae S2753 (Figure 7G), an array of 16 protospacers could be identified beside a gene coding for a DNA nicking enzyme.  The DRs that flanked the protospacers were extracted and compared. The similarity of the DRs correlated with the type of clusters the strain had. DRs from clusters (a) and (d) were similar, as were the ones within (b) and (f). The protospacers are short sequences that are derived from bacteriophages or other foreign DNA, such as conjugative plasmids (Attar, 2015; Makarova et al., 2015). Therefore, these sequences may provide a history of encounters of a specific bacterium with phages and/or plasmids. The number of spacers varied considerable between different strains, from 1 to 64 protospacers in the same CRISPR array. Arrays with extensive number of protospacers in some strains indicate numerous bacteriophage infections, which is the case of e.g., P. profundum SS9, P. angustum S14 and P. aquae CGMCC 1.12159 with 64, 45, and 33 protospacers, respectively (Figure 7). The 4 spacers in P. leiognathi lrivu.4.1 were 100% identical to the first 4 spacers in P. angustum S14, which had an array of 45 spacers. Also high similarity (>93% Identity) could be identified in the first spacers of P. angustum ATCC 25915, ATCC 33975 and P. damselae subsp. damselae ATCC 33539 (which should be classified as P. angustum), although for the P. angustum strains the protospacers have not just been identified downstream of the cas operon, but elsewhere.  We have also compared the protospacers to the prophage sequences identified in these genomes. The bacterial immune system (CRISPR-Cas) allows the protection against re-infection by the same bacteriophage (Attar, 2015), nevertheless, for P. angustum ATCC 33975 an array of 9 sequential spacers were 100% identical to an intact prophage sequence identified within the same genome, suggesting multiple re-infection events.  Phage infection seems to be a frequent event in some strains, supported by the extensive number of protospacers in the CRISPR arrays and the number of prophages within the genomes (Figure 7). Remarkably, the cas operons previously associated with E. coli, D. vulgaris and Y. pestis were identified in Photobacterium strains (Haft et al., 2005). Yet, presence/absence and type of cluster seems randomly spread across the different species (Figure 4).  Secondary metabolism  Another indication of high genomic exchange is the number and distribution of secondary metabolism biosynthetic clusters, many of which are believed to be acquired by HGT (Khaldi et al., 2008). Secondary metabolites such as non-ribosomal peptides and polyketides are known to have antagonistic properties, which may constitute an advantage in several ecological niches. Although Photobacterium strains have mostly been studied due to their association with marine animals, their potential in drug discovery and other applications has recently been reported (Wietz et al., 2010b; Machado et al., 2014, 2015a,b; Nielsen et al., 2014; Mathew et al., 2015a,b).  Using antiSMASH 3.0 (Weber et al., 2015), different biosynthetic gene clusters were identified (Table S4) with some clusters being present across the genus and others being species specific (Figure 4). The same terpene biosynthetic cluster could be identified in all the P. angustum strains (including the misidentified P. damselae subsp. damselae ATCC 33539). The function of this terpene cluster is not known, but it may be related to the planktonic lifestyle of this species, since all the P. angustum strains were isolated from seawater. Another species-specific cluster was the polyunsaturated fatty-acid (PUFA) cluster present in P. profundum strains. This cluster could be involved in the high pressure and cold temperature adaptation of this species, since these PUFAs are known to modify membrane fluidity in response to hydrostatic pressure and temperature (Campanaro et al., 2005).  Other biosynthetic clusters such as siderophore, aryl-polyene and ectoine were widely distributed across the genus (Figure 4). A siderophore cluster was present in 11 strains, although two distinct siderophore biosynthetic clusters were identified. The ectoine cluster was present in 18 strains (two had only two out of three genes needed for its biosynthesis). The most widely distributed cluster was the aryl-polyene biosynthetic cluster, identified in 23 out of the 35 strains. Interestingly strains associated with marine animals did not have a siderophore cluster nor were they prolific in other secondary metabolite clusters (Figure 4, Figure S4). Strains isolated from seawater or sediments seem to be enriched in secondary metabolite clusters, when compared to marine animal associated species. These strains have therefore the genetic capability of possibly antagonizing microbial competitors in their environment.  The distribution of secondary metabolite clusters suggests events of gain and loss of these clusters throughout the evolution of Photobacterium species. The random presence of specific traits, i.e., not phylogenetically related, has been reported for other genus. For example, in Pseudovibrio the random distribution of type IV secretion systems was attributed to the frequency with which those genes are horizontally acquired (Cascales and Christie, 2003; Romano et al., 2016). In fact, several of the interesting phenotypic traits identified in Photobacterium strains, such as bioluminescence, virulence, histamine production and piezophilia seem to be acquired by HGT (Ast and Dunlap, 2004; Campanaro et al., 2005; Dunlap, 2009; Urbanczyk et al., 2011; Hundenborn et al., 2013; Andreoni and Magnani, 2014; Osorio et al., 2015; Bjornsdottir-Butler et al., 2016).

Our new phylogeny of USA300/USA500 will be a reference point for understanding the genetic adaptations that have allowed multiple highly virulent clonal strains to emerge from within CC8 over the past 50 years.  ABSTRACT  USA500 isolates are clonal complex 8 (CC8) Staphylococcus aureus strains closely related to the prominent community- and hospital-associated USA300 group. Despite being relatively understudied, USA500 strains cause a significant burden of disease and are the third most common methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) strains identified in the U.S. Emerging Infections Program (EIP) invasive S. aureus surveillance. To better understand the genetic relationships of the strains, we sequenced the genomes of 539 USA500 MRSA isolates from sterile site infections collected through the EIP between 2005 and 2013 in the United States. USA500 isolates fell into three major clades principally separated by their distribution across different U.S. regions. Clade C1 strains, found principally in the Northeast, were associated with multiple IS256 insertion elements in their genomes and higher levels of antibiotic resistance. C2 was associated with Southern states, and E1 was associated with Western states. C1 and C2 strains all shared a frameshift in the gene encoding AdsA surface-attached surface protein. We propose that the term “USA500” should be used for CC8 strains sharing a recent common ancestor with the C1, C2, and E1 strains but not in the USA300 group.  IMPORTANCE In this work, we have removed some of the confusion surrounding the use of the name “USA500,” placed USA500 strains in the context of the CC8 group, and developed a strategy for assignment to subclades based on genome sequence.

PMC5932375,DISCUSSION,Results and Discussion,CP000046,0,0,0,,,"  DISCUSSION  It is important to establish a consistent use of the name “USA500” that can be used for future epidemiological studies and comparisons. The terms “USA500” and “USA300” are derived from a PFGE typing scheme established in early 2000s (33) and represent different lineages within a single clonal complex (CC8) that acquired SCCmec type IV cassettes and increased in incidence in the human population. In essence, three definitions of the USA500 strain have been used in the literature, as described below: (i) USA500 PFGE type, (ii) USA500 sensu stricto as a single clade within CC8, and (iii) USA500 sensu lato as the genetic background to USA300 (e.g., as proposed by Glaser et al. [2]).  (i) USA500 PFGE type.  USA500 is the original designation associated with MRSA strain types in the United States, based on PFGE (1). However, PFGE will be performed less frequently on future isolates as clinical genome sequencing becomes more routine (34). We also showed that PFGE (before 2012) and the algorithm (after 2012) for inferring USA500 from “Iberian” PFGE using MLST or spa and sea/seb PCR was only 82% accurate in distinguishing USA500 and Iberian USA500 pulse types (Fig. 1; Table 1).  (ii) USA500 sensu stricto as a single clade within CC8.  If USA500 was represented a single clade, the primary candidates would be C1 and C2 or E1. Strain 2395 (C1) has been the reference genome for USA500 since the publication by Benson et al. (15). This strain was assumed to be representative of a unitary USA500 clade in the recent genomic analysis of CC8 by Strauß et al. (34), which led the authors to conclude that USA500 was not a direct ancestor of USA300. Alternatively, the marker-based typing scheme proposed by Li et al. designated the E1 clade as USA500 (11) (Fig. 1; Table 1). Designation of one or the other of these clades as the sole USA500 clade would have the advantage of casting USA500 as a true monophyletic clade. The problem is that any sensu stricto definition excludes many other strains that are commonly referred to in the literature as USA500.  (iii) USA500 sensu lato as the genetic background to USA300.  As proposed by Glaser et al. (2), USA500 sensu lato could be considered the genetic background to USA300. All CC8 non-USA300 strains that derive from an ancestor that contained a signature cap5D A nucleotide insertion at position 994 in the gene (5) could be considered USA500. Based on this definition, the CC8 sublineages C, D, and E (20) would all be considered USA500 (Fig. 1). We believe the “sensu lato” definition has the advantages of being simple and inclusive. One consequence of using this definition is that it would sequester some strains not previously considered USA500, including the recently described epidemic Russian clone OC8 (35) (Fig. 1). The clade containing all descendants of the common ancestor of USA300 and USA500 isolates (subgroups C to F) would be called USA300/USA500 (sensu lato).  The whole-genome phylogeny and molecular clock analysis revealed that the three major USA500 clades collected by the EIP had undergone population expansions in the United States from around the middle of the 20th century. USA300 emerged from the F sublineage and spread within the United States and internationally (36) rather than remaining regionally concentrated, as the USA500 clades did. Including the recent Russian OC8 strain (35), we now know there have been at least five significant expansions of virulent strains carrying SCCmec type IV cassettes from within the CC8 clonal complex (USA300, OC8, and the 3 USA500 clades). CC8 was also the origin of the first MRSA strains with the type I SCCmec cassette (ST250) in the early 1960s (37, 38). It has been suggested that the CC8 background in general and USA500/USA300 in particular have intrinsic high virulence potential (39, 40). Li et al. showed that USA300 strains and USA500 (clade E1) strain BD02-25 had greater virulence in a bacteremic mouse model than other CC8 strains and enhanced resistance to human antimicrobial peptides (12). Benson et al. also demonstrated the unusually high toxin levels of the C1 strain 2395 (18).  Each of the five expansions within CC8 (USA300, OC8, C1, C2, and E1) may have been the result of either specific genetic adaptations or chance events or a combination of both. Interestingly, there are parallels in the types of genetic changes acquired by each strain expansion and also unique differences. Antibiotic resistance may have played a role in the expansion of the C1 clade in particular (Fig. 4). Fluoroquinolone resistance, as an example, likely evolved in parallel on at least 4 occasions by the strains that form part of the study. There must have been particular selection pressure for survival of the effects of this class of antibiotics (possibly administered to treat other infections), and the mutations probably have low fitness cost, allowing them to persist in the population even in the absence of an antibiotic selective pressure. It has been suggested that the propensity for secretion of fluoroquinolones onto the skin through sweat may lead to high enough drug concentrations to effect selection (41).  In the case of OC8 and C1, parallel acquisition of IS256 seemed to be associated with expansion (18, 35). An IS256 element in strain 2395 (clade C1) disrupted the rot (repressor of toxicity) locus and increased toxin production (18). C1 strains containing IS256 were found to be more cytotoxic for human neutrophils (18, 42) and also exhibited greater virulence for mice in a systemic infection model (43). The OC8 strain had 19 IS256 copies, two of which, in inverted orientation, facilitated a 1-Mb genomic inversion in the main chromosome (35). IS256 is a catalyst for expansion in diverse S. aureus lineages and may affect numerous other phenotypes—for example, vancomycin resistance (44). IS256 transposition activity is enhanced by antibiotic concentration, which may be a clue in understanding the recent spread of the element in S. aureus and other pathogens (45–47). We surveyed a database of 3,755 published S. aureus Illumina genome assemblies for the IS256 transposase, finding identical or nearly identical (a maximum 2-nucleotide [nt] difference) sequences in a number of recent clonally expanding genotypes. These included 41/41 ST772 strains, an emerging Indian strain, CA-MRSA (48), and 50/50 ST239, a worldwide HA-MRSA clone contained IS256. IS256 was common (37/262 strains) in ST398, associated with human/livestock transmission (49). No USA300 strain contained IS256. The fact that very similar IS256 elements can move between S. aureus clonal complexes is fascinating given the known genetic barriers to transfer (50, 51). Genes with 100% nucleotide identity to the USA500 IS256 transposase gene were also found by BLAST in other bacterial species. These species included Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Staphylococcus pseudintermedius, Staphylococcus warneri, Staphylococcus capitis, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus durans, Clostridiales bacterium, Clostridium difficile, Mycoplasma mycoides, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli. This suggested IS256 is part of a recent genetic exchange community (26) that encompassed diverse genetic groups within S. aureus as well as several other pathogen species.  For USA300, the mobile ACME (or COMER) elements, speG, and PVL toxins were likely important for its success in community-associated infection (40). The E1 USA500 clade is most closely related to USA300 and may share some of its yet not fully understood adaptations that promote enhanced expression of extracellular toxins and increased transmission rate. The C subgroup had a synapomorphic frameshift mutation in the adsA gene encoding the core (52) surface protein. Previous studies have shown that AdsA is required for full virulence in mouse bacteremia models. A possible explanation invoking pathoadaptation is that the adsA functions to reduce inflammation when S. aureus is on the skin by promoting production of adenosine, a purine nucleotide and antagonist (53). Inflammation may contribute to more frequent transmission and spread of the bacteria by causing rashes and skin damage. The finding that the disrupted adsA gene is common in clinical USA500 MRSA isolates from the United States may also be significant in the future given that the encoded surface protein is a potential vaccine target (54).  In conclusion, whole-genome sequencing has resolved the conundrum of USA500 nomenclature and unveiled possibly important genetic changes (SNPs and horizontal acquisition of genes) that played a role in evolution of pathogenic CC8 MRSA by promoting virulence and/or transmission. These mutations can be used for subtyping CC8 strains using PCR or genome-based types. Functional studies are needed now to disentangle which mutations enhance the success of community and hospital pathogens and which are just random evolutionary noise.

PMC5932375,INTRODUCTION,Introduction,CP000046,1,0,0,,"""Here we aimed to investigate the diversity of USA500 isolates causing invasive infections in the United States through analysis of a large set of strains collected through EIP surveillance""","  INTRODUCTION  The name “USA500” is used to describe a group of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) clones that have emerged over the past 20 years as frequent causes of community-associated (CA) and health-care-associated infections in North America. USA500 was first defined as a distinct pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) type (1). Like the better known USA300 PFGE type, which has caused an epidemic of community-acquired infections in the United States (2, 3), USA500 strains mostly have the multilocus sequence type (MLST) ST8 genotype and are part of the CC8 clonal complex (4). Both USA300 and USA500 carry the type IV SCCmec cassette conferring resistance to β-lactam antibiotics and have conserved mutations in their capsule locus (5). USA300 strains are distinguished from USA500 by having Panton-Valentin leukocidin (PVL) toxin genes within a prophage of the phiSA2 family (6). Isolates of the North American epidemic (NAE) USA300 lineage have an arginine catabolic mobile element (ACME) cassette next to SCCmec, whereas those of the South American epidemic (SAE) lineage have a copper and mercury resistance (COMER) element at same locus (7). USA300 strains also have a SaPI5 pathogenicity island containing sek and seq enterotoxin genes (8). The arginine deiminase (arc) and polyamine resistance (speG) genes on the ACME cassette and the PVL toxin have been proposed as key determinants of the enhanced ability to cause skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) and transmissibility of USA300 (3, 9), although strains with deletions in these genes have been frequently reported (2, 10, 11).  It has been postulated that USA300 evolved as a clonal lineage from within a background of USA500 strains (2, 12). However, genome sequencing studies suggested the relationship was more complex, with USA500 strains assigned to different clades within CC8 (2, 3, 5, 13). Nomenclature for USA500 strains is also complicated. USA500 strains collected at the CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) were subdivided into two groups based on closely related PFGE types: true “USA500” and “Iberian.” Before 2012, the assignment was based largely on PFGE. From 2012 onward, an algorithm for inferring USA500 and Iberian was implemented (https://www.cdc.gov/HAI/settings/lab/CCalgorithm.html), which combined PFGE, spa, MLST, and PCR amplicon-based detection of key horizontally acquired staphylococcal enterotoxin A (sea) and B (seb) genes (12). Confusingly, the term “Iberian” was also earlier used to describe a PFGE type from an MRSA epidemic in Spain and other countries between 1990 and 1995 that was found to be ST247 (CC8) with SCCmec type Ia (14–16).  The CDC’s Emerging Infections Program (EIP) conducts active, laboratory- and population-based surveillance for invasive MRSA infections (17). Strains typed as USA500/Iberian have represented a significant proportion of EIP MRSA isolates. In 2013 (the final year in which we drew collected strains for sequencing in this study), they constituted 13.5% of health care-associated MRSA (HA-MRSA) strains collected at 5 surveillance sites (https://www.cdc.gov/abcs/reports-findings/surv-reports.html). Notably, in Georgia the incidence was higher than other sites, with USA500/Iberian representing 20% of all HA-MRSA infections over the period from 2012 through 2015 (R. Overton, personal communication). While numerous projects have investigated USA300 evolution through comparative genomics (2, 3, 10, 11, 13), fewer genomic studies have been performed on USA500. Here we aimed to investigate the diversity of USA500 isolates causing invasive infections in the United States through analysis of a large set of strains collected through EIP surveillance. The goal of this work was to arrive at a genetic definition of USA500 that can be used for future typing efforts and to understand its relationship to USA300.  ",FALSE,TRUE,

Invasive MRSA isolates were collected from California (CA), Colorado (CO), Connecticut (CT), Georgia (GA), Maryland (MD), Minnesota (MN), New York (NY), Oregon (OR), and Tennessee (TN) as part of the Emerging Infections Program (EIP) of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as previously described (55). All isolates were characterized at the CDC by SCCmec typing, detection of staphylococcal toxins, antimicrobial susceptibility testing, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) typing, and PCR typing as previously described (1, 55). PFGE was only performed from 2005 to 2008; from 2009 to 2011, an algorithm (https://www.cdc.gov/HAI/settings/lab/inferred-PFGE-algorithm.html) was used to infer PFGE type, and then between 2012 and 2013, a second algorithm incorporating spa typing was used (https://www.cdc.gov/HAI/settings/lab/CCalgorithm.html). From 758 strains classified as USA500/Iberian, 549 strains were chosen for whole-genome sequencing based on maximizing geographic and genetic diversity, based on metadata collected at the time of isolation. We used all the isolates from states other than Georgia, which had the majority of isolates. Strains from Georgia were randomly down-sampled using the criterion that all sampling years, hospitals, and unique PFGE patterns would be represented in the set selected for sequencing. The number of isolates chosen from each year varied between a high of 74 (2005) to a low of 49 (2013) (see Fig. S6 in the supplemental material).  10.1128/mSphere.00571-17.6  FIG S6   Number of strains sequenced each year (2005 to 2013).

DNA isolation.  MRSA was grown overnight at 35°C on Trypticase soy agar with 5% sheep’s blood (BAP) (Becton, Dickinson and Company, Sparks, MD). Bacterial colonies from the third and fourth quadrants of the BAP were transferred into 1.5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) with 0.02% Tween (PBST) and centrifuged at 13,200 × g for 2 min at room temperature. Cells were resuspended in 1.5 ml of PBST and centrifuged at 13,200 × g for 2 min at room temperature two more times and resuspended in 1.5 ml PBST. Nine hundred microliters of each sample was transferred into a Lysing Matrix E tube (MP Biochemicals), vortexed for 3 min, and then centrifuged at 5,000 × g for 1 min, and 200 µl was transferred into an SEV cartridge (MP Biochemicals) and processed per the manufacturer’s instructions on the Maxwell 16 or Maxwell 16 MDx instrument (Promega).  Whole-genome shotgun sequencing.  Libraries constructed using whole-genome DNA preparations were sequenced using an Illumina HiSeq 2500 instrument. Raw read data were deposited in the NCBI Short Read Archive under project accession no. PRJNA316461. The median sequence coverage for each genome was 89-fold with a median per base Q score of 37. One strain was excluded due to library failure.  Genome assembly and annotation.  Strains were assembled de novo using SPAdes v3.7.1 (56) and annotated using PROKKA v1.11 (57). FASTQ sequencing output files from strains with more than 100× coverage were down-sampled using a custom script (https://gist.github.com/rpetit3/9c623454758c9885bf81d269e3453b76) based on the seqtk toolkit (https://github.com/lh3/seqtk). Antibiotic resistance phenotypes were predicted for each strain based on the methods of Gordon et al. (58). Roary (59) was used to estimate a pan-genome from de novo-assembled contigs of the strains sequenced in the study. The MLST was ascertained using SRST2 (60). Two strains were excluded because pangenome content suggested they were not S. aureus, and 8 strains fell outside CC8 based on MLST patterns.  BLAST comparisons to assembled genome sequences.  Blast+ v2.2.28 was used for alignments. For short nucleotide sequences (<31 nt), we used the blastn with the “blastn-short” task and called matches with a greater than 90% identity and an alignment length of at least 15. For alignment of protein sequences, we used the tblastn program and called matches with at least 97% identity. For most larger nucleotide alignments, we used blastn with the megablast task and called matches with greater than 97% identity. For antibiotic resistance genes, we followed the guidelines of Gordin et al. (58) and used blastn with a word size parameter of 17, gapopen of 5, and gapextend of 2 and saved matches where the identity multiple by the ratio of the hit to the total length of the gene was greater than 0.8 (or 0.3 in the case of the blaZ, fusB, and far genes).  IS256 insertion sites.  All strains found to contain IS256 were processed using ISMapper v1.2 (29) to determine the transposon insertion sites. ISMapper used the paired-end FASTQ files of reads for each genome, the reference genome assembly (USA500-2395; accession no. CP007499.1) (18) and an IS256 query sequence (accession no. NC_013321.1) (33).  Phylogenetic tree estimation.  A whole-genome alignment of de novo-assembled contigs from 539 CC8 strains from this study and 24 CC8 strains described in other papers was processed using Parsnp (61). The alignment length was 2,361,133 bp. Potential recombination sites were identified using ClonalFrameML (24) based on a maximum likelihood (ML) guide tree constructed by PhyML (62, 63), removed using a custom R script, leaving a final alignment of 2,359,393 bp with 18,755 variable sites (SNPs). The alignment file, R script, and ClonalFrameML output listing recombinant sites have been made publicly available on FigShare (https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.5915257.v1). We performed ML tree estimation on the 2,359,393-bp alignment with 1,000 bootstraps using RAxML version 8.2.11 (63) with a GTRGAMMA model and one partition. The resulting phylogenetic trees were visualized with the Interactive Tree of Life (iTOL) web service (64). We chose ST250 COL (accession no. CP000046.1 [13]) as the outgroup, as it was the earliest branching strain in subgroups A to F when we included a more divergent ST630 in a pilot phylogeny. One strain in group F, CT-172, was pruned from the final tree because of a long branch. Visual inspection using the gingr tool (61) revealed the presence of a likely large recombinant region in this strain between 2.47 and 2.59 Mbp on the USA500-2395 reference coordinates that had not been detected by ClonalFrameML.  Statistical tests of metadata.  Seven metadata categories for each sample were provided: state, hospital identification, year of collection, culture source, patient age, in-hospital patient mortality (deceased, alive, and unknown) and sample class (HACO, CO, HA, and CA). A case was classified as HO if the MRSA culture was obtained on or after the fourth calendar day of hospitalization (where admission was hospital day 1). A case was classified as HACO if the culture was obtained in an outpatient setting or before the fourth calendar day of hospitalization and had one or more of the following: (i) a history of hospitalization, surgery, dialysis, or residence in a long-term-care facility in the previous year, or (ii) the presence of a central vascular catheter (CVC) within 2 days prior to MRSA culture. Finally, a case was classified as community-associated (CA) if none of the previously mentioned criteria were met. To test the significance of these categories on which clade the sample belongs to, we ran a permutation test on each category, and adjusted the output P values with a Bonferroni correction. Tests were implemented using the Independence Test from the coin R package (65) and p.adjust from the base statistics R package.  Molecular dating analysis.  We used BEAST 2.4.5 (23) to conduct the molecular dating analysis, incorporating a coalescent Bayesian skyline demographic model with 5 groups. We picked up to 5 isolates from each sampling year for each of the clades C1, C2, and E1. Where there were more than 5 strains in a clade for a given year, we randomly selected 5 using the R sample function. We picked all dated samples from sublineage F in Fig. 1 and representatives of ST247, ST250, and sublineages B and D as outgroups. COL (ST250) was set as the root of the tree as in the phylogenetic analysis described above. In total, 151 samples were used. We experimented with different subsampling strategies before selecting 130,000 randomly picked sites. We found larger data configurations (more isolates and/or more sites) did not reach effective sample sizes (ESSs) of >200 for many parameters even after 300,000,000 generations. We used a GTR+R substitution model with the correction for among-site variation. We obtained good estimates of the posterior distribution of the parameters in this analysis, as these parameters reached over 200 ESSs. We set an uncorrelated log-normal relaxed clock and calibrated the clock using the dates of collection of the isolates. The final analysis was run for 200,000,000 generations, sampling every 20,000 generations and discarding the first 20,000,000 generations as burn-in. We evaluated the convergence of the analysis by checking that all the parameters reached ESS values of >200 and by analyzing the trace plots of the likelihood scores. Furthermore, we ran the final analysis twice so as to check that the analysis was converging and the two runs reached very similar results (see Table S2 and Fig. S7 in the supplemental material). To test whether the subsampling strategy accurately reproduced variation in the data, given that we only used a subset of the sites, we created another 3 replicates (randomly subsampling the same number of sites), and molecular dating analyses were run on each replicate. We obtained similar results across all the replicates (see Fig. S8 in the supplemental material). Tajima’s D values for clades were calculated using VariScan (66).  10.1128/mSphere.00571-17.7  FIG S7   Convergence of molecular clock analyses.

We used the VCF format output of the whole-genome alignment to identify 31-mers unique to each major USA500 clade and USA300. Using Jellyfish (67), samples were queried for a nonzero count of each 31-mer from this list. Assignment of a strain to a clade was based on the presence of a strain-specific 31-mer from only one clade and the absence of 31-mers from other clades. We also extracted 31-mers associated with canonical SNPs defined by Bowers et al. (20) and used these to assign strains to sublineages A to F.  FIG 1   Maximum likelihood phylogeny of USA500 and other CC8 strains. The COL reference genome (68) was an outgroup. The major clades are color coded: F, green; E1, gray; D, purple; C1, dark blue; C2, blue; BA, brick red. The reference genome was strain 2395 in the C1 clade. The likelihood score for the tree was −3,374,456. (a) Circular view with locations of representative strains from each clade indicated in the text. Small black squares on the tree indicate branches supported by fewer than 90% bootstrap replicates. Outer ring 1 shows the results of inferred PFGE typing by PCR. Black indicates Iberian, gray indicates USA500, and white indicates other result or not done. The second ring is colored by U.S. state of origin: red, California; purple, Colorado; dark blue, Connecticut; light blue, Georgia; dark purple, Maryland; orange, Minnesota; yellow, New York; magenta, Oregon; green, Tennessee. The third ring (red squares) shows presence of an SaPI3/5-like site-specific integrase gene. The fourth ring (green squares) shows the presence of at least one copy of IS256 in the genome. Only results from strains sequenced in this study are shown on the outer rings. The figure was created by iTOL (64). The tree with full metadata is publicly available at http://itol.embl.de/tree/1701401041445011519064958. Panel b is the same tree as panel a but with all multistrain clades collapsed. The internal node that is the common ancestor of all USA500/USA300 isolates is marked with an asterisk. The percentage of bootstrap support is shown for each of the branches.

PMC5932375,RESULTS,Results and Discussion,CP000046,0,0,0,,,"  RESULTS  CC8 strains typed as “USA500/Iberian” fall into three major clades.  De novo-assembled contigs of the 539 strains typed as MRSA USA500, along with data from 24 published CC8 strains (listed with citations in Table S1 in the supplemental material), were aligned against the reference genome of strain 2395 (2,995,646 bp with a large plasmid [pUSA500] of 32,406 bp) (18). The 2395 strain, recovered from a wound infection in New York (18, 19), was originally assigned to the “Iberian” subgroup of USA500 based on the presence of the sea and seb genes. The whole-genome alignment of all 539 CC8 strains sequenced in this study plus 24 published genomes had a core region of 1,995 kbp (67.5% of the 2,956-kbp chromosome). Regions not part of the core alignment on the chromosome included prophages, pathogenicity islands, transposons, and other repeat sequences. Plasmid content was variable between strains and therefore excluded from consideration in the phylogenetic reconstruction. After recombinant regions were identified and removed, the final alignment consisting of 13,765 chromosomal single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) was used to estimate a maximum likelihood tree (Fig. 1). We labeled the CC8 sublineages A to F using a scheme developed recently (20) (Fig. 1).  10.1128/mSphere.00571-17.9  TABLE S1   Samples included from external studies.

FIG 1   Maximum likelihood phylogeny of USA500 and other CC8 strains. The COL reference genome (68) was an outgroup. The major clades are color coded: F, green; E1, gray; D, purple; C1, dark blue; C2, blue; BA, brick red. The reference genome was strain 2395 in the C1 clade. The likelihood score for the tree was −3,374,456. (a) Circular view with locations of representative strains from each clade indicated in the text. Small black squares on the tree indicate branches supported by fewer than 90% bootstrap replicates. Outer ring 1 shows the results of inferred PFGE typing by PCR. Black indicates Iberian, gray indicates USA500, and white indicates other result or not done. The second ring is colored by U.S. state of origin: red, California; purple, Colorado; dark blue, Connecticut; light blue, Georgia; dark purple, Maryland; orange, Minnesota; yellow, New York; magenta, Oregon; green, Tennessee. The third ring (red squares) shows presence of an SaPI3/5-like site-specific integrase gene. The fourth ring (green squares) shows the presence of at least one copy of IS256 in the genome. Only results from strains sequenced in this study are shown on the outer rings. The figure was created by iTOL (64). The tree with full metadata is publicly available at http://itol.embl.de/tree/1701401041445011519064958. Panel b is the same tree as panel a but with all multistrain clades collapsed. The internal node that is the common ancestor of all USA500/USA300 isolates is marked with an asterisk. The percentage of bootstrap support is shown for each of the branches. This tree is publicly available at http://itol.embl.de/tree/17014010416011519065058.  The phylogeny revealed that the majority of USA500/Iberian strains were in three major and discrete clades within CC8. Two of the USA500 clades were in the C sublineage and were designated C1 and C2. The other was in the E sublineage and was designated E1. Nineteen strains were placed outside these three clades: in USA300 (sublineage F), sublineage B, or deep-branching sublineages E and C (Fig. 1).  Metadata for each strain included patient age, epidemiological classification of infection (community-associated [CA], health care onset [HO], health care-associated community onset [HACO], or unknown), culture source (blood, cerebrospinal fluid [CSF], bone, etc.), outcome (lived, died, or unknown), and U.S. state of isolation. Using a permutation test, the three major USA500 clades defined here (C1, C2, and E1) were found to have a significantly nonrandom distribution in only the U.S. state of isolation metadata variable (P value of 9.7e−12), reflecting the geographical structuring of the USA500 clades.  The C1 clade (64 strains from this study) contained the strain 2395 USA500 isolate that was used as the reference genome sequence for this study (18). The majority (52/64 [81%]) of samples were from Maryland, Connecticut, or New York. Most C1 strains were ST8, with minority populations of ST609 and ST1508. The C2 clade corresponded to the group labeled as “USA500-like” by Jamrozy et al. (13). These strains were predominantly from Georgia and Tennessee (351/378). One strain was typed as ST476, and the rest were ST8. E1 clade strains were predominantly isolated in California, Colorado, Minnesota, and Oregon (63/78 [81%]). This clade contained the BD02-25 strain originally used as the USA500 reference isolate (12). Of these, 36/78 (46%) were ST2253 and the rest were ST8. Two strains closely related to USA300 contained the S. aureus pathogenicity island (SaPI5) with USA300-like seq and sek genes but lacked the typical USA300 mobile elements ACME and PVL (Fig. 2).  FIG 2   Divergent SaPI3/SaPI5 pathogenicity islands. The alignment shows an E1 strain (MN-1310) containing a novel SaPI3-E1 region, USA300-FPR375 and (SaPI5), USA500-2395 (SaPI3) and an example of an E1 strain lacking an inserted island at this locus (CA-680). Conserved chromosome genes are colored blue. SaPI3-E1 and SaPI share little and SaPI3 and SaPI3-E1 themselves share limited nucleotide similarity. The SaPI site-specific integrase gene is colored green, and the sek/seq enterotoxins are colored purple. Gray shading shows regions with >95% nucleotide identity in blastn alignments. The figure was created using genoplotR (69).  Seventy-six percent (39/51) of E1 strains were typed as “USA500” by the CDC algorithm, whereas 83% (304/368) of strains in C1 and C2 were typed as “Iberian” (Table 1). If we assume that E1 corresponded to the “USA500” inferred PFGE type and that the C1 and C2 strains were “Iberian” (because the majority of strains from each respective clade had these types), the number of correctly typed strains was 343 out of 419 (82% accuracy). The major reason for the relatively low accuracy was the frequent turnover of pathogenicity islands and prophages in USA500 genomes. The seb gene used in the CDC algorithm (in addition to sek and seq) was on the SaPI5 pathogenicity island in USA300; an analogous island in COL and USA500 (SaPI3) carried sek and seq (Fig. 2) (21). The SaPI was common in C1 and C2, but most E1 strains did not contain either SaPI3 or SaPI5, although a subclade of 8 strains was found to have a previously undescribed variant of SaPI3 at the same chromosomal locus (called here SaPI3-E1), with low sequence identity to the other islands and lacking sek/seq homologs (Fig. 2). Families of S. aureus prophages inserted into different conserved sites in the genome and varied in frequency of occurrence between strain groups (22). The sea gene used for typing, as well as sak, was usually found on the phiSA3 prophage. This element was inserted at a site in the hlb hemolysin B gene in C1/C2, but in the E1 strains the DNA sequence of the element was missing the sea/sak genes (Fig. 2). Most C1 and C2 strains carried the phiSA2 prophages, which were rare in E1. Conversely, phiSA1 and phiSA6 were more common in E1 (75% and 45%, respectively) than other clades (Fig. 3).

The third and fourth columns are the inferred PFGE type to which the strains were assigned using methods described in https://www.cdc.gov/abcs/reports-findings/survreports/mrsa13.html. (Note that not all strains sequenced in this study were tested by the algorithm.)  FIG 3   Frequency of prophages in the major USA500 subclades.  Emergence of the USA500 clades.  Initial analysis suggested that there was a clock-like structure to the phylogeny, with strains sampled in earlier years nearer the root than those from later years. Therefore, we attempted to estimate the dates of diversification of the USA500 clades using a Bayesian molecular clock method implemented by the BEAST2 software package (23) (see Fig. S1 in the supplemental material). Key parameter predictions that could be cross-referenced against other studies were consistent with our estimates. For instance, our estimate of the substitution rate parameter (1.158e−6 mutations per nucleotide site per year) was similar to those of previous S. aureus studies: e.g., 1.3e−6 (24), 1.53e−6 (11), 1.25e−6 (10), and 1.34e−6 (2) (with the caveats that some of these studies had partially overlapping data sets and each used slightly different evolutionary models). Furthermore, the estimate of 1989 as the time to the most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) of the NAE group USA300 strain was within the ranges of other recent publications (3, 10, 11). The C1, C2, E1, and F clades all appeared to have emerged at time points toward the middle of the 20th century. We noted that the C2 clade tMRCA estimation was likely significantly retarded by the three deeply branching isolates. When these were removed, the tMRCA was 1972 (1945 to 1992, 95% high posterior density intervals). Each of the major clades’ Tajima’s D statistics was negative (Table 2), consistent with a recent population size expansion scenario.  10.1128/mSphere.00571-17.1  FIG S1   Dated reconstruction of USA500 clades using BEAST 2. A log-normal relaxed molecular clock was employed (see Materials and Methods for details), and we used the dates of isolation to calibrate the clock. Color coding is as follows: light blue clade, C1; dark blue clade, C2; red, clade USA300; and green, clade E1. The scale axis gives the years from 2013 going backwards in time.

USA500 clades differ in proportion of strains resistant to antibiotics.  The phenotypic antibiotic resistance profile was determined for most strains sequenced in this study using the reference broth microdilution (rBMD) method with CLSI (Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute)-recommended interpretive criteria (25) (Fig. 4). There was no trend toward increased resistance to greater numbers of drugs per strain over the time period 2005 through 2013 (see Fig. S2a in the supplemental material). However, it was notable that C1 strains were resistant to a greater number of antibiotics than C2 and E1 strains (Fig. S2b). Almost all C1 strains were resistant to tetracycline (60/64) and gentamicin (54/64) (Fig. 4). Most C1 (55/64) and C2 (324/325) strains tested were also resistant to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, a drug often used in treating community-acquired S. aureus SSTIs, but resistance was uncommon among E1 strains (3/72). These and other more sporadic resistance phenotypes were associated with the presence of horizontally acquired plasmids, the Tn916 conjugative transposon (which conferred tetracycline resistance), or a 3.3-kb insertion element containing the trimethoprim resistance gene dfrG (13, 26–28).  10.1128/mSphere.00571-17.2  FIG S2   Antibiotic resistance by year.

Most isolates tested (435/464 [94%]) were resistant to the fluoroquinolone (FQ) levofloxacin. We observed that FQ-susceptible strains tended to be on early branching lineages of the C2 and E1 clades. This mirrored the pattern seen in USA300, where a subgroup of strains that branched after an estimated point in 1994 were found to be FQ resistant (10, 11). These results suggested that resistance to FQ independently evolved in multiple emergent CC8 lineages.  Conserved IS256 insertion sites in C1 strains suggest expansion from an ancestor with multiple transposon insertions.  Insertion sequence IS256 was previously shown to play a significant role in the hypertoxicity of strain 2395 and other isolates from the C1 clade (18). The genome was notable for the presence of 18 identical copies of the insertion sequence IS256 (16 on the chromosome, 2 on the plasmid). Two IS256 elements in inverted orientation flank gentamicin and trimethoprim resistance genes to form transposon Tn4001, which is part of the pUSA500 plasmid. One IS256 element in the promoter of the rot (repression of toxin) gene, a master positive transcriptional regulator of toxin expression, was found to be responsible for increased cytotoxin production. The 73 USA500 isolates that contained at least one copy of IS256 included all 64 in C1. Benson et al. speculated that the pUSA500 plasmid spread IS256 to the USA500 chromosome (18). We found that 40 strains contained sequences similar to the pUSA500 plasmid, judged as having a BLAST match of more than 97% sequence identity over >13 kb of the 32-kb plasmid (accession no. CP007500.1). Only one strain carrying a pUSA500-like plasmid was outside the C1 clade (in C2). Meanwhile, seven strains outside C1 without a USA500-like plasmid had an IS256. Thus, there was not an absolute correlation of the presence of the plasmid with the transposon. Possibly the plasmid originally introduced the transposon in these strains and was cured after a time sufficient for IS256 to transpose into the chromosome.  We determined the chromosomal locations of IS256 insertions in our sequenced strains relative to the 2395 reference (18) in using the ISMapper tool (29). Within the C1 clade, the number of IS256 chromosomal insertion locations ranged from 9 to 42, while outside C1, the range was 1 to 3 locations. There was no trend toward increase in number of insertions per isolate during the period of collection (2005 to 2013) (see Fig. S3a in the supplemental material). Eleven insertion sites were common among almost all C1 strains (Fig. S3b), suggesting that these were present in the last common ancestor of the clade. These 11 sites included one upstream of the rot gene (18).  10.1128/mSphere.00571-17.3  FIG S3   IS256 elements. (a) Number of IS256 elements in C1 genomes over time.

USA500 C clade strains have a frameshift mutation in the adsA adenosine synthase gene  We noted that many USA500 strains had a premature stop in adsA, encoding adenosine synthase (previously called sasH [30]). The cell-wall-anchored protein encoded by adsA had been shown to aid in evasion of phagocytic clearance in blood, by catalyzing the production of adenosine, an anti-inflammatory signal molecule, from AMP (31). The wild-type AdsA protein has an LPXTG motif necessary for sortase-mediated anchoring to peptidoglycan on the cell surface (32) in the C terminus of the 773-amino-acid preprotein. The most important residues for 5′-nucleotidase activity are toward the N terminus: aspartic acid 127 and histidine 196 (see Fig. S4 in the supplemental material). All isolates in the C clade had a duplication of the “TCAA” quadruplet at nucleotide positions 340 to 343 of the wild type (see Fig. S5 in the supplemental material). The frameshift resulted in a truncated protein of 131 amino acids (as well as a predicted C-terminal stub of 636 amino acids) instead of the full-length 773-amino-acid sequence. The C-terminal stub was not predicted to have a signal sequence necessary for translocation out of the cytoplasm. Therefore, the truncated proteins, if they were stably expressed, would be predicted to be diminished in activity as surface-exposed adenosine synthases. This mutation clearly did not abolish the potential to cause human systemic illness, as might have been predicted from the result of earlier mouse bacteremia model studies (31), since all isolates were associated with invasive disease.  10.1128/mSphere.00571-17.4  FIG S4   Schematic of the adsA frameshift mutation.

ABSTRACT  USA500 isolates are clonal complex 8 (CC8) Staphylococcus aureus strains closely related to the prominent community- and hospital-associated USA300 group. Despite being relatively understudied, USA500 strains cause a significant burden of disease and are the third most common methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) strains identified in the U.S. Emerging Infections Program (EIP) invasive S. aureus surveillance. To better understand the genetic relationships of the strains, we sequenced the genomes of 539 USA500 MRSA isolates from sterile site infections collected through the EIP between 2005 and 2013 in the United States. USA500 isolates fell into three major clades principally separated by their distribution across different U.S. regions. Clade C1 strains, found principally in the Northeast, were associated with multiple IS256 insertion elements in their genomes and higher levels of antibiotic resistance. C2 was associated with Southern states, and E1 was associated with Western states. C1 and C2 strains all shared a frameshift in the gene encoding AdsA surface-attached surface protein. We propose that the term “USA500” should be used for CC8 strains sharing a recent common ancestor with the C1, C2, and E1 strains but not in the USA300 group.  IMPORTANCE In this work, we have removed some of the confusion surrounding the use of the name “USA500,” placed USA500 strains in the context of the CC8 group, and developed a strategy for assignment to subclades based on genome sequence.

""","  DISCUSSION  It is important to establish a consistent use of the name “USA500” that can be used for future epidemiological studies and comparisons. The terms “USA500” and “USA300” are derived from a PFGE typing scheme established in early 2000s (33) and represent different lineages within a single clonal complex (CC8) that acquired SCCmec type IV cassettes and increased in incidence in the human population. In essence, three definitions of the USA500 strain have been used in the literature, as described below: (i) USA500 PFGE type, (ii) USA500 sensu stricto as a single clade within CC8, and (iii) USA500 sensu lato as the genetic background to USA300 (e.g., as proposed by Glaser et al. [2]).  (i) USA500 PFGE type.  USA500 is the original designation associated with MRSA strain types in the United States, based on PFGE (1). However, PFGE will be performed less frequently on future isolates as clinical genome sequencing becomes more routine (34). We also showed that PFGE (before 2012) and the algorithm (after 2012) for inferring USA500 from “Iberian” PFGE using MLST or spa and sea/seb PCR was only 82% accurate in distinguishing USA500 and Iberian USA500 pulse types (Fig. 1; Table 1).  (ii) USA500 sensu stricto as a single clade within CC8.  If USA500 was represented a single clade, the primary candidates would be C1 and C2 or E1. Strain 2395 (C1) has been the reference genome for USA500 since the publication by Benson et al. (15). This strain was assumed to be representative of a unitary USA500 clade in the recent genomic analysis of CC8 by Strauß et al. (34), which led the authors to conclude that USA500 was not a direct ancestor of USA300. Alternatively, the marker-based typing scheme proposed by Li et al. designated the E1 clade as USA500 (11) (Fig. 1; Table 1). Designation of one or the other of these clades as the sole USA500 clade would have the advantage of casting USA500 as a true monophyletic clade. The problem is that any sensu stricto definition excludes many other strains that are commonly referred to in the literature as USA500.  (iii) USA500 sensu lato as the genetic background to USA300.  As proposed by Glaser et al. (2), USA500 sensu lato could be considered the genetic background to USA300. All CC8 non-USA300 strains that derive from an ancestor that contained a signature cap5D A nucleotide insertion at position 994 in the gene (5) could be considered USA500. Based on this definition, the CC8 sublineages C, D, and E (20) would all be considered USA500 (Fig. 1). We believe the “sensu lato” definition has the advantages of being simple and inclusive. One consequence of using this definition is that it would sequester some strains not previously considered USA500, including the recently described epidemic Russian clone OC8 (35) (Fig. 1). The clade containing all descendants of the common ancestor of USA300 and USA500 isolates (subgroups C to F) would be called USA300/USA500 (sensu lato).  The whole-genome phylogeny and molecular clock analysis revealed that the three major USA500 clades collected by the EIP had undergone population expansions in the United States from around the middle of the 20th century. USA300 emerged from the F sublineage and spread within the United States and internationally (36) rather than remaining regionally concentrated, as the USA500 clades did. Including the recent Russian OC8 strain (35), we now know there have been at least five significant expansions of virulent strains carrying SCCmec type IV cassettes from within the CC8 clonal complex (USA300, OC8, and the 3 USA500 clades). CC8 was also the origin of the first MRSA strains with the type I SCCmec cassette (ST250) in the early 1960s (37, 38). It has been suggested that the CC8 background in general and USA500/USA300 in particular have intrinsic high virulence potential (39, 40). Li et al. showed that USA300 strains and USA500 (clade E1) strain BD02-25 had greater virulence in a bacteremic mouse model than other CC8 strains and enhanced resistance to human antimicrobial peptides (12). Benson et al. also demonstrated the unusually high toxin levels of the C1 strain 2395 (18).  Each of the five expansions within CC8 (USA300, OC8, C1, C2, and E1) may have been the result of either specific genetic adaptations or chance events or a combination of both. Interestingly, there are parallels in the types of genetic changes acquired by each strain expansion and also unique differences. Antibiotic resistance may have played a role in the expansion of the C1 clade in particular (Fig. 4). Fluoroquinolone resistance, as an example, likely evolved in parallel on at least 4 occasions by the strains that form part of the study. There must have been particular selection pressure for survival of the effects of this class of antibiotics (possibly administered to treat other infections), and the mutations probably have low fitness cost, allowing them to persist in the population even in the absence of an antibiotic selective pressure. It has been suggested that the propensity for secretion of fluoroquinolones onto the skin through sweat may lead to high enough drug concentrations to effect selection (41).  In the case of OC8 and C1, parallel acquisition of IS256 seemed to be associated with expansion (18, 35). An IS256 element in strain 2395 (clade C1) disrupted the rot (repressor of toxicity) locus and increased toxin production (18). C1 strains containing IS256 were found to be more cytotoxic for human neutrophils (18, 42) and also exhibited greater virulence for mice in a systemic infection model (43). The OC8 strain had 19 IS256 copies, two of which, in inverted orientation, facilitated a 1-Mb genomic inversion in the main chromosome (35). IS256 is a catalyst for expansion in diverse S. aureus lineages and may affect numerous other phenotypes—for example, vancomycin resistance (44). IS256 transposition activity is enhanced by antibiotic concentration, which may be a clue in understanding the recent spread of the element in S. aureus and other pathogens (45–47). We surveyed a database of 3,755 published S. aureus Illumina genome assemblies for the IS256 transposase, finding identical or nearly identical (a maximum 2-nucleotide [nt] difference) sequences in a number of recent clonally expanding genotypes. These included 41/41 ST772 strains, an emerging Indian strain, CA-MRSA (48), and 50/50 ST239, a worldwide HA-MRSA clone contained IS256. IS256 was common (37/262 strains) in ST398, associated with human/livestock transmission (49). No USA300 strain contained IS256. The fact that very similar IS256 elements can move between S. aureus clonal complexes is fascinating given the known genetic barriers to transfer (50, 51). Genes with 100% nucleotide identity to the USA500 IS256 transposase gene were also found by BLAST in other bacterial species. These species included Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Staphylococcus pseudintermedius, Staphylococcus warneri, Staphylococcus capitis, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus durans, Clostridiales bacterium, Clostridium difficile, Mycoplasma mycoides, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli. This suggested IS256 is part of a recent genetic exchange community (26) that encompassed diverse genetic groups within S. aureus as well as several other pathogen species.  For USA300, the mobile ACME (or COMER) elements, speG, and PVL toxins were likely important for its success in community-associated infection (40). The E1 USA500 clade is most closely related to USA300 and may share some of its yet not fully understood adaptations that promote enhanced expression of extracellular toxins and increased transmission rate. The C subgroup had a synapomorphic frameshift mutation in the adsA gene encoding the core (52) surface protein. Previous studies have shown that AdsA is required for full virulence in mouse bacteremia models. A possible explanation invoking pathoadaptation is that the adsA functions to reduce inflammation when S. aureus is on the skin by promoting production of adenosine, a purine nucleotide and antagonist (53). Inflammation may contribute to more frequent transmission and spread of the bacteria by causing rashes and skin damage. The finding that the disrupted adsA gene is common in clinical USA500 MRSA isolates from the United States may also be significant in the future given that the encoded surface protein is a potential vaccine target (54).  In conclusion, whole-genome sequencing has resolved the conundrum of USA500 nomenclature and unveiled possibly important genetic changes (SNPs and horizontal acquisition of genes) that played a role in evolution of pathogenic CC8 MRSA by promoting virulence and/or transmission. These mutations can be used for subtyping CC8 strains using PCR or genome-based types. Functional studies are needed now to disentangle which mutations enhance the success of community and hospital pathogens and which are just random evolutionary noise.

PMC5932375,INTRODUCTION,Introduction,CP007499,1,0,0,,"""Here we aimed to investigate the diversity of USA500 isolates causing invasive infections in the United States through analysis of a large set of strains collected through EIP surveillance""","  INTRODUCTION  The name “USA500” is used to describe a group of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) clones that have emerged over the past 20 years as frequent causes of community-associated (CA) and health-care-associated infections in North America. USA500 was first defined as a distinct pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) type (1). Like the better known USA300 PFGE type, which has caused an epidemic of community-acquired infections in the United States (2, 3), USA500 strains mostly have the multilocus sequence type (MLST) ST8 genotype and are part of the CC8 clonal complex (4). Both USA300 and USA500 carry the type IV SCCmec cassette conferring resistance to β-lactam antibiotics and have conserved mutations in their capsule locus (5). USA300 strains are distinguished from USA500 by having Panton-Valentin leukocidin (PVL) toxin genes within a prophage of the phiSA2 family (6). Isolates of the North American epidemic (NAE) USA300 lineage have an arginine catabolic mobile element (ACME) cassette next to SCCmec, whereas those of the South American epidemic (SAE) lineage have a copper and mercury resistance (COMER) element at same locus (7). USA300 strains also have a SaPI5 pathogenicity island containing sek and seq enterotoxin genes (8). The arginine deiminase (arc) and polyamine resistance (speG) genes on the ACME cassette and the PVL toxin have been proposed as key determinants of the enhanced ability to cause skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) and transmissibility of USA300 (3, 9), although strains with deletions in these genes have been frequently reported (2, 10, 11).  It has been postulated that USA300 evolved as a clonal lineage from within a background of USA500 strains (2, 12). However, genome sequencing studies suggested the relationship was more complex, with USA500 strains assigned to different clades within CC8 (2, 3, 5, 13). Nomenclature for USA500 strains is also complicated. USA500 strains collected at the CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) were subdivided into two groups based on closely related PFGE types: true “USA500” and “Iberian.” Before 2012, the assignment was based largely on PFGE. From 2012 onward, an algorithm for inferring USA500 and Iberian was implemented (https://www.cdc.gov/HAI/settings/lab/CCalgorithm.html), which combined PFGE, spa, MLST, and PCR amplicon-based detection of key horizontally acquired staphylococcal enterotoxin A (sea) and B (seb) genes (12). Confusingly, the term “Iberian” was also earlier used to describe a PFGE type from an MRSA epidemic in Spain and other countries between 1990 and 1995 that was found to be ST247 (CC8) with SCCmec type Ia (14–16).  The CDC’s Emerging Infections Program (EIP) conducts active, laboratory- and population-based surveillance for invasive MRSA infections (17). Strains typed as USA500/Iberian have represented a significant proportion of EIP MRSA isolates. In 2013 (the final year in which we drew collected strains for sequencing in this study), they constituted 13.5% of health care-associated MRSA (HA-MRSA) strains collected at 5 surveillance sites (https://www.cdc.gov/abcs/reports-findings/surv-reports.html). Notably, in Georgia the incidence was higher than other sites, with USA500/Iberian representing 20% of all HA-MRSA infections over the period from 2012 through 2015 (R. Overton, personal communication). While numerous projects have investigated USA300 evolution through comparative genomics (2, 3, 10, 11, 13), fewer genomic studies have been performed on USA500. Here we aimed to investigate the diversity of USA500 isolates causing invasive infections in the United States through analysis of a large set of strains collected through EIP surveillance. The goal of this work was to arrive at a genetic definition of USA500 that can be used for future typing efforts and to understand its relationship to USA300.  ",FALSE,TRUE,

Invasive MRSA isolates were collected from California (CA), Colorado (CO), Connecticut (CT), Georgia (GA), Maryland (MD), Minnesota (MN), New York (NY), Oregon (OR), and Tennessee (TN) as part of the Emerging Infections Program (EIP) of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as previously described (55). All isolates were characterized at the CDC by SCCmec typing, detection of staphylococcal toxins, antimicrobial susceptibility testing, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) typing, and PCR typing as previously described (1, 55). PFGE was only performed from 2005 to 2008; from 2009 to 2011, an algorithm (https://www.cdc.gov/HAI/settings/lab/inferred-PFGE-algorithm.html) was used to infer PFGE type, and then between 2012 and 2013, a second algorithm incorporating spa typing was used (https://www.cdc.gov/HAI/settings/lab/CCalgorithm.html). From 758 strains classified as USA500/Iberian, 549 strains were chosen for whole-genome sequencing based on maximizing geographic and genetic diversity, based on metadata collected at the time of isolation. We used all the isolates from states other than Georgia, which had the majority of isolates. Strains from Georgia were randomly down-sampled using the criterion that all sampling years, hospitals, and unique PFGE patterns would be represented in the set selected for sequencing. The number of isolates chosen from each year varied between a high of 74 (2005) to a low of 49 (2013) (see Fig. S6 in the supplemental material).  10.1128/mSphere.00571-17.6  FIG S6   Number of strains sequenced each year (2005 to 2013).

Raw read data were deposited in the NCBI Short Read Archive under project accession no. PRJNA316461. The median sequence coverage for each genome was 89-fold with a median per base Q score of 37. One strain was excluded due to library failure.  Genome assembly and annotation.  Strains were assembled de novo using SPAdes v3.7.1 (56) and annotated using PROKKA v1.11 (57). FASTQ sequencing output files from strains with more than 100× coverage were down-sampled using a custom script (https://gist.github.com/rpetit3/9c623454758c9885bf81d269e3453b76) based on the seqtk toolkit (https://github.com/lh3/seqtk). Antibiotic resistance phenotypes were predicted for each strain based on the methods of Gordon et al. (58). Roary (59) was used to estimate a pan-genome from de novo-assembled contigs of the strains sequenced in the study. The MLST was ascertained using SRST2 (60). Two strains were excluded because pangenome content suggested they were not S. aureus, and 8 strains fell outside CC8 based on MLST patterns.  BLAST comparisons to assembled genome sequences.  Blast+ v2.2.28 was used for alignments. For short nucleotide sequences (<31 nt), we used the blastn with the “blastn-short” task and called matches with a greater than 90% identity and an alignment length of at least 15. For alignment of protein sequences, we used the tblastn program and called matches with at least 97% identity. For most larger nucleotide alignments, we used blastn with the megablast task and called matches with greater than 97% identity. For antibiotic resistance genes, we followed the guidelines of Gordin et al. (58) and used blastn with a word size parameter of 17, gapopen of 5, and gapextend of 2 and saved matches where the identity multiple by the ratio of the hit to the total length of the gene was greater than 0.8 (or 0.3 in the case of the blaZ, fusB, and far genes).  IS256 insertion sites.  All strains found to contain IS256 were processed using ISMapper v1.2 (29) to determine the transposon insertion sites. ISMapper used the paired-end FASTQ files of reads for each genome, the reference genome assembly (USA500-2395; accession no. CP007499.1) (18) and an IS256 query sequence (accession no. NC_013321.1) (33).  Phylogenetic tree estimation.  A whole-genome alignment of de novo-assembled contigs from 539 CC8 strains from this study and 24 CC8 strains described in other papers was processed using Parsnp (61). The alignment length was 2,361,133 bp. Potential recombination sites were identified using ClonalFrameML (24) based on a maximum likelihood (ML) guide tree constructed by PhyML (62, 63), removed using a custom R script, leaving a final alignment of 2,359,393 bp with 18,755 variable sites (SNPs). The alignment file, R script, and ClonalFrameML output listing recombinant sites have been made publicly available on FigShare (https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.5915257.v1). We performed ML tree estimation on the 2,359,393-bp alignment with 1,000 bootstraps using RAxML version 8.2.11 (63) with a GTRGAMMA model and one partition. The resulting phylogenetic trees were visualized with the Interactive Tree of Life (iTOL) web service (64). We chose ST250 COL (accession no. CP000046.1 [13]) as the outgroup, as it was the earliest branching strain in subgroups A to F when we included a more divergent ST630 in a pilot phylogeny. One strain in group F, CT-172, was pruned from the final tree because of a long branch. Visual inspection using the gingr tool (61) revealed the presence of a likely large recombinant region in this strain between 2.47 and 2.59 Mbp on the USA500-2395 reference coordinates that had not been detected by ClonalFrameML.  Statistical tests of metadata.  Seven metadata categories for each sample were provided: state, hospital identification, year of collection, culture source, patient age, in-hospital patient mortality (deceased, alive, and unknown) and sample class (HACO, CO, HA, and CA). A case was classified as HO if the MRSA culture was obtained on or after the fourth calendar day of hospitalization (where admission was hospital day 1). A case was classified as HACO if the culture was obtained in an outpatient setting or before the fourth calendar day of hospitalization and had one or more of the following: (i) a history of hospitalization, surgery, dialysis, or residence in a long-term-care facility in the previous year, or (ii) the presence of a central vascular catheter (CVC) within 2 days prior to MRSA culture. Finally, a case was classified as community-associated (CA) if none of the previously mentioned criteria were met. To test the significance of these categories on which clade the sample belongs to, we ran a permutation test on each category, and adjusted the output P values with a Bonferroni correction. Tests were implemented using the Independence Test from the coin R package (65) and p.adjust from the base statistics R package.  Molecular dating analysis.  We used BEAST 2.4.5 (23) to conduct the molecular dating analysis, incorporating a coalescent Bayesian skyline demographic model with 5 groups. We picked up to 5 isolates from each sampling year for each of the clades C1, C2, and E1. Where there were more than 5 strains in a clade for a given year, we randomly selected 5 using the R sample function. We picked all dated samples from sublineage F in Fig. 1 and representatives of ST247, ST250, and sublineages B and D as outgroups. COL (ST250) was set as the root of the tree as in the phylogenetic analysis described above. In total, 151 samples were used. We experimented with different subsampling strategies before selecting 130,000 randomly picked sites. We found larger data configurations (more isolates and/or more sites) did not reach effective sample sizes (ESSs) of >200 for many parameters even after 300,000,000 generations. We used a GTR+R substitution model with the correction for among-site variation. We obtained good estimates of the posterior distribution of the parameters in this analysis, as these parameters reached over 200 ESSs. We set an uncorrelated log-normal relaxed clock and calibrated the clock using the dates of collection of the isolates. The final analysis was run for 200,000,000 generations, sampling every 20,000 generations and discarding the first 20,000,000 generations as burn-in. We evaluated the convergence of the analysis by checking that all the parameters reached ESS values of >200 and by analyzing the trace plots of the likelihood scores. Furthermore, we ran the final analysis twice so as to check that the analysis was converging and the two runs reached very similar results (see Table S2 and Fig. S7 in the supplemental material). To test whether the subsampling strategy accurately reproduced variation in the data, given that we only used a subset of the sites, we created another 3 replicates (randomly subsampling the same number of sites), and molecular dating analyses were run on each replicate. We obtained similar results across all the replicates (see Fig. S8 in the supplemental material). Tajima’s D values for clades were calculated using VariScan (66).  10.1128/mSphere.00571-17.7  FIG S7   Convergence of molecular clock analyses.

We used the VCF format output of the whole-genome alignment to identify 31-mers unique to each major USA500 clade and USA300. Using Jellyfish (67), samples were queried for a nonzero count of each 31-mer from this list. Assignment of a strain to a clade was based on the presence of a strain-specific 31-mer from only one clade and the absence of 31-mers from other clades. We also extracted 31-mers associated with canonical SNPs defined by Bowers et al. (20) and used these to assign strains to sublineages A to F.  FIG 1   Maximum likelihood phylogeny of USA500 and other CC8 strains. The COL reference genome (68) was an outgroup. The major clades are color coded: F, green; E1, gray; D, purple; C1, dark blue; C2, blue; BA, brick red. The reference genome was strain 2395 in the C1 clade. The likelihood score for the tree was −3,374,456. (a) Circular view with locations of representative strains from each clade indicated in the text. Small black squares on the tree indicate branches supported by fewer than 90% bootstrap replicates. Outer ring 1 shows the results of inferred PFGE typing by PCR. Black indicates Iberian, gray indicates USA500, and white indicates other result or not done. The second ring is colored by U.S. state of origin: red, California; purple, Colorado; dark blue, Connecticut; light blue, Georgia; dark purple, Maryland; orange, Minnesota; yellow, New York; magenta, Oregon; green, Tennessee. The third ring (red squares) shows presence of an SaPI3/5-like site-specific integrase gene. The fourth ring (green squares) shows the presence of at least one copy of IS256 in the genome. Only results from strains sequenced in this study are shown on the outer rings. The figure was created by iTOL (64). The tree with full metadata is publicly available at http://itol.embl.de/tree/1701401041445011519064958. Panel b is the same tree as panel a but with all multistrain clades collapsed. The internal node that is the common ancestor of all USA500/USA300 isolates is marked with an asterisk. The percentage of bootstrap support is shown for each of the branches.

De novo-assembled contigs of the 539 strains typed as MRSA USA500, along with data from 24 published CC8 strains (listed with citations in Table S1 in the supplemental material), were aligned against the reference genome of strain 2395 (2,995,646 bp with a large plasmid [pUSA500] of 32,406 bp) (18). The 2395 strain, recovered from a wound infection in New York (18, 19), was originally assigned to the “Iberian” subgroup of USA500 based on the presence of the sea and seb genes. The whole-genome alignment of all 539 CC8 strains sequenced in this study plus 24 published genomes had a core region of 1,995 kbp (67.5% of the 2,956-kbp chromosome). Regions not part of the core alignment on the chromosome included prophages, pathogenicity islands, transposons, and other repeat sequences. Plasmid content was variable between strains and therefore excluded from consideration in the phylogenetic reconstruction. After recombinant regions were identified and removed, the final alignment consisting of 13,765 chromosomal single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) was used to estimate a maximum likelihood tree (Fig. 1). We labeled the CC8 sublineages A to F using a scheme developed recently (20) (Fig. 1).  10.1128/mSphere.00571-17.9  TABLE S1   Samples included from external studies.

FIG 1   Maximum likelihood phylogeny of USA500 and other CC8 strains. The COL reference genome (68) was an outgroup. The major clades are color coded: F, green; E1, gray; D, purple; C1, dark blue; C2, blue; BA, brick red. The reference genome was strain 2395 in the C1 clade. The likelihood score for the tree was −3,374,456. (a) Circular view with locations of representative strains from each clade indicated in the text. Small black squares on the tree indicate branches supported by fewer than 90% bootstrap replicates. Outer ring 1 shows the results of inferred PFGE typing by PCR. Black indicates Iberian, gray indicates USA500, and white indicates other result or not done. The second ring is colored by U.S. state of origin: red, California; purple, Colorado; dark blue, Connecticut; light blue, Georgia; dark purple, Maryland; orange, Minnesota; yellow, New York; magenta, Oregon; green, Tennessee. The third ring (red squares) shows presence of an SaPI3/5-like site-specific integrase gene. The fourth ring (green squares) shows the presence of at least one copy of IS256 in the genome. Only results from strains sequenced in this study are shown on the outer rings. The figure was created by iTOL (64). The tree with full metadata is publicly available at http://itol.embl.de/tree/1701401041445011519064958. Panel b is the same tree as panel a but with all multistrain clades collapsed. The internal node that is the common ancestor of all USA500/USA300 isolates is marked with an asterisk. The percentage of bootstrap support is shown for each of the branches. This tree is publicly available at http://itol.embl.de/tree/17014010416011519065058.  The phylogeny revealed that the majority of USA500/Iberian strains were in three major and discrete clades within CC8. Two of the USA500 clades were in the C sublineage and were designated C1 and C2. The other was in the E sublineage and was designated E1. Nineteen strains were placed outside these three clades: in USA300 (sublineage F), sublineage B, or deep-branching sublineages E and C (Fig. 1).  Metadata for each strain included patient age, epidemiological classification of infection (community-associated [CA], health care onset [HO], health care-associated community onset [HACO], or unknown), culture source (blood, cerebrospinal fluid [CSF], bone, etc.), outcome (lived, died, or unknown), and U.S. state of isolation. Using a permutation test, the three major USA500 clades defined here (C1, C2, and E1) were found to have a significantly nonrandom distribution in only the U.S. state of isolation metadata variable (P value of 9.7e−12), reflecting the geographical structuring of the USA500 clades.  The C1 clade (64 strains from this study) contained the strain 2395 USA500 isolate that was used as the reference genome sequence for this study (18). The majority (52/64 [81%]) of samples were from Maryland, Connecticut, or New York. Most C1 strains were ST8, with minority populations of ST609 and ST1508. The C2 clade corresponded to the group labeled as “USA500-like” by Jamrozy et al. (13). These strains were predominantly from Georgia and Tennessee (351/378). One strain was typed as ST476, and the rest were ST8. E1 clade strains were predominantly isolated in California, Colorado, Minnesota, and Oregon (63/78 [81%]). This clade contained the BD02-25 strain originally used as the USA500 reference isolate (12). Of these, 36/78 (46%) were ST2253 and the rest were ST8. Two strains closely related to USA300 contained the S. aureus pathogenicity island (SaPI5) with USA300-like seq and sek genes but lacked the typical USA300 mobile elements ACME and PVL (Fig. 2).  FIG 2   Divergent SaPI3/SaPI5 pathogenicity islands. The alignment shows an E1 strain (MN-1310) containing a novel SaPI3-E1 region, USA300-FPR375 and (SaPI5), USA500-2395 (SaPI3) and an example of an E1 strain lacking an inserted island at this locus (CA-680). Conserved chromosome genes are colored blue. SaPI3-E1 and SaPI share little and SaPI3 and SaPI3-E1 themselves share limited nucleotide similarity. The SaPI site-specific integrase gene is colored green, and the sek/seq enterotoxins are colored purple. Gray shading shows regions with >95% nucleotide identity in blastn alignments. The figure was created using genoplotR (69).  Seventy-six percent (39/51) of E1 strains were typed as “USA500” by the CDC algorithm, whereas 83% (304/368) of strains in C1 and C2 were typed as “Iberian” (Table 1). If we assume that E1 corresponded to the “USA500” inferred PFGE type and that the C1 and C2 strains were “Iberian” (because the majority of strains from each respective clade had these types), the number of correctly typed strains was 343 out of 419 (82% accuracy). The major reason for the relatively low accuracy was the frequent turnover of pathogenicity islands and prophages in USA500 genomes. The seb gene used in the CDC algorithm (in addition to sek and seq) was on the SaPI5 pathogenicity island in USA300; an analogous island in COL and USA500 (SaPI3) carried sek and seq (Fig. 2) (21). The SaPI was common in C1 and C2, but most E1 strains did not contain either SaPI3 or SaPI5, although a subclade of 8 strains was found to have a previously undescribed variant of SaPI3 at the same chromosomal locus (called here SaPI3-E1), with low sequence identity to the other islands and lacking sek/seq homologs (Fig. 2). Families of S. aureus prophages inserted into different conserved sites in the genome and varied in frequency of occurrence between strain groups (22). The sea gene used for typing, as well as sak, was usually found on the phiSA3 prophage. This element was inserted at a site in the hlb hemolysin B gene in C1/C2, but in the E1 strains the DNA sequence of the element was missing the sea/sak genes (Fig. 2). Most C1 and C2 strains carried the phiSA2 prophages, which were rare in E1. Conversely, phiSA1 and phiSA6 were more common in E1 (75% and 45%, respectively) than other clades (Fig. 3).

(Note that not all strains sequenced in this study were tested by the algorithm.)  FIG 3   Frequency of prophages in the major USA500 subclades.  Emergence of the USA500 clades.  Initial analysis suggested that there was a clock-like structure to the phylogeny, with strains sampled in earlier years nearer the root than those from later years. Therefore, we attempted to estimate the dates of diversification of the USA500 clades using a Bayesian molecular clock method implemented by the BEAST2 software package (23) (see Fig. S1 in the supplemental material). Key parameter predictions that could be cross-referenced against other studies were consistent with our estimates. For instance, our estimate of the substitution rate parameter (1.158e−6 mutations per nucleotide site per year) was similar to those of previous S. aureus studies: e.g., 1.3e−6 (24), 1.53e−6 (11), 1.25e−6 (10), and 1.34e−6 (2) (with the caveats that some of these studies had partially overlapping data sets and each used slightly different evolutionary models). Furthermore, the estimate of 1989 as the time to the most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) of the NAE group USA300 strain was within the ranges of other recent publications (3, 10, 11). The C1, C2, E1, and F clades all appeared to have emerged at time points toward the middle of the 20th century. We noted that the C2 clade tMRCA estimation was likely significantly retarded by the three deeply branching isolates. When these were removed, the tMRCA was 1972 (1945 to 1992, 95% high posterior density intervals). Each of the major clades’ Tajima’s D statistics was negative (Table 2), consistent with a recent population size expansion scenario.  10.1128/mSphere.00571-17.1  FIG S1   Dated reconstruction of USA500 clades using BEAST 2. A log-normal relaxed molecular clock was employed (see Materials and Methods for details), and we used the dates of isolation to calibrate the clock. Color coding is as follows: light blue clade, C1; dark blue clade, C2; red, clade USA300; and green, clade E1. The scale axis gives the years from 2013 going backwards in time.

USA500 clades differ in proportion of strains resistant to antibiotics.  The phenotypic antibiotic resistance profile was determined for most strains sequenced in this study using the reference broth microdilution (rBMD) method with CLSI (Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute)-recommended interpretive criteria (25) (Fig. 4). There was no trend toward increased resistance to greater numbers of drugs per strain over the time period 2005 through 2013 (see Fig. S2a in the supplemental material). However, it was notable that C1 strains were resistant to a greater number of antibiotics than C2 and E1 strains (Fig. S2b). Almost all C1 strains were resistant to tetracycline (60/64) and gentamicin (54/64) (Fig. 4). Most C1 (55/64) and C2 (324/325) strains tested were also resistant to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, a drug often used in treating community-acquired S. aureus SSTIs, but resistance was uncommon among E1 strains (3/72). These and other more sporadic resistance phenotypes were associated with the presence of horizontally acquired plasmids, the Tn916 conjugative transposon (which conferred tetracycline resistance), or a 3.3-kb insertion element containing the trimethoprim resistance gene dfrG (13, 26–28).  10.1128/mSphere.00571-17.2  FIG S2   Antibiotic resistance by year.

FIG 4   Percentage of resistance to antibiotics that showed significant variability between USA500 clades measured by rBMD. CH, chloramphenicol; CL, clindamycin; EY, erythromycin; DX, doxycycline; TE, tetracycline; GM, gentamicin; LV, levofloxacin; RI, rifampin; TS, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole.  Most isolates tested (435/464 [94%]) were resistant to the fluoroquinolone (FQ) levofloxacin. We observed that FQ-susceptible strains tended to be on early branching lineages of the C2 and E1 clades. This mirrored the pattern seen in USA300, where a subgroup of strains that branched after an estimated point in 1994 were found to be FQ resistant (10, 11). These results suggested that resistance to FQ independently evolved in multiple emergent CC8 lineages.  Conserved IS256 insertion sites in C1 strains suggest expansion from an ancestor with multiple transposon insertions.  Insertion sequence IS256 was previously shown to play a significant role in the hypertoxicity of strain 2395 and other isolates from the C1 clade (18). The genome was notable for the presence of 18 identical copies of the insertion sequence IS256 (16 on the chromosome, 2 on the plasmid). Two IS256 elements in inverted orientation flank gentamicin and trimethoprim resistance genes to form transposon Tn4001, which is part of the pUSA500 plasmid. One IS256 element in the promoter of the rot (repression of toxin) gene, a master positive transcriptional regulator of toxin expression, was found to be responsible for increased cytotoxin production. The 73 USA500 isolates that contained at least one copy of IS256 included all 64 in C1. Benson et al. speculated that the pUSA500 plasmid spread IS256 to the USA500 chromosome (18). We found that 40 strains contained sequences similar to the pUSA500 plasmid, judged as having a BLAST match of more than 97% sequence identity over >13 kb of the 32-kb plasmid (accession no. CP007500.1). Only one strain carrying a pUSA500-like plasmid was outside the C1 clade (in C2). Meanwhile, seven strains outside C1 without a USA500-like plasmid had an IS256. Thus, there was not an absolute correlation of the presence of the plasmid with the transposon. Possibly the plasmid originally introduced the transposon in these strains and was cured after a time sufficient for IS256 to transpose into the chromosome.  We determined the chromosomal locations of IS256 insertions in our sequenced strains relative to the 2395 reference (18) in using the ISMapper tool (29). Within the C1 clade, the number of IS256 chromosomal insertion locations ranged from 9 to 42, while outside C1, the range was 1 to 3 locations. There was no trend toward increase in number of insertions per isolate during the period of collection (2005 to 2013) (see Fig. S3a in the supplemental material). Eleven insertion sites were common among almost all C1 strains (Fig. S3b), suggesting that these were present in the last common ancestor of the clade. These 11 sites included one upstream of the rot gene (18).  10.1128/mSphere.00571-17.3  FIG S3   IS256 elements. (a) Number of IS256 elements in C1 genomes over time.

USA500 C clade strains have a frameshift mutation in the adsA adenosine synthase gene  We noted that many USA500 strains had a premature stop in adsA, encoding adenosine synthase (previously called sasH [30]). The cell-wall-anchored protein encoded by adsA had been shown to aid in evasion of phagocytic clearance in blood, by catalyzing the production of adenosine, an anti-inflammatory signal molecule, from AMP (31). The wild-type AdsA protein has an LPXTG motif necessary for sortase-mediated anchoring to peptidoglycan on the cell surface (32) in the C terminus of the 773-amino-acid preprotein. The most important residues for 5′-nucleotidase activity are toward the N terminus: aspartic acid 127 and histidine 196 (see Fig. S4 in the supplemental material). All isolates in the C clade had a duplication of the “TCAA” quadruplet at nucleotide positions 340 to 343 of the wild type (see Fig. S5 in the supplemental material). The frameshift resulted in a truncated protein of 131 amino acids (as well as a predicted C-terminal stub of 636 amino acids) instead of the full-length 773-amino-acid sequence. The C-terminal stub was not predicted to have a signal sequence necessary for translocation out of the cytoplasm. Therefore, the truncated proteins, if they were stably expressed, would be predicted to be diminished in activity as surface-exposed adenosine synthases. This mutation clearly did not abolish the potential to cause human systemic illness, as might have been predicted from the result of earlier mouse bacteremia model studies (31), since all isolates were associated with invasive disease.  10.1128/mSphere.00571-17.4  FIG S4   Schematic of the adsA frameshift mutation.

ABSTRACT  USA500 isolates are clonal complex 8 (CC8) Staphylococcus aureus strains closely related to the prominent community- and hospital-associated USA300 group. Despite being relatively understudied, USA500 strains cause a significant burden of disease and are the third most common methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) strains identified in the U.S. Emerging Infections Program (EIP) invasive S. aureus surveillance. To better understand the genetic relationships of the strains, we sequenced the genomes of 539 USA500 MRSA isolates from sterile site infections collected through the EIP between 2005 and 2013 in the United States. USA500 isolates fell into three major clades principally separated by their distribution across different U.S. regions. Clade C1 strains, found principally in the Northeast, were associated with multiple IS256 insertion elements in their genomes and higher levels of antibiotic resistance. C2 was associated with Southern states, and E1 was associated with Western states. C1 and C2 strains all shared a frameshift in the gene encoding AdsA surface-attached surface protein. We propose that the term “USA500” should be used for CC8 strains sharing a recent common ancestor with the C1, C2, and E1 strains but not in the USA300 group.  IMPORTANCE In this work, we have removed some of the confusion surrounding the use of the name “USA500,” placed USA500 strains in the context of the CC8 group, and developed a strategy for assignment to subclades based on genome sequence.

""","  DISCUSSION  It is important to establish a consistent use of the name “USA500” that can be used for future epidemiological studies and comparisons. The terms “USA500” and “USA300” are derived from a PFGE typing scheme established in early 2000s (33) and represent different lineages within a single clonal complex (CC8) that acquired SCCmec type IV cassettes and increased in incidence in the human population. In essence, three definitions of the USA500 strain have been used in the literature, as described below: (i) USA500 PFGE type, (ii) USA500 sensu stricto as a single clade within CC8, and (iii) USA500 sensu lato as the genetic background to USA300 (e.g., as proposed by Glaser et al. [2]).  (i) USA500 PFGE type.  USA500 is the original designation associated with MRSA strain types in the United States, based on PFGE (1). However, PFGE will be performed less frequently on future isolates as clinical genome sequencing becomes more routine (34). We also showed that PFGE (before 2012) and the algorithm (after 2012) for inferring USA500 from “Iberian” PFGE using MLST or spa and sea/seb PCR was only 82% accurate in distinguishing USA500 and Iberian USA500 pulse types (Fig. 1; Table 1).  (ii) USA500 sensu stricto as a single clade within CC8.  If USA500 was represented a single clade, the primary candidates would be C1 and C2 or E1. Strain 2395 (C1) has been the reference genome for USA500 since the publication by Benson et al. (15). This strain was assumed to be representative of a unitary USA500 clade in the recent genomic analysis of CC8 by Strauß et al. (34), which led the authors to conclude that USA500 was not a direct ancestor of USA300. Alternatively, the marker-based typing scheme proposed by Li et al. designated the E1 clade as USA500 (11) (Fig. 1; Table 1). Designation of one or the other of these clades as the sole USA500 clade would have the advantage of casting USA500 as a true monophyletic clade. The problem is that any sensu stricto definition excludes many other strains that are commonly referred to in the literature as USA500.  (iii) USA500 sensu lato as the genetic background to USA300.  As proposed by Glaser et al. (2), USA500 sensu lato could be considered the genetic background to USA300. All CC8 non-USA300 strains that derive from an ancestor that contained a signature cap5D A nucleotide insertion at position 994 in the gene (5) could be considered USA500. Based on this definition, the CC8 sublineages C, D, and E (20) would all be considered USA500 (Fig. 1). We believe the “sensu lato” definition has the advantages of being simple and inclusive. One consequence of using this definition is that it would sequester some strains not previously considered USA500, including the recently described epidemic Russian clone OC8 (35) (Fig. 1). The clade containing all descendants of the common ancestor of USA300 and USA500 isolates (subgroups C to F) would be called USA300/USA500 (sensu lato).  The whole-genome phylogeny and molecular clock analysis revealed that the three major USA500 clades collected by the EIP had undergone population expansions in the United States from around the middle of the 20th century. USA300 emerged from the F sublineage and spread within the United States and internationally (36) rather than remaining regionally concentrated, as the USA500 clades did. Including the recent Russian OC8 strain (35), we now know there have been at least five significant expansions of virulent strains carrying SCCmec type IV cassettes from within the CC8 clonal complex (USA300, OC8, and the 3 USA500 clades). CC8 was also the origin of the first MRSA strains with the type I SCCmec cassette (ST250) in the early 1960s (37, 38). It has been suggested that the CC8 background in general and USA500/USA300 in particular have intrinsic high virulence potential (39, 40). Li et al. showed that USA300 strains and USA500 (clade E1) strain BD02-25 had greater virulence in a bacteremic mouse model than other CC8 strains and enhanced resistance to human antimicrobial peptides (12). Benson et al. also demonstrated the unusually high toxin levels of the C1 strain 2395 (18).  Each of the five expansions within CC8 (USA300, OC8, C1, C2, and E1) may have been the result of either specific genetic adaptations or chance events or a combination of both. Interestingly, there are parallels in the types of genetic changes acquired by each strain expansion and also unique differences. Antibiotic resistance may have played a role in the expansion of the C1 clade in particular (Fig. 4). Fluoroquinolone resistance, as an example, likely evolved in parallel on at least 4 occasions by the strains that form part of the study. There must have been particular selection pressure for survival of the effects of this class of antibiotics (possibly administered to treat other infections), and the mutations probably have low fitness cost, allowing them to persist in the population even in the absence of an antibiotic selective pressure. It has been suggested that the propensity for secretion of fluoroquinolones onto the skin through sweat may lead to high enough drug concentrations to effect selection (41).  In the case of OC8 and C1, parallel acquisition of IS256 seemed to be associated with expansion (18, 35). An IS256 element in strain 2395 (clade C1) disrupted the rot (repressor of toxicity) locus and increased toxin production (18). C1 strains containing IS256 were found to be more cytotoxic for human neutrophils (18, 42) and also exhibited greater virulence for mice in a systemic infection model (43). The OC8 strain had 19 IS256 copies, two of which, in inverted orientation, facilitated a 1-Mb genomic inversion in the main chromosome (35). IS256 is a catalyst for expansion in diverse S. aureus lineages and may affect numerous other phenotypes—for example, vancomycin resistance (44). IS256 transposition activity is enhanced by antibiotic concentration, which may be a clue in understanding the recent spread of the element in S. aureus and other pathogens (45–47). We surveyed a database of 3,755 published S. aureus Illumina genome assemblies for the IS256 transposase, finding identical or nearly identical (a maximum 2-nucleotide [nt] difference) sequences in a number of recent clonally expanding genotypes. These included 41/41 ST772 strains, an emerging Indian strain, CA-MRSA (48), and 50/50 ST239, a worldwide HA-MRSA clone contained IS256. IS256 was common (37/262 strains) in ST398, associated with human/livestock transmission (49). No USA300 strain contained IS256. The fact that very similar IS256 elements can move between S. aureus clonal complexes is fascinating given the known genetic barriers to transfer (50, 51). Genes with 100% nucleotide identity to the USA500 IS256 transposase gene were also found by BLAST in other bacterial species. These species included Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Staphylococcus pseudintermedius, Staphylococcus warneri, Staphylococcus capitis, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus durans, Clostridiales bacterium, Clostridium difficile, Mycoplasma mycoides, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli. This suggested IS256 is part of a recent genetic exchange community (26) that encompassed diverse genetic groups within S. aureus as well as several other pathogen species.  For USA300, the mobile ACME (or COMER) elements, speG, and PVL toxins were likely important for its success in community-associated infection (40). The E1 USA500 clade is most closely related to USA300 and may share some of its yet not fully understood adaptations that promote enhanced expression of extracellular toxins and increased transmission rate. The C subgroup had a synapomorphic frameshift mutation in the adsA gene encoding the core (52) surface protein. Previous studies have shown that AdsA is required for full virulence in mouse bacteremia models. A possible explanation invoking pathoadaptation is that the adsA functions to reduce inflammation when S. aureus is on the skin by promoting production of adenosine, a purine nucleotide and antagonist (53). Inflammation may contribute to more frequent transmission and spread of the bacteria by causing rashes and skin damage. The finding that the disrupted adsA gene is common in clinical USA500 MRSA isolates from the United States may also be significant in the future given that the encoded surface protein is a potential vaccine target (54).  In conclusion, whole-genome sequencing has resolved the conundrum of USA500 nomenclature and unveiled possibly important genetic changes (SNPs and horizontal acquisition of genes) that played a role in evolution of pathogenic CC8 MRSA by promoting virulence and/or transmission. These mutations can be used for subtyping CC8 strains using PCR or genome-based types. Functional studies are needed now to disentangle which mutations enhance the success of community and hospital pathogens and which are just random evolutionary noise.

PMC5932375,INTRODUCTION,Introduction,CP007500,1,0,0,,"""Here we aimed to investigate the diversity of USA500 isolates causing invasive infections in the United States through analysis of a large set of strains collected through EIP surveillance""","  INTRODUCTION  The name “USA500” is used to describe a group of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) clones that have emerged over the past 20 years as frequent causes of community-associated (CA) and health-care-associated infections in North America. USA500 was first defined as a distinct pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) type (1). Like the better known USA300 PFGE type, which has caused an epidemic of community-acquired infections in the United States (2, 3), USA500 strains mostly have the multilocus sequence type (MLST) ST8 genotype and are part of the CC8 clonal complex (4). Both USA300 and USA500 carry the type IV SCCmec cassette conferring resistance to β-lactam antibiotics and have conserved mutations in their capsule locus (5). USA300 strains are distinguished from USA500 by having Panton-Valentin leukocidin (PVL) toxin genes within a prophage of the phiSA2 family (6). Isolates of the North American epidemic (NAE) USA300 lineage have an arginine catabolic mobile element (ACME) cassette next to SCCmec, whereas those of the South American epidemic (SAE) lineage have a copper and mercury resistance (COMER) element at same locus (7). USA300 strains also have a SaPI5 pathogenicity island containing sek and seq enterotoxin genes (8). The arginine deiminase (arc) and polyamine resistance (speG) genes on the ACME cassette and the PVL toxin have been proposed as key determinants of the enhanced ability to cause skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) and transmissibility of USA300 (3, 9), although strains with deletions in these genes have been frequently reported (2, 10, 11).  It has been postulated that USA300 evolved as a clonal lineage from within a background of USA500 strains (2, 12). However, genome sequencing studies suggested the relationship was more complex, with USA500 strains assigned to different clades within CC8 (2, 3, 5, 13). Nomenclature for USA500 strains is also complicated. USA500 strains collected at the CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) were subdivided into two groups based on closely related PFGE types: true “USA500” and “Iberian.” Before 2012, the assignment was based largely on PFGE. From 2012 onward, an algorithm for inferring USA500 and Iberian was implemented (https://www.cdc.gov/HAI/settings/lab/CCalgorithm.html), which combined PFGE, spa, MLST, and PCR amplicon-based detection of key horizontally acquired staphylococcal enterotoxin A (sea) and B (seb) genes (12). Confusingly, the term “Iberian” was also earlier used to describe a PFGE type from an MRSA epidemic in Spain and other countries between 1990 and 1995 that was found to be ST247 (CC8) with SCCmec type Ia (14–16).  The CDC’s Emerging Infections Program (EIP) conducts active, laboratory- and population-based surveillance for invasive MRSA infections (17). Strains typed as USA500/Iberian have represented a significant proportion of EIP MRSA isolates. In 2013 (the final year in which we drew collected strains for sequencing in this study), they constituted 13.5% of health care-associated MRSA (HA-MRSA) strains collected at 5 surveillance sites (https://www.cdc.gov/abcs/reports-findings/surv-reports.html). Notably, in Georgia the incidence was higher than other sites, with USA500/Iberian representing 20% of all HA-MRSA infections over the period from 2012 through 2015 (R. Overton, personal communication). While numerous projects have investigated USA300 evolution through comparative genomics (2, 3, 10, 11, 13), fewer genomic studies have been performed on USA500. Here we aimed to investigate the diversity of USA500 isolates causing invasive infections in the United States through analysis of a large set of strains collected through EIP surveillance. The goal of this work was to arrive at a genetic definition of USA500 that can be used for future typing efforts and to understand its relationship to USA300.  ",FALSE,TRUE,

Invasive MRSA isolates were collected from California (CA), Colorado (CO), Connecticut (CT), Georgia (GA), Maryland (MD), Minnesota (MN), New York (NY), Oregon (OR), and Tennessee (TN) as part of the Emerging Infections Program (EIP) of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as previously described (55). All isolates were characterized at the CDC by SCCmec typing, detection of staphylococcal toxins, antimicrobial susceptibility testing, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) typing, and PCR typing as previously described (1, 55). PFGE was only performed from 2005 to 2008; from 2009 to 2011, an algorithm (https://www.cdc.gov/HAI/settings/lab/inferred-PFGE-algorithm.html) was used to infer PFGE type, and then between 2012 and 2013, a second algorithm incorporating spa typing was used (https://www.cdc.gov/HAI/settings/lab/CCalgorithm.html). From 758 strains classified as USA500/Iberian, 549 strains were chosen for whole-genome sequencing based on maximizing geographic and genetic diversity, based on metadata collected at the time of isolation. We used all the isolates from states other than Georgia, which had the majority of isolates. Strains from Georgia were randomly down-sampled using the criterion that all sampling years, hospitals, and unique PFGE patterns would be represented in the set selected for sequencing. The number of isolates chosen from each year varied between a high of 74 (2005) to a low of 49 (2013) (see Fig. S6 in the supplemental material).  10.1128/mSphere.00571-17.6  FIG S6   Number of strains sequenced each year (2005 to 2013).

DNA isolation.  MRSA was grown overnight at 35°C on Trypticase soy agar with 5% sheep’s blood (BAP) (Becton, Dickinson and Company, Sparks, MD). Bacterial colonies from the third and fourth quadrants of the BAP were transferred into 1.5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) with 0.02% Tween (PBST) and centrifuged at 13,200 × g for 2 min at room temperature. Cells were resuspended in 1.5 ml of PBST and centrifuged at 13,200 × g for 2 min at room temperature two more times and resuspended in 1.5 ml PBST. Nine hundred microliters of each sample was transferred into a Lysing Matrix E tube (MP Biochemicals), vortexed for 3 min, and then centrifuged at 5,000 × g for 1 min, and 200 µl was transferred into an SEV cartridge (MP Biochemicals) and processed per the manufacturer’s instructions on the Maxwell 16 or Maxwell 16 MDx instrument (Promega).  Whole-genome shotgun sequencing.  Libraries constructed using whole-genome DNA preparations were sequenced using an Illumina HiSeq 2500 instrument. Raw read data were deposited in the NCBI Short Read Archive under project accession no. PRJNA316461. The median sequence coverage for each genome was 89-fold with a median per base Q score of 37. One strain was excluded due to library failure.  Genome assembly and annotation.  Strains were assembled de novo using SPAdes v3.7.1 (56) and annotated using PROKKA v1.11 (57). FASTQ sequencing output files from strains with more than 100× coverage were down-sampled using a custom script (https://gist.github.com/rpetit3/9c623454758c9885bf81d269e3453b76) based on the seqtk toolkit (https://github.com/lh3/seqtk). Antibiotic resistance phenotypes were predicted for each strain based on the methods of Gordon et al. (58). Roary (59) was used to estimate a pan-genome from de novo-assembled contigs of the strains sequenced in the study. The MLST was ascertained using SRST2 (60). Two strains were excluded because pangenome content suggested they were not S. aureus, and 8 strains fell outside CC8 based on MLST patterns.  BLAST comparisons to assembled genome sequences.  Blast+ v2.2.28 was used for alignments. For short nucleotide sequences (<31 nt), we used the blastn with the “blastn-short” task and called matches with a greater than 90% identity and an alignment length of at least 15. For alignment of protein sequences, we used the tblastn program and called matches with at least 97% identity. For most larger nucleotide alignments, we used blastn with the megablast task and called matches with greater than 97% identity. For antibiotic resistance genes, we followed the guidelines of Gordin et al. (58) and used blastn with a word size parameter of 17, gapopen of 5, and gapextend of 2 and saved matches where the identity multiple by the ratio of the hit to the total length of the gene was greater than 0.8 (or 0.3 in the case of the blaZ, fusB, and far genes).  IS256 insertion sites.  All strains found to contain IS256 were processed using ISMapper v1.2 (29) to determine the transposon insertion sites. ISMapper used the paired-end FASTQ files of reads for each genome, the reference genome assembly (USA500-2395; accession no. CP007499.1) (18) and an IS256 query sequence (accession no. NC_013321.1) (33).  Phylogenetic tree estimation.  A whole-genome alignment of de novo-assembled contigs from 539 CC8 strains from this study and 24 CC8 strains described in other papers was processed using Parsnp (61). The alignment length was 2,361,133 bp. Potential recombination sites were identified using ClonalFrameML (24) based on a maximum likelihood (ML) guide tree constructed by PhyML (62, 63), removed using a custom R script, leaving a final alignment of 2,359,393 bp with 18,755 variable sites (SNPs). The alignment file, R script, and ClonalFrameML output listing recombinant sites have been made publicly available on FigShare (https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.5915257.v1). We performed ML tree estimation on the 2,359,393-bp alignment with 1,000 bootstraps using RAxML version 8.2.11 (63) with a GTRGAMMA model and one partition. The resulting phylogenetic trees were visualized with the Interactive Tree of Life (iTOL) web service (64). We chose ST250 COL (accession no. CP000046.1 [13]) as the outgroup, as it was the earliest branching strain in subgroups A to F when we included a more divergent ST630 in a pilot phylogeny. One strain in group F, CT-172, was pruned from the final tree because of a long branch. Visual inspection using the gingr tool (61) revealed the presence of a likely large recombinant region in this strain between 2.47 and 2.59 Mbp on the USA500-2395 reference coordinates that had not been detected by ClonalFrameML.  Statistical tests of metadata.  Seven metadata categories for each sample were provided: state, hospital identification, year of collection, culture source, patient age, in-hospital patient mortality (deceased, alive, and unknown) and sample class (HACO, CO, HA, and CA). A case was classified as HO if the MRSA culture was obtained on or after the fourth calendar day of hospitalization (where admission was hospital day 1). A case was classified as HACO if the culture was obtained in an outpatient setting or before the fourth calendar day of hospitalization and had one or more of the following: (i) a history of hospitalization, surgery, dialysis, or residence in a long-term-care facility in the previous year, or (ii) the presence of a central vascular catheter (CVC) within 2 days prior to MRSA culture. Finally, a case was classified as community-associated (CA) if none of the previously mentioned criteria were met. To test the significance of these categories on which clade the sample belongs to, we ran a permutation test on each category, and adjusted the output P values with a Bonferroni correction. Tests were implemented using the Independence Test from the coin R package (65) and p.adjust from the base statistics R package.  Molecular dating analysis.  We used BEAST 2.4.5 (23) to conduct the molecular dating analysis, incorporating a coalescent Bayesian skyline demographic model with 5 groups. We picked up to 5 isolates from each sampling year for each of the clades C1, C2, and E1. Where there were more than 5 strains in a clade for a given year, we randomly selected 5 using the R sample function. We picked all dated samples from sublineage F in Fig. 1 and representatives of ST247, ST250, and sublineages B and D as outgroups. COL (ST250) was set as the root of the tree as in the phylogenetic analysis described above. In total, 151 samples were used. We experimented with different subsampling strategies before selecting 130,000 randomly picked sites. We found larger data configurations (more isolates and/or more sites) did not reach effective sample sizes (ESSs) of >200 for many parameters even after 300,000,000 generations. We used a GTR+R substitution model with the correction for among-site variation. We obtained good estimates of the posterior distribution of the parameters in this analysis, as these parameters reached over 200 ESSs. We set an uncorrelated log-normal relaxed clock and calibrated the clock using the dates of collection of the isolates. The final analysis was run for 200,000,000 generations, sampling every 20,000 generations and discarding the first 20,000,000 generations as burn-in. We evaluated the convergence of the analysis by checking that all the parameters reached ESS values of >200 and by analyzing the trace plots of the likelihood scores. Furthermore, we ran the final analysis twice so as to check that the analysis was converging and the two runs reached very similar results (see Table S2 and Fig. S7 in the supplemental material). To test whether the subsampling strategy accurately reproduced variation in the data, given that we only used a subset of the sites, we created another 3 replicates (randomly subsampling the same number of sites), and molecular dating analyses were run on each replicate. We obtained similar results across all the replicates (see Fig. S8 in the supplemental material). Tajima’s D values for clades were calculated using VariScan (66).  10.1128/mSphere.00571-17.7  FIG S7   Convergence of molecular clock analyses.

We used the VCF format output of the whole-genome alignment to identify 31-mers unique to each major USA500 clade and USA300. Using Jellyfish (67), samples were queried for a nonzero count of each 31-mer from this list. Assignment of a strain to a clade was based on the presence of a strain-specific 31-mer from only one clade and the absence of 31-mers from other clades. We also extracted 31-mers associated with canonical SNPs defined by Bowers et al. (20) and used these to assign strains to sublineages A to F.  FIG 1   Maximum likelihood phylogeny of USA500 and other CC8 strains. The COL reference genome (68) was an outgroup. The major clades are color coded: F, green; E1, gray; D, purple; C1, dark blue; C2, blue; BA, brick red. The reference genome was strain 2395 in the C1 clade. The likelihood score for the tree was −3,374,456. (a) Circular view with locations of representative strains from each clade indicated in the text. Small black squares on the tree indicate branches supported by fewer than 90% bootstrap replicates. Outer ring 1 shows the results of inferred PFGE typing by PCR. Black indicates Iberian, gray indicates USA500, and white indicates other result or not done. The second ring is colored by U.S. state of origin: red, California; purple, Colorado; dark blue, Connecticut; light blue, Georgia; dark purple, Maryland; orange, Minnesota; yellow, New York; magenta, Oregon; green, Tennessee. The third ring (red squares) shows presence of an SaPI3/5-like site-specific integrase gene. The fourth ring (green squares) shows the presence of at least one copy of IS256 in the genome. Only results from strains sequenced in this study are shown on the outer rings. The figure was created by iTOL (64).

De novo-assembled contigs of the 539 strains typed as MRSA USA500, along with data from 24 published CC8 strains (listed with citations in Table S1 in the supplemental material), were aligned against the reference genome of strain 2395 (2,995,646 bp with a large plasmid [pUSA500] of 32,406 bp) (18). The 2395 strain, recovered from a wound infection in New York (18, 19), was originally assigned to the “Iberian” subgroup of USA500 based on the presence of the sea and seb genes. The whole-genome alignment of all 539 CC8 strains sequenced in this study plus 24 published genomes had a core region of 1,995 kbp (67.5% of the 2,956-kbp chromosome). Regions not part of the core alignment on the chromosome included prophages, pathogenicity islands, transposons, and other repeat sequences. Plasmid content was variable between strains and therefore excluded from consideration in the phylogenetic reconstruction. After recombinant regions were identified and removed, the final alignment consisting of 13,765 chromosomal single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) was used to estimate a maximum likelihood tree (Fig. 1). We labeled the CC8 sublineages A to F using a scheme developed recently (20) (Fig. 1).  10.1128/mSphere.00571-17.9  TABLE S1   Samples included from external studies.

FIG 1   Maximum likelihood phylogeny of USA500 and other CC8 strains. The COL reference genome (68) was an outgroup. The major clades are color coded: F, green; E1, gray; D, purple; C1, dark blue; C2, blue; BA, brick red. The reference genome was strain 2395 in the C1 clade. The likelihood score for the tree was −3,374,456. (a) Circular view with locations of representative strains from each clade indicated in the text. Small black squares on the tree indicate branches supported by fewer than 90% bootstrap replicates. Outer ring 1 shows the results of inferred PFGE typing by PCR. Black indicates Iberian, gray indicates USA500, and white indicates other result or not done. The second ring is colored by U.S. state of origin: red, California; purple, Colorado; dark blue, Connecticut; light blue, Georgia; dark purple, Maryland; orange, Minnesota; yellow, New York; magenta, Oregon; green, Tennessee. The third ring (red squares) shows presence of an SaPI3/5-like site-specific integrase gene. The fourth ring (green squares) shows the presence of at least one copy of IS256 in the genome. Only results from strains sequenced in this study are shown on the outer rings. The figure was created by iTOL (64). The tree with full metadata is publicly available at http://itol.embl.de/tree/1701401041445011519064958. Panel b is the same tree as panel a but with all multistrain clades collapsed. The internal node that is the common ancestor of all USA500/USA300 isolates is marked with an asterisk. The percentage of bootstrap support is shown for each of the branches. This tree is publicly available at http://itol.embl.de/tree/17014010416011519065058.  The phylogeny revealed that the majority of USA500/Iberian strains were in three major and discrete clades within CC8. Two of the USA500 clades were in the C sublineage and were designated C1 and C2. The other was in the E sublineage and was designated E1. Nineteen strains were placed outside these three clades: in USA300 (sublineage F), sublineage B, or deep-branching sublineages E and C (Fig. 1).  Metadata for each strain included patient age, epidemiological classification of infection (community-associated [CA], health care onset [HO], health care-associated community onset [HACO], or unknown), culture source (blood, cerebrospinal fluid [CSF], bone, etc.), outcome (lived, died, or unknown), and U.S. state of isolation. Using a permutation test, the three major USA500 clades defined here (C1, C2, and E1) were found to have a significantly nonrandom distribution in only the U.S. state of isolation metadata variable (P value of 9.7e−12), reflecting the geographical structuring of the USA500 clades.  The C1 clade (64 strains from this study) contained the strain 2395 USA500 isolate that was used as the reference genome sequence for this study (18). The majority (52/64 [81%]) of samples were from Maryland, Connecticut, or New York. Most C1 strains were ST8, with minority populations of ST609 and ST1508. The C2 clade corresponded to the group labeled as “USA500-like” by Jamrozy et al. (13). These strains were predominantly from Georgia and Tennessee (351/378). One strain was typed as ST476, and the rest were ST8. E1 clade strains were predominantly isolated in California, Colorado, Minnesota, and Oregon (63/78 [81%]). This clade contained the BD02-25 strain originally used as the USA500 reference isolate (12). Of these, 36/78 (46%) were ST2253 and the rest were ST8. Two strains closely related to USA300 contained the S. aureus pathogenicity island (SaPI5) with USA300-like seq and sek genes but lacked the typical USA300 mobile elements ACME and PVL (Fig. 2).  FIG 2   Divergent SaPI3/SaPI5 pathogenicity islands. The alignment shows an E1 strain (MN-1310) containing a novel SaPI3-E1 region, USA300-FPR375 and (SaPI5), USA500-2395 (SaPI3) and an example of an E1 strain lacking an inserted island at this locus (CA-680). Conserved chromosome genes are colored blue. SaPI3-E1 and SaPI share little and SaPI3 and SaPI3-E1 themselves share limited nucleotide similarity. The SaPI site-specific integrase gene is colored green, and the sek/seq enterotoxins are colored purple. Gray shading shows regions with >95% nucleotide identity in blastn alignments. The figure was created using genoplotR (69).  Seventy-six percent (39/51) of E1 strains were typed as “USA500” by the CDC algorithm, whereas 83% (304/368) of strains in C1 and C2 were typed as “Iberian” (Table 1). If we assume that E1 corresponded to the “USA500” inferred PFGE type and that the C1 and C2 strains were “Iberian” (because the majority of strains from each respective clade had these types), the number of correctly typed strains was 343 out of 419 (82% accuracy). The major reason for the relatively low accuracy was the frequent turnover of pathogenicity islands and prophages in USA500 genomes. The seb gene used in the CDC algorithm (in addition to sek and seq) was on the SaPI5 pathogenicity island in USA300; an analogous island in COL and USA500 (SaPI3) carried sek and seq (Fig. 2) (21). The SaPI was common in C1 and C2, but most E1 strains did not contain either SaPI3 or SaPI5, although a subclade of 8 strains was found to have a previously undescribed variant of SaPI3 at the same chromosomal locus (called here SaPI3-E1), with low sequence identity to the other islands and lacking sek/seq homologs (Fig. 2). Families of S. aureus prophages inserted into different conserved sites in the genome and varied in frequency of occurrence between strain groups (22). The sea gene used for typing, as well as sak, was usually found on the phiSA3 prophage. This element was inserted at a site in the hlb hemolysin B gene in C1/C2, but in the E1 strains the DNA sequence of the element was missing the sea/sak genes (Fig. 2). Most C1 and C2 strains carried the phiSA2 prophages, which were rare in E1. Conversely, phiSA1 and phiSA6 were more common in E1 (75% and 45%, respectively) than other clades (Fig. 3).

(Note that not all strains sequenced in this study were tested by the algorithm.)  FIG 3   Frequency of prophages in the major USA500 subclades.  Emergence of the USA500 clades.  Initial analysis suggested that there was a clock-like structure to the phylogeny, with strains sampled in earlier years nearer the root than those from later years. Therefore, we attempted to estimate the dates of diversification of the USA500 clades using a Bayesian molecular clock method implemented by the BEAST2 software package (23) (see Fig. S1 in the supplemental material). Key parameter predictions that could be cross-referenced against other studies were consistent with our estimates. For instance, our estimate of the substitution rate parameter (1.158e−6 mutations per nucleotide site per year) was similar to those of previous S. aureus studies: e.g., 1.3e−6 (24), 1.53e−6 (11), 1.25e−6 (10), and 1.34e−6 (2) (with the caveats that some of these studies had partially overlapping data sets and each used slightly different evolutionary models). Furthermore, the estimate of 1989 as the time to the most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) of the NAE group USA300 strain was within the ranges of other recent publications (3, 10, 11). The C1, C2, E1, and F clades all appeared to have emerged at time points toward the middle of the 20th century. We noted that the C2 clade tMRCA estimation was likely significantly retarded by the three deeply branching isolates. When these were removed, the tMRCA was 1972 (1945 to 1992, 95% high posterior density intervals). Each of the major clades’ Tajima’s D statistics was negative (Table 2), consistent with a recent population size expansion scenario.  10.1128/mSphere.00571-17.1  FIG S1   Dated reconstruction of USA500 clades using BEAST 2. A log-normal relaxed molecular clock was employed (see Materials and Methods for details), and we used the dates of isolation to calibrate the clock. Color coding is as follows: light blue clade, C1; dark blue clade, C2; red, clade USA300; and green, clade E1. The scale axis gives the years from 2013 going backwards in time.

USA500 clades differ in proportion of strains resistant to antibiotics.  The phenotypic antibiotic resistance profile was determined for most strains sequenced in this study using the reference broth microdilution (rBMD) method with CLSI (Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute)-recommended interpretive criteria (25) (Fig. 4). There was no trend toward increased resistance to greater numbers of drugs per strain over the time period 2005 through 2013 (see Fig. S2a in the supplemental material). However, it was notable that C1 strains were resistant to a greater number of antibiotics than C2 and E1 strains (Fig. S2b). Almost all C1 strains were resistant to tetracycline (60/64) and gentamicin (54/64) (Fig. 4). Most C1 (55/64) and C2 (324/325) strains tested were also resistant to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, a drug often used in treating community-acquired S. aureus SSTIs, but resistance was uncommon among E1 strains (3/72). These and other more sporadic resistance phenotypes were associated with the presence of horizontally acquired plasmids, the Tn916 conjugative transposon (which conferred tetracycline resistance), or a 3.3-kb insertion element containing the trimethoprim resistance gene dfrG (13, 26–28).  10.1128/mSphere.00571-17.2  FIG S2   Antibiotic resistance by year.

FIG 4   Percentage of resistance to antibiotics that showed significant variability between USA500 clades measured by rBMD. CH, chloramphenicol; CL, clindamycin; EY, erythromycin; DX, doxycycline; TE, tetracycline; GM, gentamicin; LV, levofloxacin; RI, rifampin; TS, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole.  Most isolates tested (435/464 [94%]) were resistant to the fluoroquinolone (FQ) levofloxacin. We observed that FQ-susceptible strains tended to be on early branching lineages of the C2 and E1 clades. This mirrored the pattern seen in USA300, where a subgroup of strains that branched after an estimated point in 1994 were found to be FQ resistant (10, 11). These results suggested that resistance to FQ independently evolved in multiple emergent CC8 lineages.  Conserved IS256 insertion sites in C1 strains suggest expansion from an ancestor with multiple transposon insertions.  Insertion sequence IS256 was previously shown to play a significant role in the hypertoxicity of strain 2395 and other isolates from the C1 clade (18). The genome was notable for the presence of 18 identical copies of the insertion sequence IS256 (16 on the chromosome, 2 on the plasmid). Two IS256 elements in inverted orientation flank gentamicin and trimethoprim resistance genes to form transposon Tn4001, which is part of the pUSA500 plasmid. One IS256 element in the promoter of the rot (repression of toxin) gene, a master positive transcriptional regulator of toxin expression, was found to be responsible for increased cytotoxin production. The 73 USA500 isolates that contained at least one copy of IS256 included all 64 in C1. Benson et al. speculated that the pUSA500 plasmid spread IS256 to the USA500 chromosome (18). We found that 40 strains contained sequences similar to the pUSA500 plasmid, judged as having a BLAST match of more than 97% sequence identity over >13 kb of the 32-kb plasmid (accession no. CP007500.1). Only one strain carrying a pUSA500-like plasmid was outside the C1 clade (in C2). Meanwhile, seven strains outside C1 without a USA500-like plasmid had an IS256. Thus, there was not an absolute correlation of the presence of the plasmid with the transposon. Possibly the plasmid originally introduced the transposon in these strains and was cured after a time sufficient for IS256 to transpose into the chromosome.  We determined the chromosomal locations of IS256 insertions in our sequenced strains relative to the 2395 reference (18) in using the ISMapper tool (29). Within the C1 clade, the number of IS256 chromosomal insertion locations ranged from 9 to 42, while outside C1, the range was 1 to 3 locations. There was no trend toward increase in number of insertions per isolate during the period of collection (2005 to 2013) (see Fig. S3a in the supplemental material). Eleven insertion sites were common among almost all C1 strains (Fig. S3b), suggesting that these were present in the last common ancestor of the clade. These 11 sites included one upstream of the rot gene (18).  10.1128/mSphere.00571-17.3  FIG S3   IS256 elements. (a) Number of IS256 elements in C1 genomes over time.

USA500 C clade strains have a frameshift mutation in the adsA adenosine synthase gene  We noted that many USA500 strains had a premature stop in adsA, encoding adenosine synthase (previously called sasH [30]). The cell-wall-anchored protein encoded by adsA had been shown to aid in evasion of phagocytic clearance in blood, by catalyzing the production of adenosine, an anti-inflammatory signal molecule, from AMP (31). The wild-type AdsA protein has an LPXTG motif necessary for sortase-mediated anchoring to peptidoglycan on the cell surface (32) in the C terminus of the 773-amino-acid preprotein. The most important residues for 5′-nucleotidase activity are toward the N terminus: aspartic acid 127 and histidine 196 (see Fig. S4 in the supplemental material). All isolates in the C clade had a duplication of the “TCAA” quadruplet at nucleotide positions 340 to 343 of the wild type (see Fig. S5 in the supplemental material). The frameshift resulted in a truncated protein of 131 amino acids (as well as a predicted C-terminal stub of 636 amino acids) instead of the full-length 773-amino-acid sequence. The C-terminal stub was not predicted to have a signal sequence necessary for translocation out of the cytoplasm. Therefore, the truncated proteins, if they were stably expressed, would be predicted to be diminished in activity as surface-exposed adenosine synthases. This mutation clearly did not abolish the potential to cause human systemic illness, as might have been predicted from the result of earlier mouse bacteremia model studies (31), since all isolates were associated with invasive disease.  10.1128/mSphere.00571-17.4  FIG S4   Schematic of the adsA frameshift mutation.

PMC6316102,1. Introduction,Introduction,DQ811788,0,0,0,,,"  1. Introduction  Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) belongs to the genus Alphacoronavirus of subfamily Coronavirinae, which is in the family Coronaviridae, order Nidovirales [1,2]. The capped PEDV genome of ≈28 kilobases consists of a 5′ untranslated region (UTR), open reading frames (ORFs), and a 3′ UTR that includes the poly(A) tail [3]. RNA elements in the 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions (UTRs) that are important for coronaviral gene expression are collectively referred to as cis-acting RNA elements [4]. For the coronavirus, the transcription regulatory sequence (TRS) is a cis-acting RNA element required for subgenomic mRNA (sgmRNA) synthesis that is located downstream of the leader sequence and upstream of each ORF in the 3′-proximal genome region [5]. An upstream open reading frame (uORF) located in the 5′ UTR of coronaviruses has been shown to be important for virus fitness [6].  Analyses of Alphacoronavirus 5′ UTRs have revealed four conserved RNA secondary structures, including stem-loops (SLs) 1, 2, 4, and 5, which are also conserved for Betacoronavirus [4,7]. Moreover, studies in Betacoronavirus have determined a requirement of these 5′ secondary structures for coronaviral RNA synthesis [8]. RNA structures and their functions in coronaviral RNA synthesis and pathogenesis have also been identified in Betacoronavirus 3′ UTRs, including the 5′-most bulged stem-loop (BSL) [9,10], hair-pin pseudoknot (PK) [11], and 3′-most hypervariable region (HVR) [12]. However, structural analyses by Madhugiri et al. have suggested the absence of a BSL equivalent in Alphacoronavirus [4]. Both Alphacoronavirus and Betacoronavirus contain the conserved octanucleotide sequence 5′-GGAAGAGC-3′ within the HVR [4].  Synthesis of sgmRNA in coronaviruses requires a conserved TRS sequence motif, which is located at the 3′ end of the leader sequence (TRS-L) and precedes each 3′ proximal gene (TRS-B). The TRS contains a conserved sequence (CS) flanked by variable sequences at its 5′ (5′ TRS) and 3′ (3′ TRS) ends [5,13]. During negative-strand sgmRNA synthesis, coronaviral polymerase along with negative-strand sgmRNA attenuates at the TRS-B, switches the template to the TRS-L, as guided by basepairing between the TRS-B and TRS-L, and then resumes to complete synthesis by copying the leader sequence [14,15]. In comparison with the 5′ TRS, the 3′ TRS has a more decisive influence on sgmRNA synthesis [16,17]. It has been proposed that a one-nucleotide (nt) (A) deletion immediately downstream of the CS-L may influence PEDV sgmRNA synthesis [3,18,19], though an in-depth examination to support this hypothesis has not been conducted.  The PEDV prototype strain CV777 was first identified in 1978, and suckling piglets infected with this strain exhibited only mild diarrhea [20,21,22]. In 2013, the sudden appearance of porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) with more severe diarrhea in the USA and a subsequent reoccurrence in Asian countries including Taiwan caused serious economic losses [3,23,24]. PED has since been one of the most devastating swine diseases worldwide. With such outbreaks, a crucial question is whether the pathogenicity of PEDV has been altered, leading to serious disease outbreaks. Because the coronavirus spike (S) protein interacts with a cellular receptor during virus entry [25,26] and functions by inducing neutralizing antibodies in the natural host [27,28,29], many studies have focused on a sequence comparison of the S protein between emergent or re-emergent PEDV strains and the prototype strain CV777 to seek a possible answer for PED outbreaks [18,24,30,31]. In addition to S protein, whether other factors play roles in the outbreak remain to be elucidated.  The evolution of cis-acting elements in PEDV has not been previously analyzed. In this study, we determined whether the cis-acting elements that are required for gene expression are altered in the PEDV Taiwan (TW) strain in comparison with those of the PEDV prototype strain CV777. Functional analyses were also performed to determine whether the identified variations in cis-acting elements between the two strains alter the efficiency of translation, replication (genomic RNA synthesis), and transcription (sgmRNA synthesis) of the virus. The results may extend our understanding for the recent PED outbreaks in Taiwan and other countries.  ",FALSE,TRUE,

Sample Collection  Fecal and intestinal samples were collected from the Animal Disease Diagnostic Center of National Chung Hsing University and National Pingtung University of Science and Technology between January 2014 and December 2016. The total sample size was 38. Samples were homogenized, and RNA was extracted using TRIzol (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.  2.2. Amplification of the Genome and sgmRNA Using RT-PCR and Sequencing Analyses  Random hexamer primers were used for reverse transcription (RT) with SuperScript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), and the resulting cDNA was used for PCR with PfuUltra II high-fidelity DNA polymerase (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA) and oligonucleotides PEDV 25(−) and PEDV 450(+) for the 5′ UTR and PEDV 27488 (−) and PEDV 3′end (+) for the 3′ UTR (Table S1). The resulting 50-µL PCR mixture was heated to 94 °C for 2 min and subjected to 34 cycles of 30 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 55 °C, and 30 s at 72 °C. The extreme 5′ and 3′ termini of the PEDV genome were identified via rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. To amplify each of the sgmRNA for identification of the core sequence, oligonucleotide PEDV 25(−) and a corresponding reverse primer specific for each sgmRNA (Table S1) were used, followed by sequencing analyses. To identify the sgmRNA derived from PEDV 3′ UTR, oligonucleotides PEDV 25(−) and PEDV 3′utr (+) were used. The resulting 50-µL PCR mixture was heated to 94 °C for 2 min and subjected to 30 cycles of 30 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 55 °C, and 90 s at 72 °C.  2.3. Plasmid Constructs  To construct the PEDV TW defective interfering (DI) RNA pTWDI, an overlap PCR mutagenesis procedure was performed, as previously described [32], but with oligonucleotides T7-PEDV5′UTR(−) and PEDV26696(+), and PEDV TW strain cDNA in the first PCR; oligonucleotides PEDV 26541 (−) and PEDV3′end (+), and PEDV TW strain cDNA in the second PCR; and oligonucleotides T7-PEDV 5′UTR(−) and PEDV 3′end (+), and the products of the first two reactions in a third PCR. The resulting PCR product was then cloned into the TOPO XL vector (Thermo Fisher Scientific). To construct CV777 DI RNA, in which both the 5′ and 3′ UTR were from PEDV CV777 but the remaining sequences were from PEDV TW, pTWDI was used as a template; the aforementioned overlap PCR mutagenesis procedure was also performed with mutation oligonucleotides listed in Table S1. Mutants pTWDI-EP, pCV777DI-EP, pΔ AS-TRS, and pS-TRS were similarly constructed, except for the corresponding oligonucleotides used in the first and second reactions, as described in Table S1.  2.4. Analysis of DI RNA and sgm DI RNA Synthesis Using RT-qPCR  The PEDV TW strain (GenBank Accession No. KP276252) was obtained from Dr. Hui-Wen Chang (National Taiwan University) [33] and used as the helper virus for the DI RNA replication assay. The PEDV TW strain was maintained in Vero cells, as previously described [34,35]; the viral titer was 105 TCID50/mL. Vero cells in 35-mm dishes were infected with 200 µL of 105 TCID50/mL of PEDVPT-P5. The DNA constructs pTWDI, pCV777DI, pΔA S-TRS, and pS-TRS were linearized with MluI, transcribed in vitro to synthesize RNA transcripts with the mMessage mMachine T7 transcription kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s instructions and passed through a Biospin 6 column (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). After 2 h of infection with the helper virus, 3 µg of RNA transcript was transfected into the cells. To detect replication of PEDV DI RNA and DI RNA-derived sgmRNAs (sgm DI RNA), the supernatant was collected at 48 hour posttransfection (hpt) and then used to infect fresh Vero cells (virus passage 1, VP1). Ten micrograms of TRIzol-extracted total cellular RNA at 48 hpi of VP1 was used for the RT reaction with the reporter oligonucleotide TGEV(+) and SuperScript III reverse transcriptase (Thermo Fisher Scientific). To examine synthesis of DI RNA, SYBR® green amplification mix (Roche Applied Science, Mannheim, Germany) and primers PEDV476(−) and TGEV(+) were used for qPCR according to the manufacturer’s protocol. To analyze the synthesis of sgm DI RNA, primers PEDVL20(−), which binds to the leader sequence, and 5′GD(+), which binds to the reporter gene, were employed to differentiate the DI RNA from the helper virus PEDV. In these experiments, dilutions of plasmids containing the same gene as the detected DI RNA or sgm DI RNA were always run in parallel with the quantitated cDNA for use in standard curves (dilutions ranged from 108 to 10 copies of each plasmid). The amount of synthesized RNA was normalized to the levels of internal controls, including helper virus genomic RNA, 18S rRNA, and DI RNA. The reactions were performed with an initial pre-incubation at 95 °C for 5 min, followed by 35 amplification cycles of 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 60 s.  2.5. Western Blot Analysis for DI RNA Translation in Cells  The DNA constructs pTWDI-EP and pCV777DI-EP were linearized with MluI, transcribed in vitro with the mMessage mMachine T7 transcription kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s instructions, and passed through a Biospin 6 column (Bio-Rad). Vero cells were then transfected with 3 µg of transcript RNA, and proteins in cell lysates were collected at 16 h posttransfection. The protein samples were separated using 12% sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) gels and electrotransferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL, USA). An antibody against enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) was used as the primary antibody; goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (HRPO) was the secondary antibody (Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME, USA). Detected EGFP was visualized using Western Lightning™ Chemiluminescence Reagent (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA, USA) and X-ray film (Kodak, Rochester, NY, USA).  2.6.

Values are presented as the mean ± standard deviation (SD) (n = 3); * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, and *** p < 0.001.

Results and Discussion  3.1. Comparison of Sequence and Structure in the 5′ UTR between CV777 and TW Strain  Madhugiria et al. showed that the ≈310 nts of the 5′ terminal genome region of Alphacoronavirus form four secondary structures: SL1, SL2, SL4, and SL5 [4]. Accordingly, the sequence representing the 300 nts of the 5′ terminal region obtained for PEDV-positive samples (TW strain) were analyzed and compared with that of the PEDV prototype CV777. To understand whether the sequences for the 5′ terminal genome region of other PEDV strains are also altered, the reference strains were also selected from GenBank based on the viruses that have been circulating in different countries in recent years (2012–2015) and compared. As shown in Figure 1, in comparison with CV777, a U-insertion at nt 48; an A deletion at nt 73, which was located immediately downstream of the TRS core sequence (CUAAAC); and a 4-nt deletion (UUCC) from nt 93 to 96 were identified. In addition, the bases at positions 8, 104, 122, and 292 were also altered to a G, C, A, and U, respectively. Of the PEDV reference strains selected from other countries, the 5′-terminal sequence for the TW strain shared 100% nucleotide identity with that of the USA, Germany, and Korea reference strains. The change of the C and A at positions 104 and 122, respectively, also altered the amino acid encoded by the uORF (Figure 1B,C). Using the Mfold algorithm [36], four SLs were identified in the 5′ terminal genome region of PEDV and the results were in agreement with those found by Madhugiria et al. in Alphacoronaviruses [4]. In comparison with CV777, the change at nt 8 for the TW strain slightly altered the structure of SL1 (Figure 1C), and the U-insertion at nt 48 slightly altered the loop but not the stem structure of SL2. The free energy (∆G) of SL1 and SL2 was found to increase from −11.1 and −1.8 kcal/mol for the CV777 strain to −12.5 and −3.9 kcal/mol for the TW strain, respectively. The 4-nt deletion plus 2 alterations in SL4 also slightly affected the overall structure of SL4, and a decrease in ∆G from −27.4 for CV777 strain to −24.3 kcal/mol was calculated for TW strain. Although the U-alteration at nt 292 did not impair the structure of SL5, ∆G decreased from −53.2 to −51.6 kcal/mol. The overall ∆G of the four structures for CV777 and Taiwan strain was found to be −97.3 and −96.2 kcal/mol, respectively.  3.2. Comparison of 3′ UTR Sequence and Structure between CV777 and TW Strains  Using a sequencing analysis of 3′ UTR, either U or C at nt −49 was found from PEDV-positive samples (TW strain). The PEDV TW strain was therefore divided into two groups: Taiwan group A (with U at nt −49) and Taiwan group B (with C at nt −49) (Figure 2A). Regarding 3′ UTR, 7- and 8-nt differences between CV777 and TW groups A and B, respectively, were identified (Figure 2A). TW strain group A shared 100% nt identity with the USA and Korea strains. The C at nt −49 in the TW group B is unique because it was not identified in any sequenced PEDV genome, as based on data from GenBank; thus, it can be used as a genetic marker to differentiate the TW strain from other PEDV strains. Using the Mfold algorithm [36], the BSL, PK, and HVR structures were predicted (Figure 2B). Of the nts that are different from those of CV777, one nt is located in the BSL structure, and three nts (TW strain group A) and four nts (TW strain group B) are located in the HVR structure. However, these changes do not alter the overall structure of BSL and HVR; the ∆G for both structures was found to be slightly increased in comparison with that for CV777.  3.3. Identification of a Novel Subgenomic mRNA Species Derived from the 3′ UTR  While analyzing the 3′ UTR sequences of TW strain, with the primers annealing the 5′ leader sequence and 3′ UTR, the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) products with a length of ≈1700 base pairs (bp) and ≈250 bp were observed (Figure 3A, lane 2). After sequencing analysis, the ≈1700 bp RT-PCR product was identified to be N sgmRNA and the ≈250 bp RT-PCR product, which consisted of a leader sequence and a part of the sequence from 3′ UTR, was a previously unidentified sgmRNA species. The sgmRNA was derived from the CS-like sequence UUAAAC, which encompassed the stop codon of the N gene (Figure 3B, upper panel). The potential start codon AUG of the sgmRNA, which was located one nt downstream of the CS-like sequence, was also identified (Figure 3B, upper panel), and the ORF was predicted to encode a protein of 35 amino acids (Figure 3B, lower panel). In TGEV, sgmRNA 7 was also derived from a CS at a genome position similar to that in PEDV (Figure 3C), and the encoded protein of 78 amino acids has been demonstrated to be involved in the virulence [37]. Such a CS sequence at a position similar to that PEDV was also found in coronavirus 229E and Scotophilus bat coronavirus 512 (Figure 3C), though the sgmRNAs derived from both putative CSs have not been experimentally identified. In comparison with CV777, three nts and three amino acids were altered within the ORF (Figure 3D,E, respectively). The region downstream of the gene encoding the N protein shows variations among Alphacoronaviruses, which may explain why the conserved counterpart of the Betacoronavirus BSL structure [9,10] could not be identified as a common structure in Alphacoronaviruses [4]. For PEDV, the BSL structure was identified using the Mfold algorithm [36], as shown in Figure 2B, yet it was located within the putative ORF, as described above (Figure 3D). The function of the protein encoded by the ORF of the sgmRNA and the importance of the predicted BSL structure to PEDV replication remain to be elucidated.  3.4. Effects of the Cis-Acting Element Variations between CV777 and TW Strains on Gene Expression  Coronavirus DI RNA has been intensively employed for gene expression analyses [38,39,40,41,42]. To determine whether the observed variations in the 5′ and 3′ UTRs between TW and CV777 strains alter the efficiency of gene expression, a PEDV DI RNA for the TW strain was constructed; it was designated TW DI (Figure 4A). Because the CV777 strain was not available due to regulations in Taiwan, a CV777 DI RNA (designated CV777 DI, Figure 4B) was constructed via mutagenesis, which had TW DI as a backbone but with the CV777 5′ and 3′ UTRs. For translation analysis, both DI RNAs were engineered to contain a reporter EGFP gene (Figure 4A) designated CV777 DI-EP and TW DI-EP. Vero cells were transfected with 3 µg of in vitro-transcribed RNA, and proteins in cell lysates were collected at 16 h posttransfection. The amount of synthesized EGFP was normalized to the levels of internal controls including β-actin and DI RNA. Note that both the DI RNAs cannot replicate because of the lack of helper virus in transfected cells and the stability of the two DI RNAs was similar at the time of RNA collection (data not shown). As shown in Figure 4C,D, the translation efficiency of TW DI-EP was ≈2.5-fold better than that of CV777 DI-EP, suggesting that the sequence alterations in the 5′ and 3′ UTRs of TW DI-EP increased the translation efficiency in comparison with that of strain CV777. Note that, because uORF has been suggested to have an influence on translation, in addition to alterations in sequence and structure at the 5′ and 3′ UTRs, the amino acid changes for uORF (Figure 1) may be a factor leading to the observed difference in translation efficiency.  Regarding the effect on replication, the replication efficiency for CV777 DI was extremely low when compared with that for TW DI (≈20-fold difference) (Figure 4E) after 48 h of VP1. Sequencing analysis revealed that the leader sequence in CV777 DI was, in part, replaced by that of the helper virus TW strain, as a G at nt 8 and a U at nt 48 were identified. Except for the alterations in the leader sequence, no other changes in CV777 DI were found. It has been demonstrated that leader-switching occurred with a high frequency in the TRS region between DI RNA and the helper virus [43,44], and this may explain the replacement of the nts that occurred in the CV777 DI RNA leader sequence. Because it has been suggested that DI RNA is able to compete and recombine with the helper virus, such a nature may complicate the interpretation of the DI replication assay [45]. In the current study, it was found that the leader sequence of CV777 DI RNA was replaced by that of the helper virus, and consequently the recombination event may affect the quantitative results of the DI RNA replication assay. Whether the replication efficiency between wild-type CV777 and TW strain with full-length genome still shows a dramatic difference remains to be determined. Accordingly, at this point, we can only conclude that the variations in 5′ and 3′ UTRs between CV777 and TW may influence replication efficiency using the DI RNA system. Further study using PEDV reverse genetic system is required to determine to what extent the variations in 5′ and 3′ UTRs between the two strains affect replication efficiency.  3.5. Analyses of the TRS for CV777 and TW Strain  TRSs are cis-acting elements required for coronavirus sgmRNA synthesis that are located at the 3′ end of the leader sequence (TRS-L) and preceded by each gene (TRS-B). The TRS contains a CS flanked by variable sequences at its 5′ (5′ TRS) and 3′ (3′ TRS) ends of the CS. The CS of TRS-L (CS-L) in PEDV CV777 is CUAAAC. The CS of TRS-B (CS-B) for CV777 strain E, M, and N genes has been experimentally determined to be CUAGAC, AUAAAC, and CUAAAC, respectively [46] (Figure 5A, left panel for E, M, and N genes). Although the CS-B for the S and ORF3 genes for CV777 strain was previously assumed to be GUAAAC and CUAGAC, respectively [47] (Figure 5B,C, respectively, upper left panel), this has yet to be experimentally determined. In comparison with CV777, the CS-L of the TW strain was not altered, i.e., it was CUAAAC (Figure 1A). To determine the CS-B for TW, sgmRNA was amplified using RT-PCR followed by sequencing. The sequencing results were analyzed to identify the fusion sites in the genome with the 5′ end of the virus, by which the CS-B for the S, ORF3, E, M, and N genes was determined (Figure 5A, right panel). The results suggested that the CS-B for E, M, and N was the same for PEDV TW and CV777; however, the CS-B for S and ORF3 for TW was different from the previously assumed CS-Bs for CV777. Instead of the previously assumed GUAAAC for CV777 (Figure 5B, upper left panel), the CS-B for the TW S gene was CGUAAA (Figure 5B, upper right panel), which was located one nt upstream of previously assumed GUAAAC. Based on the study by Sola et al. that found that TRS is defined as consisting of the central CS and the four nts immediately 5′ (5′ TRS) and 3′ (3′ TRS) of the CS, the overall identity of the S TRS-B with TRS-L for CV777 was slightly lower than that for TW (8 for CV777 and 10 for TW; Figure 5B, upper panel). We speculate the reason why GUAAAC was previously assumed to be the CS-B for the CV777 S gene may be attributed to its higher sequence identity with CS-L in comparison with CGUAAA for TW (5 for CV777 and 3 for TW; Figure 5B, upper panel). However, the higher identity between the 5′ TRS-B and 5′ TRS-L (1 for CV777 and 4 for TW) and between the 3′ TRS-B and 3′ TRS-L (2 for CV777 and 3 for TW) may be a more decisive factor for the outcome based on CGUAAA being selected for TW. With regard to ORF3, CS-B CCUUAC for TW (Figure 5C, upper right panel), which was located 11 nts downstream of the previously assumed CUAGAC for CV777 (Figure 5C, upper left panel), was identified. The same reason as described above for the S gene CS-B may be involved, whereby the previously assumed CUAGAC of ORF3 for CV777 showed higher identity with the CS-L in comparison with that for TW while lower identity between the 5′ TRS-B and 5′ TRS-L (0 for CV777 and 4 for TW) and between the 3′ TRS-B and 3′ TRS-L (1 for CV777 and 3 for TW) is observed. Based on the argument above, it is currently assumed that the CS of TRS-B (CS-B) for CV777 strain S and ORF3 genes is CGUAAA (Figure 5A, left panel and Figure 5B, lower left panel) and CCUUAC (Figure 5A, left panel and Figure 5C, lower left panel), respectively; however, the exact CS-B of S and ORF3 genes for CV777 remains to be experimentally determined with RNA collected from CV777-infected cells.  3.6. Evaluation of the Effect of Variations in TRS between CV777 and TW Strains on sgmRNA Synthesis  According to the current study shown in Figure 1 and previous reports [3,18,19], in comparison with CV777, an A deletion at nt 73 immediately downstream of CS-L was frequently identified for PEDV, including the TW strain. It has been proposed that such a deletion immediately downstream of CS-L may have influence on PEDV sgmRNA synthesis [3,18,19], though further examination to support this hypothesis has been not performed. As the TRS is defined to consist of the central CS and the four nts immediately flanking the 5′ (5′ TRS) and 3′ (3′ TRS) CS [17] and based on the alignment shown in Figure 5A, the one-nt deletion immediately downstream of the CS-L in the TW strain (Figure 5A, right panel) results in increased identity for the 3′ TRS between TRS-B and TRS-L for S, ORF3, E, and M, but not N genes, in comparison with CV777 (Figure 5A, left panel). This was also true for comparison of the previously (Figure 4B,C, upper left panel) and currently (Figure 4B,C, lower left panel) assumed CS-B of S and ORF3 gene for CV777. Because the 3′ TRS has a more decisive influence on template-switching during sgmRNA synthesis [16,17], the increased identity of the 3′ TRS in these genes may enhance sgmRNA synthesis. Furthermore, it has been suggested that if the identity of the 5′ TRS and 3′ TRS of CS-B with those of CS-L reaches a plateau in G value, template-switching is able to occur for sgmRNA synthesis, even though CS-B exhibits low identity with CS-L [17]. Thus, in comparison with the TW strain, the decreased identity in the CV777 3′ TRS may have an influence on the synthesis of S, ORF3, and M sgmRNAs because their CS-Bs also have low identity with CS-L. Accordingly, in comparison with CV777, the increased sequence identity of the 3′ TRS between TRS-L and TRS-B of S, ORF3, E, and M (but not N) genes in TW may alter the relative efficiency of sgmRNA synthesis.  To determine whether the altered sequence identity between the leader TRS and body TRS (Figure 5) affected sgmRNA synthesis within the same context of the genome, the TRS-B for the S gene was inserted into TW DI (designated S-TRS; Figure 6A, right panel). In addition, ΔA S-TRS (Figure 6A, left panel) was also constructed, in which the 3′ TRS of the TRS-B for the S gene was mutated to decrease its sequence identity with the 3′ TRS of the TRS-L (Figure 6B). As shown in Figure 6C, the efficiency of subgenomic DI RNA synthesized from ΔA S-TRS was decreased in comparison with that from S-TRS. The results suggest that the increase in sequence identity between the leader TRS and body TRS leads to enhanced subgenomic mRNA synthesis, which is in agreement with our hypothesis. Indeed, these results were not unexpected based on previously published studies regarding the correlation of TRS sequence identity with sgmRNA synthesis [16,17,48,49,50]. However, it is the first study on the content of a PEDV genome demonstrating that the increased sequence identity between the leader TRS and body TRS enhances sgmRNA synthesis. The results also support the previously proposed hypothesis [3,18,19] that the increased 3′ TRS sequence identity between TRS-L and TRS-B in the TW strain caused by a deletion immediately downstream of CS-L has influence on PEDV sgmRNA synthesis. In conclusion, the results support our hypothesis that increased 3′ TRS sequence identity between TRS-L and TRS-B in the TW strain caused by a deletion immediately downstream of CS-L has an influence on PEDV sgmRNA synthesis.  Overall, we have determined that the cis-acting elements were altered in the PEDV TW strain and the reference strains (except the Thailand strain) in comparison with those of the PEDV prototype strain CV777. Functional analyses suggest that such variations in cis-acting elements for the TW strain compared with the CV777 strain have an influence on the efficiency of gene expression. Therefore, it is speculated that variations in cis-acting elements may also be one of the factors potentially contributing to the pathogenesis. Although the cis-acting elements of the Thailand reference strain are the same as those of the CV777 strain, we still cannot exclude the importance of the cis-acting elements because it is not clear whether the Thailand reference strain is virulent or not based on the insufficient information from GenBank. Accordingly, we also cannot rule out other factors that also play roles in the PED outbreak. Further study is required to determine to what extent the variations in cis-acting elements affect the virulence and pathogenesis using a reverse genetic system.

Figure 5  Alignment of identified fusion sites in the genome with the 5′ end of the CV777 strain (left panel) or TW strain (right panel). CS-B and CS-L are identified by shading. The identity of clustered base similarities within the 14-nt region (including the 4-nt 5′-TRS, 6-nt CS-B, and 4-nt 3′-TRS) immediately surrounding the CS-B is also shown. Nucleotide identity between sequences is indicated using an asterisk. The number of nt identity among the 4-nt 3′-TRS is indicated above the 3′-TRS. Postulated polymerase strand-switching during minus-strand synthesis is indicated by an arrow. Because the CS-B for the S and ORF3 genes for CV777 are unknown, the currently assumed CS-B for the two genes is shown in the left panel of (A). The previously (upper left panel) and currently (lower left panel) assumed CS-B for the S gene and ORF3 genes for CV777 is also used for the alignment, as shown in the left panel of (B) and (C), respectively.  Figure 6  Effect of sequence identity between TRS-L and TRS-B on the efficiency of sgmRNA synthesis. (A) Genome structure of the TW DI RNA with an insertion of the TRS for S gene. In constructing ΔA S-TRS, an A residue in the 3′ TRS was deleted (left panel); however, in constructing S-TRS, no deletion at the same position was created (right panel). (B) Based on sequence alignment, deletion of the A residue from the 3′ TRS led to 2-nt identity of the 3′ TRS between TRS-L and TRS-B (left panel). In contrast, without the A residue deletion, three nts of the 3′ TRS are identical between TRS-L and TRS-B in constructing S-TRS (right panel).

Conclusions  In this study, we found variations in cis-acting elements in the 5′ and 3′ UTRs between the PEDV TW and prototype CV777 strains. We also determined the previously unidentified cis-acting element TRS and found that (i) a nucleotide deletion in the TW strain, in comparison with CV777 strain, immediately downstream of the leader core sequence alters the identity between the leader TRS and the body TRS, and (ii) the altered sequence identity has influence on coronavirus subgenomic mRNA synthesis. Functional analyses revealed that such variations in the 5′ and 3′ UTRs of the TW strain also alter the efficiency of gene expression in comparison with that of the CV777 strain. Because the analyzed cis-acting elements for the TW strain are the same as those of the reference strains for USA and Korea, our results may extend our understanding of PEDV evolution in terms of cis-acting elements and the recent outbreaks of PED worldwide. Further study using reverse genetic system is required to determine whether the altered gene expression is associated with the increased severity of the recent PED outbreaks. In addition, a putative ORF within the 3′ UTR and a BSL structure within the putative ORF were also found. The biological significance of the ORF and BSL structure remains to be experimentally demonstrated.  ",FALSE,TRUE,
PMC6316102,Abstract,Abstract,DQ811788,0,0,0,,,"  In 2013, the outbreak of porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) in Taiwan caused serious economic losses. In this study, we examined whether the variations of the cis-acting elements between the porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) Taiwan (TW) strain and the prototype strain CV777 alter gene expression. For this aim, we analyzed the variations of the cis-acting elements in the 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions (UTRs) between the PEDV TW, CV777, and other reference strains. We also determined the previously unidentified transcription regulatory sequence (TRS), a sequence motif required for coronavirus transcription, and found that a nucleotide deletion in the TW strain, in comparison with CV777 strain, immediately downstream of the leader core sequence alters the identity between the leader TRS and the body TRS. Functional analyses using coronavirus defective interfering (DI) RNA revealed that such variations in cis-acting elements for the TW strain compared with the CV777 strain have an influence on the efficiency of gene expression. The current data show for the first time the evolution of PEDV in terms of cis-acting elements and their effects on gene expression, and thus may contribute to our understanding of recent PED outbreaks worldwide.

The diversified virion morphotypes and genome contents of archaeal viruses result in a highly complex array of archaea-virus interactions. However, our understanding of archaeal antiviral activities lags far behind our knowledges of those in bacteria. Here we report a new archaeal defence system that involves DndCDEA-specific DNA phosphorothioate (PT) modification and the PbeABCD-mediated halt of virus propagation via inhibition of DNA replication. In contrast to the breakage of invasive DNA by DndFGH in bacteria, DndCDEA-PbeABCD does not degrade or cleave viral DNA. The PbeABCD-mediated PT defence system is widespread and exhibits extensive interdomain and intradomain gene transfer events. Our results suggest that DndCDEA-PbeABCD is a new type of PT-based virus resistance system, expanding the known arsenal of defence systems as well as our understanding of host-virus interactions.  The prokaryote defence system Dnd relies on phosphorothioation (PT) of DNA backbone to distinguish between self and non-self DNA. Here, Xiong et al. describe a previously uncharacterized PT-based antiviral system that is independent of the canonical Dnd and is widespread in Archaea and Bacteria.

""","  Discussion  In this study, we describe a new type of PT-based multi-gene antiviral system in Archaea, DndCDEA-PbeABCD, that is genetically and phenotypically distinct from DndBCDE-DndFGH. In spite of the absence of the transcriptional repressor DndB, the DndCDEA-PbeABCD system in four haloarchaeal strains drives motif-specific DNA PT modifications at frequencies comparable to those observed in Bacteria32,34. Approximately half of PT sites occur in the form of hemi-PT-modified 5ʹ-GPSATC-3ʹ/5ʹ-GATC-3ʹ in Archaea, which is in sharp contrast to the predominant full PT modifications that occur in Bacteria32,34. However, although PbeABCD allows viral adsorption and DNA injection into the host archaeal cells, it prevents viral DNA replication in a PT-dependent manner. Notably, the DndCDEA-PbeABCD pair was no longer able to protect against a PT-modified SNJ1 virus, suggesting a strategy of utilising epigenetic modification for self/non-self discrimination. We therefore speculated that PbeABCD serves as the REase component to target non-PT-modified viral DNA, analogous to R-M systems. However, two lines of evidence point to a novel mechanism of defence that is different from type II R-M systems, which have autonomous REase and MTase activities, and PT-based DndFGH systems. First, no sign of the processive degradation or cleavage of viral DNA was detected in the presence of DndCDEA-PbeABCD. Second, in typical R-M or DndFGH-mediated Dnd systems, the loss of methylation or PT would be detrimental to cells because the resulting host DNA would be recognised as invading foreign DNA and be attacked by REases or DndFGH. However, dndCDEA deletion mutants exhibited no apparent growth defect compared to CJ7-F cells expressing intact dndCDEA-pbeABCD, although protection against the virus was lost.  We also showed that all four genes in the pbeABCD module appear to be essential for protection against viral infection. PbeA consists of a PLD domain35, a Res subunit of Type III REase domain and a helicase domain39,40, suggesting that it has multiple enzymatic activities. The PLD domain is present in a wide variety of enzymes involved in phospholipid metabolism, virulence, membrane remodelling and signalling35. In addition, it is also recognised as a characteristic of a small family of endonucleases in bacteria, such as Nuc, CglI, NgoAvII, BfiI and DrmC, a component of the newly identified multi-gene R-M module DISARM2,41–43. The Res subunit of Type III REase (i.e., EcoP15I) is a fusion between a DEAD-family helicase, correlating with the DNA translocation activity, and a nuclease resembling the functionally related HsdR subunit of the type I REases39,40. Nonetheless, the PD-X-D/EXK motif, the nuclease active site for DNA cleavage, is not present in PbeA, which is consistent with the non-DNA-cleavage defensive activity of PbeABCD. Based on the shared helicase motifs between PbeA and type I and III REases, we, speculate that PbeA might be associated with DNA translocation, looping or sliding to target DNA recognition sites. This possibility would explain why without pbeA, the remaining pbeBCD still confer a low-level of resistance to SNJ1. While pbeB and pbeD encode proteins of unknown function sized only 66 and 152 aa, respectively, deletions of them still completely abolished protection against virus SNJ1. Considering their small size, we speculate that PbeB and PbeD might become part of an enzyme complex for stabilisation or functional coupling. Notably, PbeC exhibits sequence resemblance to the structural maintenance of chromosome (SMC) protein (24% identity and 42% similarity) in Hydrococcus rivularis. SMC proteins adopt a V-shaped, two-armed architecture with an ATP-binding cassette (ABC)-like domain at the distal end of each arm and are recognised as one of the most fundamental classes of proteins involving in chromosome segregation, recombinational repair and genome-wide gene regulation (Supplementary Data 5)44. Although the function and interaction of PbeABCD proteins remain to be further elucidated, these preliminary clues indicate a possible mechanism of action whereby viral DNA molecules are manipulated in a certain manner to inhibit viral replication and propagation. In terms of the PT dependence, we speculate that Pbe protein(s) might sense PT DNA to function or that PbeABCD rely on PT to form an active assembly.  It was interesting to observe the potential HGT events of DndCD between different bacterial phyla, as well as between Archaea and Bacteria. However, based on the phenomenon that DndFGH occurs only in Bacteria and not in Archaea, this interdomain HGT situation does not hold for the restriction component DndFGH. Instead, the PT modifications in Archaea have evolved to be paired with PbeABCD, generating a new type of PT-based defence module with mechanisms of action that differ from those of DndFGH. In addition, PbeABCD-mediated PT defence pairs are also widespread among Bacteria. Further phylogenetic analysis of PbeAC revealed two unusual observations: (1) 320 of 553 pbeAC are solitary, lacking the counterpart PT modification dnd genes; and (2) pbeAC, dndFGH and PT modification genes coexist in 25 bacterial strains. Regarding the occurrence of solitary pbeAC, it is possible that they are not functional due to their dependence on PT. This scenario is different from that of the REases in type I and III R-M systems, which are activated via protein–protein interactions with the cognate MTases to enable their restriction activity. At present, we still cannot rule out the possibility that PbeABCD has evolved to pair with other modification counterparts, such as MTases, to generate new defensive modules, which is supported by the observation that 155 of 320 solitary pbeAC components are in close proximity to genes encoding MTases. In terms of the coexistence of DndFGH, PbeABCD and PT modifications, it is currently unclear whether the first two are both functional or which one pairs with PT or methylation as a defensive module, emphasising the possibility of complicated interactions worthy of future investigation.  In the host–parasite coevolutionary arms race, viruses have developed a variety of counter-resistance tactics to circumvent the arsenal of prokaryotic resistance mechanisms5. Considering that the PT-modified SNJ1 virus can bypass PbeABCD-mediated PT defence systems, we can speculate that once the virus completes an infection cycle, the resulting SNJ1 progeny possessing PT modifications would overcome this defence in other archaeal and bacterial cells, regardless of the presence of PbeABCD or DndFGH. Thus, in future studies, it would be interesting to identify viruses with naturally occurring PT modifications or to explore other strategies used by viruses to avoid, circumvent or subvert PT-based defence systems.  Owing to the fairly limited number of archaeal host–virus systems studied, our understanding of archaeal host–virus interactions lags far behind our understanding of those in Bacteria. These limitations also hinder the exploration of new defensive mechanisms in Archaea. In this study, we identified a new type of PT-based Dnd defence system that is widespread in Archaea and Bacteria. The antiviral activity of PbeABCD depends on the presence of DNA PT modification but does not involve viral DNA degradation or cleavage, ruling out the involvement of currently known defence mechanisms. These findings expand our knowledge regarding the arsenal of archaeal defence systems and illuminate the archaeal host–virus arms race.  ",FALSE,TRUE,

PMC6459918,Introduction,Introduction,CP031298,1,0,0,1,"""In this study, we first identify PT modifications in halophilic and methanogenic archaea that show diverse sequence specificities and abundance comparable to those observed in bacteria.""","  Introduction  Viruses are the most abundant biological entities in the biosphere and are estimated to outnumber their bacterial and archaeal hosts by tenfold. The constant threat of virus predation has led to the evolution of diverse defence mechanisms that target nearly every stage of the viral infectious cycle. These mechanisms involve inhibiting adsorption, blocking viral DNA injection, restriction-modification (R-M), limiting phage growth, toxin-antitoxin systems, abortive infection and CRISPR/Cas systems, as well as the newly discovered prokaryotic Argonaute, BREX, DISARM, Zorya and Dnd defence systems1–6.  Among these mechanisms, the use of R-M systems is the most prevalent and best-characterised antiviral approach among Bacteria and Archaea. Generally, R-M systems consist of two contrasting enzymatic activities: (1) a methyltransferase (MTase) that catalyses the transfer of a methyl group to DNA nucleobases within a particular sequence motif of ‘self’ DNA and (2) a restriction endonuclease (REase) cognate that identifies and destroys invading foreign DNA that harbours the same DNA motif when not methylated. Four major types of R-M systems (I, II, III and IV) are classified based on their subunit composition, cofactor requirements, sequence recognition and cleavage mechanisms7. Type I R-M systems comprise three subunits, R (restriction), M (modification) and S (specificity), and the resulting complex binds to a bipartite sequence and requires ATP hydrolysis to cleave at a distant site following DNA translocations8. Type II systems are the simplest, which contain separate MTase and REase enzymes to act independently. Type III systems are multifunctional oligomeric proteins consisting of a Mod and a Res subunit. The Mod subunit alone can function independently as a MTase to recognise non-palindromic sequences, only one strand of which can be methylated, whereas the Res subunit needs to pair with the Mod subunit for restriction activity9. Type IV systems have no methylase activity and type IV REases recognise and cleave only modified DNA10–12. Although type I–III R-M systems are tremendously diverse, the associated DNA modifications most commonly occur in the form of methylation of nucleobase moieties, such as N6-methyl-adenine, N4-methyl-cytosine and C5-methyl-cytosine.  The Dnd defence system has recently been recognised as a new component of the bacterial innate immune system, in which phosphorothioate (PT) modification is used as a marker to distinguish between self and non-self DNA, analogous to methylation-based R-M systems13,14. In contrast to DNA methylation at nucleobases, PT modification occurs on the DNA sugar-phosphate backbone, where replacement of the non-bridging oxygen by sulphur confers nuclease resistance at the PT linkage13,15. The Dnd system is organised into three parts: (1) DndACDE proteins form a complex and act as the modification component to catalyse DNA PT modification in a sequence-selective manner16,17; (2) DndB is a transcriptional repressor capable of regulating expression of the dndBCDE cluster and the resulting PT level18 and (3) DndFGH proteins function as the R component to recognise and destroy non-PT-modified foreign DNA14,19. All three dndFGH genes are essential to distinguish and restrict the transformation of non-PT-modified incoming plasmid DNA in Salmonella enterica4. Once PT modification is abolished, S. enterica suffers double-stranded DNA damage from the unrestrained restriction activity of DndFGH, which consequently leads to growth defects and triggers the SOS response14,20. Although the enzymatic activities and mechanism of action of DndFGH is currently unclear, these features resemble the well-characterised ‘self/non-self discrimination’ strategy of methylation-based R-M systems.  To prevent REase attack on resident DNA, the recognition motifs are generally nearly completely methylated by the MTase counterpart. However, this situation is not observed for Dnd defence systems. Indeed, only 4855 of 40,701 complementary 5ʹ-GAAC-3ʹ/5ʹ-GTTC-3ʹ consensus sequences found in the Escherichia coli B7A genome are PT modified to 5ʹ-GPSAAC-3ʹ/5ʹ-GPSTTC-3ʹ (PS: phosphate-sulphur linkage), even in the presence of active DndFGH, ruling out the known R-M mechanisms.  Although the number of described archaeal viruses accounts for only 1% of all reported prokaryotic viruses, the archaeal viruses exhibit enormously diversified morphotypes and genome contents21–24. Many of the unique morphologies of archaeal viruses, including coil-shaped, bottle-shaped, spherical and droplet-shaped with beard-like fibres, have not been observed among bacterial or eukaryotic viruses21. Consistent with the uniqueness of viral morphotypes, the genome contents of these archaeal viruses are distinctive, with ~75% of genes encoding functionally unknown proteins25. Although the current knowledge of archaeal viruses has merely touched the tip of the iceberg, one may imagine the development of diverse defence systems during the coevolutionary arms race between archaea and viruses given the distinct morphological and genomic properties of viruses.  Indeed, as in Bacteria, an astonishing array of defence systems have developed among Archaea to restrict invasive viruses and plasmids. For example, 96% of the sequenced bacterial genomes harbour R-M systems, while 384 (98%) of the 390 currently available archaeal genomes encode R-M systems (http://rebase.neb.com/rebase/rebase.html)26, as of the time of writing of this manuscript. However, only a few archaeal R-M systems have been investigated to date, including R.PabI from the hyperthermophilic Pyrococcus abyssi, R.PspGI from Pyrococcus sp. strain GI-H, R.SuaI from the thermoacidophilic Sulfolobus acidocaldarius and their cognate MTases27–30. Moreover, archaea wrap their DNA into histone-DNA complexes with the same geometry as DNA in the eukaryotic nucleosomes31, prompting us to investigate the aspects of PT modification and PT-related functions in Archaea.  In this study, we first identify PT modifications in halophilic and methanogenic archaea that show diverse sequence specificities and abundance comparable to those observed in bacteria. However, no trace of the restriction component DndFGH is detected in any of the archaeal strains assessed. Instead, we report that PT-modification genes, such as dndCDEA in the halophilic archaeon Haloterrigena jeotgali A29, can defend against viral attack together with pbeABCD, a conserved 4-gene cassette sharing no sequence homology with DndFGH. Moreover, the defence mechanism involves the DndCDEA-mediated PT modification of the self-DNA sequence and the use of PbeABCD to halt virus propagation by inhibiting DNA replication in a PT-dependent manner. Unlike the DndFGH-mediated defence mechanism, DndCDEA-PbeABCD does not function through the degradation or cleavage of viral DNA, highlighting a novel mode of action that is distinct from R-M activity and expanding the arsenal of known defence systems, as well as our understanding of host–virus interactions.

Natrinema sp. CJ7-F and its derivative strains were cultured in Halo-2 or minimal medium (MM, 18%) at 45 °C, as previously described45. H. jeotgali A29, H. limi JCM 16811 and H. salinum JCM 19729 were cultivated in JCM medium 402, and N. bangense JCM 10635 was grown in JCM medium 167. To construct plasmids, E. coli strains were routinely grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium at 37 °C. To prepare solid agar medium, agar was added to the medium to a final concentration of 15 g/L. When necessary, ampicillin was added to the medium at a concentration of 100 μg/mL.  Construction and expression of pWHU3808 and derivatives  The shuttle vector pFJ6-H was used to express dndCDEA-pbeABCD from H. jeotgali A29 and its derivatives in CJ7-F45. Plasmid pWHU3808, expressing the complete dndCDEA-pbeABCD module, was constructed in two steps. First, the dndCDEA and pbeABCD fragments were PCR amplified from H. jeotgali A29 genomic DNA using the primer pairs dndCDEA-pYC-F/dndCDEA-pYC-R and pbeABCD-F/pbeABCD-R, respectively. The fragments were inserted into the SnaBI-HindIII-digested pYCJ-HH and NotI-SphI-digested pFJ6-H, yielding pWHU3253 and pWHU3804, respectively. Second, the heat-shock protein 70 (HSP 70) promoter and the dndCDEA fusion fragments were PCR amplified from pWHU3253 using the primer pair Hpro-dndCDEA-F/Hpro-dndCEDA-R. The PCR product was then ligated into pWHU3804 digested with NdeI and KpnI, yielding pWHU3808. For the in-frame deletion of pbeA in pWHU3808, a 5.2 kb fragment containing the downstream portion of pbeA was first generated by PCR using the primer pair ΔpbeA-F/ΔpbeA-R from pWHU3808 (Supplementary Table 4). The PCR products and the NdeI-NotI digested pWHU3808, sharing 25–30 bp identical sequences, were mixed to allow site-specific recombination using a Hieff Clone™ Plus One Step Cloning Kit (Yeasen), generating plasmid pWHU3813. To generate the in-frame deletion of pbeB in pWHU3808, the upstream and downstream fragments of pbeB were PCR amplified using the primer pairs ΔpbeB-UF/ΔpbeB-UR and ΔpbeB-DF/ΔpbeB-DR, respectively (Supplementary Table 4). The two purified PCR products and the NdeI-NotI-digested pWHU3808 were mixed according to the manufacturer’s instructions for recombination to generate the plasmid pWHU3814. The procedures used to construct the other pWHU3808-derived plasmids expressing in-frame deletions of the dnd genes were similar to those used for pWHU3814. All of the recombinant plasmids were verified by sequencing. The transformation of CJ7-F was performed at room temperature using the polyethylene glycol (PEG) method, as previously described38. MM (18%) medium was used to select and propagate CJ7-F transformants.  Absorption assay  CJ7-F cells expressing or lacking dndCDEA-pbeABCD were grown in Halo-2 medium to an OD600 of 0.3, followed by infection with virus SNJ1 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1. During infection, the archaeal cells and virus were incubated with shaking at 45 °C. Aliquots of 1 mL of culture were withdrawn at time points 1, 60, 120, 180, 240 and 300 min post infection, and the cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 1 min. The unabsorbed SNJ1 concentration in the upper aqueous phase was determined on CJ7-F cell lawns. The percentage of unabsorbed (extracellular) virus SNJ1 was calculated assuming the initial titre of SNJ1 (without added cells) to be 100%.  Determination of relative SNJ1 levels in CJ7-F hosts  CJ7-F cells harbouring pWHU3808 or the empty vector pFJ6-H, expressing or lacking dndCDEA-pbeABCD, respectively, were cultured in 20 mL of Halo-2 medium until the cell density reached an OD600 of 0.3. Logarithmic-phase cultures were infected with the SNJ1 virus at an MOI of 1. Multiple 1-mL samples of the cultures were collected at the indicated time point by centrifugation, and the cells were resuspended in 100 μL of basal salt solution (medium without a carbon source). Total DNA from CJ7-F strains containing the different vectors was prepared as described previously46. Briefly, cells resuspended in 100 μL of basal salt solution were lysed after the addition of 900 μL of distilled water. The lysate was diluted 1:100 with distilled water and then was used as the template for real-time qPCR. The levels of the single-copy gene radA38, located on the chromosome of the host strain, and repA, located in the genome of SNJ1, were determined by real-time qPCR to estimate the relative intracellular levels of SNJ1 DNA relative to the CJ7-F chromosome during infection.  RNA extraction and reverse transcription  Total RNA was extracted from the H. jeotgali A29 strain using an Omega RNA Extraction Kit (Omega Bio-Tec) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Next, the RNA samples were treated with DNase I (Thermo Fisher) to remove residual genomic DNA, and the RNA was then quantified using a NanoDrop2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher). The RNA was reverse transcribed using a RevertAid First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Fermentas) to obtain cDNA.  SNJ1 propagation and isolation  The haloarchaeal virus SNJ1 was propagated in Natrinema sp. J7-145. The J7-1 strain was grown at 45 °C in Halo-2 medium to late log phase (OD600 = 0.8–1.0), after which mitomycin C (Roche) was added to the cultures at a final concentration of 1 μg/mL, followed by overnight incubation at 37 °C with shaking at 200 rpm. The cultures were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 20 min to remove cellular debris, and the supernatants were subsequently filtered through 0.22-µm Millipore pore membrane filters. When necessary, a PEG6000 solution was used to concentrate the phage preparations, as described previously47.  Plaque assays  Halovirus plaque assays were performed as described previously48, with slight modifications. Briefly, the CJ7-F derivative strains were grown at 45 °C in 18% MM medium to late log phase (OD600 = ~0.8–1.0). Next, an aliquot (400 µL) of the culture was mixed with molten soft agar (0.6%) and poured onto Halo-2 agar plates (1.5%). Once solidified, 5 μL of serial tenfold dilutions of SNJ1 were pipetted onto the agar. The plates were incubated for 36 h at 45 °C, and the phage titres were calculated as PFU (plaque-forming unit)/mL.  Southern blot analysis  CJ7-F cells possessing pWHU3808 and pFJ6-H were incubated with the SNJ1 virus at an MOI of 5. Multiple aliquots of 10 mL of culture were collected at different time points (1, 5, 10, 15, 30 min and 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 h) post infection. In addition, samples of the cultures prior to the addition of SNJ1 were used as negative controls. Total genomic DNA was extracted and digested with SacI for Southern blot analysis. The primers SNJ1-southern-F and SNJ1-southern-R were designed to synthesise a probe corresponding to the region from 9243 to 9732 nt of the SNJ1 genome (Supplementary Table 4). The DNA probe preparation, hybridisation and detection were performed using a Detection Starter Kit II (Roche) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.  Bioinformatic and statistical analysis  Using the DndC, DndD, PbeA and PbeC protein sequences from H. jeotgali A29 and the DndF, DndG, and DndH sequences from S. enterica serovar Cerro 87 and Hahella chejuensis KCTC 2396 as BLAST queries, we searched the NCBI databases of non-redundant nucleotide collections, RefSeq_genomes, WGS, HTGS, refseq_genomic, and GSS. The BLAST hits were filtered using an e-value of ≤10−10 and an aligned length of ≥30% to the query sequences. The distance between dndC and dndD was limited to 5 kb or less. Flanking regions of ±20 kb around the dndCD cluster were searched for the presence of pbeA, pbeC, dndF, dndG and dndH. Similarly, we searched for genes encoding MTases or DndCD within close proximity (1 bp–10 kb) to pbeAC.  The sequences used to generate the phylogenetic trees were formed by concatenating the protein sequences of DndC and DndD, and PbeA and PbeC. Multiple alignments were performed using MEGA 5.2 with the MUSCLE algorithm. The parameters were set as follows: gap open = −2.9, gap extend = 0, hydrophobicity multiplier = 1.2, max iterations = 8, and min dialogue length = 24, and the UPGMB method was used for clustering. Trees were constructed using the maximum likelihood method with 500 bootstrap replications. The other parameters were set as follows: substitution type = amino acid, substitution model = Jones-Taylor-Thornton model, rates among sites = uniform rates, gaps/missing data treatment = complete deletion, maximum likelihood heuristic method = Nearest-Neighbour-Interchange, and the neighbour-joining method was used to constructed the initial tree. The output trees were visualised by iTOL49.  DndCD and PbeAC sequences wereglobally aligned with those of H. jeotgali A29 using the needle programme in the EMBOSS package50. Similarity values were extracted from the output files. The coevolution analysis has been described in detail previously34. Generally, we regressed the similarity values of PbeAC to those of DndCD to explore their coevolution on the basis of the idea that the divergence degree (i.e., 1 minus the similarity rate) of PbeAC and DndCD from their respective ancestor should be linearly related in a given strain, if they evolve at the same speed. The same regression analysis was also performed on DndCD and DndFGH. As H. jeotgali A29 lacks dndFGH, global alignments were made with the sequence data from S. enterica serovar Cerro 87.

In this study, we first identified DNA PT modifications in five archaea with homologous PT-modification genes. Based on mass spectral analysis, nuclease-resistant PT-linked dinucleotides were produced upon enzymatic hydrolysis of archaeal DNA (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. 1). The following strains were observed to harbour PT-modified d(GPSA): three halophilic archaeal strains, H. jeotgali A29, isolated from salt-fermented shrimp jeotgal, and Halapricum salinum JCM 19729 and Halobellus limi JCM 16811, isolated from solar salterns in Korea and China, respectively; and one haloalkaliphilic archaeal strain, Natronorubrum bangense JCM 10635, isolated from a soda lake in Tibet. H. limi JCM 16811 also possesses a detectable level of d(GPSG). An acidophilic methanogen, Methanoregula boonei 6A8, isolated from an acid peat bog in the United States, also shows PT modification at d(GPSA) and d(GPSG) of the same order of magnitude (Table 1). These findings reveal the diversity of PT consensus sequences among Archaea. Next, we determined that the dndCDEA operon of H. jeotgali A29 was capable of conferring d(GPSA) modification upon transfer to a new host, Natrinema sp. CJ7-F, an extreme haloarchaeon without endogenous dnd genes (Supplementary Fig. 1).Fig. 1Maximum likelihood phylogeny of 2642 homologues of the H. jeotgali A29 DndCD identified in Archaea and Bacteria. The strain names of 42 archaea, as well as the phosphorothioate (PT) sequence contexts identified in this study are displayed as noted. Each prokaryotic phylum is represented in a distinct colour (see the legend). Bacterial strain names are also provided in Supplementary Data 1.

Source data are provided as a Source Data fileNA, not applicableaIndicates that the PT-linked dinucleotides were detected but were below the limit of quantification  We next used the DndCD protein sequences (DndE is too small to be annotated in some genomes) of H. jeotgali A29 as a query to explore the occurrence and diversity of Dnd systems across archaeal genomes. Using BLAST, we searched the homologues of DndCD in the NCBI databases of non-redundant nucleotide collections (nt), RefSeq Genome (refseq_genomes), whole-genome shotgun contigs (WGS), high-throughput genomic sequences (HTGS), reference genomic sequences (refseq_genomic), and genomic survey sequences (GSS). We filtered the results based on an e-value of ≤ 10−10 and discarded BLAST hits with aligned lengths of ≤ 30% of the query proteins. A total of 2642 occurrences of dndCD were identified nested within 2600 bacterial and 42 archaeal genomes (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Data 1). The 42 Archaea harbouring DndCD homologues span the phylogenetic diversity of archaeal lineages, including Methanomicrobia (23), Haloarchaea (7), Thaumarchaeota (6), Bathyarchaeota (2), Thermoplasmata (2), and Heimdallarchaeota (1), as well as an uncultured marine group II/III euryarchaeote KM3_173_A11 (Supplementary Data 1). According to the phylogenetic tree of the 2642 DndCD proteins (archaeal and bacterial DndCD proteins), the archaeal strains do not phylogenetically cluster together but instead are grouped with bacteria, suggesting potential interdomain HGT of Dnd systems between Archaea and Bacteria (Fig. 1).  Genome-wide PT features in Archaea  In contrast to the well-characterised dndBCDE cluster in bacterial genomes, dndCDEA clusters in H. jeotgali A29, N. bangense JCM 10635, H. limi JCM 16811 and H. salinum JCM 19729 are not accompanied by dndB, which encodes a negative regulator that binds to the promoter region of the dndBCDE operon. Upon relief of DndB repression, the transcription of dndBCDE and the resulting PT frequency increased by 15- and 2-fold, respectively, in the bacterial strain S. enterica serovar Cerro 8718. However, in the four haloarchaeal strains, we observed d(GPSA) at an average frequency of ~2–3 PT per 104 nt, which is comparable to the frequency of ~3–8 PT per 104 nt detected in bacteria16, prompting us to examine the PT features across the archaeal genomes (Table 1).  To this end, we exploited the single-molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing platform to profile the genome-wide PT sites32,33. The SMRT sequencing data immediately revealed the occurrence of d(GPSA) in a 4-bp consensus sequence of 5ʹ-GPSATC-3ʹ in all four haloarchaea genomes (Supplementary Fig. 2). Only 2.6% (2451) out of 94,316, 2.1% (1614) out of 75,884, 2.4% (1442) out of 60,776, and 1.4% (895) out of 64,824 5ʹ-GATC-3ʹ sites in H. jeotgali A29, N. bangense JCM 10635, H. limi JCM 16811 and H. salinum JCM 19729 were detected to be PT modified, respectively (Supplementary Data 2). Although no further sequence constraint beyond the 4-bp 5ʹ-GPSATC-3ʹ was identified, we observed sequence biases for PT modification-proximate bases, with a noticeable preference for 5ʹ-tGPSATCc-3ʹ but an underrepresentation at 5ʹ-gGPSATC(g/t)-3ʹ (Supplementary Table 1). No PT enrichment in particular DNA regions was observed across all four archaeal genomes (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Data 2). For instance, 1229 and 1222 5ʹ-GPSATC-3ʹ sites were observed to be located on the (+) and (−) strands of the H. jeotgali A29 genome, respectively, with various spacing ranging from 4 to 36 kb. In addition, 915 out of 4745 open reading frames, 8 out of 13 rRNA genes and 31 out of 200 pseudogenes in H. jeotgali A29 harbour at least one PT site (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Data 2). While 1310 of 2451, 674 of 1614, 736 of 1442, and 244 of 895 genomic PTs were detected to be fully PT-modified (on both strands) 5ʹ-GPSATC-3ʹ/5ʹ-GPSATC-3ʹ in H. jeotgali A29, N. bangense JCM 10635, H. limi JCM 16811 and H. salinum JCM 19729, respectively, up to 47% (1141), 58% (940), 49% (706), and 73% (651) of PT sites occur in the form of hemimodified 5ʹ-GPSATC-3ʹ/5ʹ-GATC-3ʹ (Supplementary Fig. 2). These results are in sharp contrast to the predominant full PT modification found in 5ʹ-GPSAAC-3ʹ/5ʹ-GPSTTC-3 in E. coli B7A32 and 5ʹ-GPSGCC-3ʹ/5ʹ-GPSGCC-3ʹ in Pseudomonas fluorescens pf0–134, suggesting different PT physiologies among Archaea. Additionally, it was interesting to observe the presence of DNA methylation in a variety of sequence contexts, including 5ʹ-TCCGA6mA-3ʹ, 5ʹ-GAGG6mAG-3ʹ, 5ʹ-C6mATTC-3ʹ, 5ʹ-CAG6mATG-3ʹ, and 5ʹ-CG6mATCC-3ʹ, by SMRT sequencing (Supplementary Table 2), which indicated their potential involvement in methylation-based R-M defence systems, epigenetic regulation, or other biological functions in Archaea.Fig. 2Phosphorothioate (PT) mapping across the genomes of H. jeotgali A29, N. bangense JCM 10635, H. salinum JCM 19729 and H. limi JCM 16811.

Source data are provided as a Source Data file  DndCDEA constitutes a novel antiviral system with PbeABCD  Based on these PT characteristics in Archaea, we sought to explore the genomic neighbourhoods of dndCD by selecting 2361 out of 2642 archaeal and bacterial dndCD with available flanking sequence data. The restriction component dndFGH was observed to be in close proximity (1 bp-20 kb) with 48.8% (1132) of the 2322 bacterial dndCD regions, agreeing well with our previous observations34. Conversely, no trace of dndFGH was observed within the vicinity of all 39 archaeal dndCD. Instead, the majority of these archaeal dndCD clusters are followed by a four-gene cassette arranged in a highly conserved order (Fig. 3).Fig. 3The diversity of phosphorothioate (PT) systems in prokaryotes. a The genetic organisation and gene orders of the PT-based PbeABCD and DndFGH systems are displayed. GenBank accession numbers for pbeABCD in H. jeotgali A29 are indicated. b The phylogenetic tree of 2361 archaeal and bacterial DndCD homologues is colour-coded by phylogenetic group (see the legend). Strains shaded violet, pink, black and green have DndCD homologues associated with PbeABCD, DndFGH, DndFGH-PbeABCD, or none, respectively. The widths of tree branches are proportional to their Bootstrap scores. For clarity, at least one familiar genus per colour segment were labelled. Source data are provided as a Source Data file  Using the gene cassette consisting of DVR14_03960, DVR14_03955, DVR14_03950 and DVR14_03945 in H. jeotgali A29 as an example, the four genes are co-expressed as a single transcriptional unit, consistent with the idea that they are functional related (Supplementary Fig. 3). DVR14_03960 comprises three domains: a phospholipase D (PLD)-like domain (pfam13091), a res subunit of Type III REase (pfam04851) and a DEAD (Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp)-family helicase C-terminal (pfam00271) domain (Supplementary Fig. 4). The PLD domain has been identified as a component of a large superfamily of proteins associated with the hydrolysis of phosphodiester bonds, such as phospholipases, kinases, toxins and REases35. The genes DVR14_03955 and DVR14_03945 encode proteins of unknown function with only 66 and 152 aa in size, respectively. DVR14_03950 contains an N-terminal AAA domain (ATPases associated with diverse cellular activities; pfam13476), a domain that is present in a wide variety of proteins that often direct molecular remodelling events in an ATP-driven process36. Given the positioning of these genes relative to dndCDEA and the predicted nuclease-related functions of their encoded proteins, we speculated that this four-gene cluster may constitute a new defence system involving DNA PT modification in Archaea, and we named the four genes pbeABCD (for phosphorothioate-blocked DNA exclusion).  To explore the involvement of pbeABCD in archaeal host–virus interactions, we cloned the dndCDEA-pbeABCD fragment from H. jeotgali A29 into the shuttle vector pFJ6-H, generating pWHU3808, followed by transformation into Natrinema sp. CJ7-F, a pyrF-deletion and plasmid-free derivative of Natrinema sp. J7-1 (Supplementary Table 3). We next challenged CJ7-F cells expressing dndCDEA-pbeABCD with the halophilic temperate sphaerolipovirus SNJ1. Using a double agar overlay plaque assay, we showed that dndCDEA-pbeABCD provided protection against SNJ1: the ability of SNJ1 to induce plaques was reduced ~104-fold (Fig. 4).Fig. 4DndCDEA-PbeABCD confers protection against the haloarchaeal virus SNJ1. a The dndCDEA-pbeABCD locus of H. jeotgali A29 is displayed. b Five microlitres each of a tenfold serial dilution (106–101) of SNJ1 virus was spotted onto CJ7-F cells carrying pWHU3808-derived plasmids and expressing the genes indicated on the left. The EOPs are listed on the right. The EOPs were determined by dividing the SNJ1 titre obtained by plating on CJ7-F expressing dndCDEA-pbeABCD and derivatives by the titre of SNJ1 plated on CJ7-F(pFJ6-H). The values represent the mean ± SD for three independent experiments. ****p-value < 0.0001, using one-sample t-test (Hypothesis Testing). Ns, not significant. Compared to the strong protection against non-PT SNJ1, CJ7-F cells are susceptible to PT-modified SNJ1, even in the presence of DndCDEA-PbeABCD. Source data are provided as a Source Data file  To further examine the components that are essential for this antiviral activity, we constructed a series of pWHU3808-derived plasmids (pWHU3813~pWHU3816), each expressing DNA PT modification, as well as the individual in-frame deleted genes of the pbeABCD cassette (Supplementary Table 3). Deletion of the individual pbeABCD genes impaired protection against SNJ1, indicating that all four pbe genes are indispensable for mediating antiviral activity (Fig. 4). It is noteworthy that the contributions of four pbe genes against SNJ1 are not equal. To quantify the protection, we measured the efficiency of plating (EOP) of SNJ1 applied to CJ7-F cells expressing different parts of the pbeABCD cassette. In contrast to the absolute necessity of pbeB, pbeC and pbeD, CJ7-F cells expressing dndCDEA-ΔpbeA-pbeBCD still exhibited a low-level of resistance, although less than one order of magnitude, against SNJ1, suggesting that pbeA is partially required for defence (Fig. 4). To assess whether PT modification is sufficient to protect viruses against PbeABCD interference, we propagated SNJ1 in CJ7-F cells expressing only dndCDEA, yielding PT-modified SNJ1 (Supplementary Fig. 5). In sharp contrast to the strong protection observed against the non-PT-modified SNJ1 virus, CJ7-F cells expressing dndCDEA-pbeABCD displayed the same susceptibility to PT-modified SNJ1 as CJ7-F cells lacking dndCDEA-pbeABCD (Fig. 4).  It is, therefore, likely that dndCDEA-pbeABCD encodes R-M activity for which DNA PT modification serves as a recognition tag, allowing discrimination between self and non-self DNA. If the Pbe moiety is capable of independent action, then deletion of PT modification genes would likely be detrimental to archaeal cells because genomic 5ʹ-GATC-3ʹ sites would no longer be protected by PT from the restriction activity of PbeABCD. Surprisingly, it was easy to prepare the plasmids pWHU3809, pWHU3810, pWHU3811 and pWHU3812 harbouring individually in-frame-deleted dndCDEA genes but a complete pbeABCD (Supplementary Table 3). Indeed, these plasmids exerted no notable toxicity towards CJ7-F cells and failed to reduce the ability of SNJ1 virus to cause plaque formation, despite the expression of pbeABCD (Supplementary Fig. 6).  Thus, it is possible that the antiviral activity of PbeABCD depends on DNA PT modification in trans or on DndCEDA proteins. To address this possibility, we attempted to construct a plasmid (pWHU3789) expressing DndCDEAC344S-PbeABCD with a single cysteine replaced by serine in DndA. The catalytic cysteine of DndA (C344), corresponding to C327 in S. lividans DndA, is responsible for the nucleophilic attack on the substrate cysteine37. Thus, although this mutation would abolish DNA PT modification at 5ʹ-GPSATC-3ʹ, the integrity of the DndCDEA assembly would be retained. The immediate observation was that in spite of the deficiency of PT modification, pbeABCD was still transcribed in CJ7-F(dndCDEAC344S, pbeABCD), excluding the possibility that DndA or PT acts as a transcriptional regulator of the pbe operon (Supplementary Fig. 7a, b). However, while the transformation of CJ7-F hosts with the pWHU3789 plasmid occurred at normal frequency, the CJ7-F(pWHU3879) transformant restored the sensitivity to SNJ1 (Supplementary Fig. 7c). This result suggested that PbeABCD exerted antiviral activity depending on the presence of PT modifications rather than protein–protein interactions with DndCDEA. This activity differentiates the PbeABCD-mediated defence mechanism from that of DndFGH because the latter still exerted a bactericidal effect, even in the absence of PT modification.  PbeABCD allows virus adsorption but inhibits DNA replication  To gain further insight into the mechanism of action of the PbeABCD-mediated PT defence system, we examined whether the system provides protection by hindering virus attachment. To this end, we compared the efficiency of SNJ1 adsorption to dndCDEA-pbeABCD-containing and dndCDEA-pbeABCD-lacking CJ7-F cells. The result showed that SNJ1 viruses were able to adsorb to the archaeal cells at the same rates regardless of the presence of the dndCDEA-pbeABCD system (Fig. 5a). This finding suggests that DndCDEA-PbeABCD does not offer protection by interfering with virus attachment.Fig. 5Adsorption and DNA replication of the SNJ1 virus in CJ7-F cells expressing or lacking DndCDEA-PbeABCD. a Adsorption of SNJ1 to dndCDEA-pbeABCD-containing CJ7-F cells (red) is not impaired compared to that observed for CJ7-F cells containing the empty vector pFJ6-H (black). After the infection of logarithmic-stage cultures (OD600 = 0.3) with SNJ1 at an MOI = 1, samples were collected at 60-min intervals, and the extracellular (unabsorbed) viral concentration was measured and compared to the initial viral concentrations. The bars represent the means of three experiments, and the error bars represent the SD of the mean. b Real-time qPCR analysis to determine the replication efficiency of the virus SNJ1 in CJ7-F cells expressing (red) or lacking (black) dndCDEA-pbeABCD. Primers amplifying repA and radA were used to determine the concentration of SNJ1 DNA and CJ7-F chromosomes, respectively. The 2CT(radA) – CT(repA) method was used to determine the relative levels of SNJ1 DNA in CJ7-F hosts. c Southern blot analysis of the SNJ1 genome during the infection cycle. Numbers indicate the time (min) following infection. A probe was designed corresponding to positions 9243–9732 nt in the SNJ1 genome. Source data are provided as a Source Data file  We next monitored the replication efficiency of SNJ1 viral DNA during the time course of the infection using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). The PCR products for repA, which is located within the replication region of SNJ1, and radA, a single-copy gene located on the CJ7-F chromosome, were used to estimate the relative viral DNA concentrations compared to archaeal genome equivalents38. After 5 h of infection, a 2.5-fold increase in the intracellular SNJ1 genome level was observed in CJ7-F (dndCDEA, pbeABCD), whereas a 16.7-fold increase was detected in CJ7-F containing the empty vector (Fig. 5b). These results revealed that SNJ1 DNA can be successfully injected into Natrinema cells but that the subsequent viral genome replication process is significantly inhibited by the DndCDEA-PbeABCD system. This observation, along with the results of the adsorption assays, indicated that the replication inhibition likely results from viral DNA cleavage or degradation.  To examine the integrity of SNJ1 DNA, we performed a Southern blot analysis using total DNA isolated from CJ7-F cells treated with SNJ1 at various time points after infection. With increasing infection time, extensive SNJ1 DNA accumulation was observed in dndCDEA-pbeABCD-lacking but not dndCDEA-pbeABCD-containing CJ7-F cells, indicating that DndCDEA-PbeABCD halts viral infection at an early stage (Fig. 5c). Notably, SNJ1 DNA remained intact with no sign of cleavage or processive degradation, even 6 h after infection of CJ7-F cells expressing the DndCDEA-PbeABCD system (Fig. 5c). Consistent with the real-time qPCR results, the Southern blot analysis showed a marginal increase in SNJ1 DNA with an extended infection time, even in the presence of DndCDEA-PbeABCD. Considering the self/non-self discrimination strategy, one explanation for this result is that once SNJ1 DNA acquires PT modification prior to the action of PbeABCD, it is regarded as self-DNA and can replicate in CJ7-F cells, highlighting an evolutionary arms race between the PbeABCD-mediated defence barrier and parasitic DNA. Collectively, these results suggested that DndCDEA-PbeABCD confers resistance against invading viruses via a mechanism other than the direct cleavage or degradation of viral DNA used in canonical R-M systems.  PT-based PbeABCD systems are widespread in microbial genomes  After discovering this new PT-based defence activity in Archaea, we re-examined pbeABCD-adjacent genes among the 2361 prokaryotic dndCD regions. As the gene products of pbeB and pbeD are too small to be annotated in some genomes, we used the sequences of PbeA and PbeC from H. jeotgali A29 as queries for homology searches. In addition to 26 archaeal genomes, 235 additional pbeAC genes were identified in diverse bacterial genomes. However, the phylogenetic tree did not result in clear clustering of DndCD into distinct groups according to a proximate DndFGH, PbeAC or neither (Fig. 3). Moreover, even strains within the same species can accommodate different types of Dnd defence systems. For example, Enterobacter cloacae e1347 and E. cloacae DS15987 harbour PT-based PbeABCD and DndFGH defence systems, respectively, whereas E. cloacae B2-DHA possesses only a solitary PT modification system lacking the restriction counterparts, which is consistent with the HGT of Dnd systems (Supplementary Data 3).  Considering the functional association, we next examined whether these PT modification components had coevolved and been horizontally transferred together with PbeABCD, similar to what occurred with DndFGH34. Using DndCD and PbeAC of H. jeotgali A29 as references, we calculated the alignment similarity rate between the 261 DndCD-PbeAC pairs and their respective reference Dnd and Pbe proteins using the approach previously described34. The same calculation was applied to the 1132 coexisting DndCD-DndFGH proteins, with DndFGH of S. enterica serovar Cerro 87 used as the reference. In general, the coevolution of the modification and restriction components should lead to a linear relationship between their similarity rates34. The results showed that the correlation coefficient (ρ) between the similarity rates for DndCD and DndFGH was 0.582, which is consistent with our previous report34 and confirms the coevolution of DndCD and DndFGH (Supplementary Fig. 8a). In contrast, a ρ-value of 0.107 between DndCD and PbeAC was observed, suggesting that either the dndCD and pbeAC genes were acquired separately by HGT events or that they evolved at different mutational rates owing to different genetic selection pressures (Supplementary Fig. 8b).  To gain a more global view of this new type of PT-based PbeABCD defence system, we performed homology searches and constructed a phylogenetic tree using all 553 PbeAC proteins detected (Fig. 6). An immediate observation was the occurrence of potential interdomain and intradomain gene transfer events. For instance, instead of clustering with other halophilic Archaea, Halorubrum trapanicum CBA1232 grouped with a large clade of bacterial strains, including those of the genera Lactobacillus, Staphylococcus and Bacillus. Surprisingly, only 42.1% (233) of 553 PbeAC proteins were observed to be accompanied by dndCD within 1 bp–10 kb, raising two possibilities: (1) that the solitary PbeABCD components are not active in host cells because their antiviral activity depends on the presence of PT modification and (2) that PbeABCD has evolved to pair with other DNA modifications, such as methylation, to yield new defensive modules. The latter possibility is supported by the observation that candidate base-modifying proteins are encoded within 10 kb of 155 of 320 solitary PbeAC examples (Supplementary Data 4). Notably, PbeAC and DndFGH were observed to be simultaneously present in the neighbourhood of 25 bacterial dndCD clusters (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Data 3). It would be interesting to explore the interactions between these gene cassettes and their contributions to the host defence against invasive DNA.Fig. 6Phylogenetic analysis of 553 PbeAC proteins. Each archaeal and bacterial group is represented in a distinct colour. Green (128) and blue (155) shading indicate the presence of DndCD for phosphorothioate (PT) modification or MTase for methylation within the vicinity of PbeAC. One-hundred and five PbeAC homologues have DndCD and MTase simultaneously present within the defined neighbourhood (1 bp–10 kb), while 165 PbeAC homologues are solitary, lacking the modification component within the neighbourhood.

PMC6459918,Abstract,Abstract,CP031304,0,0,0,,,"  Archaea and Bacteria have evolved different defence strategies that target virtually all steps of the viral life cycle. The diversified virion morphotypes and genome contents of archaeal viruses result in a highly complex array of archaea-virus interactions. However, our understanding of archaeal antiviral activities lags far behind our knowledges of those in bacteria. Here we report a new archaeal defence system that involves DndCDEA-specific DNA phosphorothioate (PT) modification and the PbeABCD-mediated halt of virus propagation via inhibition of DNA replication. In contrast to the breakage of invasive DNA by DndFGH in bacteria, DndCDEA-PbeABCD does not degrade or cleave viral DNA. The PbeABCD-mediated PT defence system is widespread and exhibits extensive interdomain and intradomain gene transfer events. Our results suggest that DndCDEA-PbeABCD is a new type of PT-based virus resistance system, expanding the known arsenal of defence systems as well as our understanding of host-virus interactions.  The prokaryote defence system Dnd relies on phosphorothioation (PT) of DNA backbone to distinguish between self and non-self DNA. Here, Xiong et al. describe a previously uncharacterized PT-based antiviral system that is independent of the canonical Dnd and is widespread in Archaea and Bacteria.  ",FALSE,FALSE,

""","  Discussion  In this study, we describe a new type of PT-based multi-gene antiviral system in Archaea, DndCDEA-PbeABCD, that is genetically and phenotypically distinct from DndBCDE-DndFGH. In spite of the absence of the transcriptional repressor DndB, the DndCDEA-PbeABCD system in four haloarchaeal strains drives motif-specific DNA PT modifications at frequencies comparable to those observed in Bacteria32,34. Approximately half of PT sites occur in the form of hemi-PT-modified 5ʹ-GPSATC-3ʹ/5ʹ-GATC-3ʹ in Archaea, which is in sharp contrast to the predominant full PT modifications that occur in Bacteria32,34. However, although PbeABCD allows viral adsorption and DNA injection into the host archaeal cells, it prevents viral DNA replication in a PT-dependent manner. Notably, the DndCDEA-PbeABCD pair was no longer able to protect against a PT-modified SNJ1 virus, suggesting a strategy of utilising epigenetic modification for self/non-self discrimination. We therefore speculated that PbeABCD serves as the REase component to target non-PT-modified viral DNA, analogous to R-M systems. However, two lines of evidence point to a novel mechanism of defence that is different from type II R-M systems, which have autonomous REase and MTase activities, and PT-based DndFGH systems. First, no sign of the processive degradation or cleavage of viral DNA was detected in the presence of DndCDEA-PbeABCD. Second, in typical R-M or DndFGH-mediated Dnd systems, the loss of methylation or PT would be detrimental to cells because the resulting host DNA would be recognised as invading foreign DNA and be attacked by REases or DndFGH. However, dndCDEA deletion mutants exhibited no apparent growth defect compared to CJ7-F cells expressing intact dndCDEA-pbeABCD, although protection against the virus was lost.  We also showed that all four genes in the pbeABCD module appear to be essential for protection against viral infection. PbeA consists of a PLD domain35, a Res subunit of Type III REase domain and a helicase domain39,40, suggesting that it has multiple enzymatic activities. The PLD domain is present in a wide variety of enzymes involved in phospholipid metabolism, virulence, membrane remodelling and signalling35. In addition, it is also recognised as a characteristic of a small family of endonucleases in bacteria, such as Nuc, CglI, NgoAvII, BfiI and DrmC, a component of the newly identified multi-gene R-M module DISARM2,41–43. The Res subunit of Type III REase (i.e., EcoP15I) is a fusion between a DEAD-family helicase, correlating with the DNA translocation activity, and a nuclease resembling the functionally related HsdR subunit of the type I REases39,40. Nonetheless, the PD-X-D/EXK motif, the nuclease active site for DNA cleavage, is not present in PbeA, which is consistent with the non-DNA-cleavage defensive activity of PbeABCD. Based on the shared helicase motifs between PbeA and type I and III REases, we, speculate that PbeA might be associated with DNA translocation, looping or sliding to target DNA recognition sites. This possibility would explain why without pbeA, the remaining pbeBCD still confer a low-level of resistance to SNJ1. While pbeB and pbeD encode proteins of unknown function sized only 66 and 152 aa, respectively, deletions of them still completely abolished protection against virus SNJ1. Considering their small size, we speculate that PbeB and PbeD might become part of an enzyme complex for stabilisation or functional coupling. Notably, PbeC exhibits sequence resemblance to the structural maintenance of chromosome (SMC) protein (24% identity and 42% similarity) in Hydrococcus rivularis. SMC proteins adopt a V-shaped, two-armed architecture with an ATP-binding cassette (ABC)-like domain at the distal end of each arm and are recognised as one of the most fundamental classes of proteins involving in chromosome segregation, recombinational repair and genome-wide gene regulation (Supplementary Data 5)44. Although the function and interaction of PbeABCD proteins remain to be further elucidated, these preliminary clues indicate a possible mechanism of action whereby viral DNA molecules are manipulated in a certain manner to inhibit viral replication and propagation. In terms of the PT dependence, we speculate that Pbe protein(s) might sense PT DNA to function or that PbeABCD rely on PT to form an active assembly.  It was interesting to observe the potential HGT events of DndCD between different bacterial phyla, as well as between Archaea and Bacteria. However, based on the phenomenon that DndFGH occurs only in Bacteria and not in Archaea, this interdomain HGT situation does not hold for the restriction component DndFGH. Instead, the PT modifications in Archaea have evolved to be paired with PbeABCD, generating a new type of PT-based defence module with mechanisms of action that differ from those of DndFGH. In addition, PbeABCD-mediated PT defence pairs are also widespread among Bacteria. Further phylogenetic analysis of PbeAC revealed two unusual observations: (1) 320 of 553 pbeAC are solitary, lacking the counterpart PT modification dnd genes; and (2) pbeAC, dndFGH and PT modification genes coexist in 25 bacterial strains. Regarding the occurrence of solitary pbeAC, it is possible that they are not functional due to their dependence on PT. This scenario is different from that of the REases in type I and III R-M systems, which are activated via protein–protein interactions with the cognate MTases to enable their restriction activity. At present, we still cannot rule out the possibility that PbeABCD has evolved to pair with other modification counterparts, such as MTases, to generate new defensive modules, which is supported by the observation that 155 of 320 solitary pbeAC components are in close proximity to genes encoding MTases. In terms of the coexistence of DndFGH, PbeABCD and PT modifications, it is currently unclear whether the first two are both functional or which one pairs with PT or methylation as a defensive module, emphasising the possibility of complicated interactions worthy of future investigation.  In the host–parasite coevolutionary arms race, viruses have developed a variety of counter-resistance tactics to circumvent the arsenal of prokaryotic resistance mechanisms5. Considering that the PT-modified SNJ1 virus can bypass PbeABCD-mediated PT defence systems, we can speculate that once the virus completes an infection cycle, the resulting SNJ1 progeny possessing PT modifications would overcome this defence in other archaeal and bacterial cells, regardless of the presence of PbeABCD or DndFGH. Thus, in future studies, it would be interesting to identify viruses with naturally occurring PT modifications or to explore other strategies used by viruses to avoid, circumvent or subvert PT-based defence systems.  Owing to the fairly limited number of archaeal host–virus systems studied, our understanding of archaeal host–virus interactions lags far behind our understanding of those in Bacteria. These limitations also hinder the exploration of new defensive mechanisms in Archaea. In this study, we identified a new type of PT-based Dnd defence system that is widespread in Archaea and Bacteria. The antiviral activity of PbeABCD depends on the presence of DNA PT modification but does not involve viral DNA degradation or cleavage, ruling out the involvement of currently known defence mechanisms. These findings expand our knowledge regarding the arsenal of archaeal defence systems and illuminate the archaeal host–virus arms race.  ",FALSE,TRUE,

PMC6459918,Introduction,Introduction,CP031304,1,0,0,1,"""In this study, we first identify PT modifications in halophilic and methanogenic archaea that show diverse sequence specificities and abundance comparable to those observed in bacteria.""","  Introduction  Viruses are the most abundant biological entities in the biosphere and are estimated to outnumber their bacterial and archaeal hosts by tenfold. The constant threat of virus predation has led to the evolution of diverse defence mechanisms that target nearly every stage of the viral infectious cycle. These mechanisms involve inhibiting adsorption, blocking viral DNA injection, restriction-modification (R-M), limiting phage growth, toxin-antitoxin systems, abortive infection and CRISPR/Cas systems, as well as the newly discovered prokaryotic Argonaute, BREX, DISARM, Zorya and Dnd defence systems1–6.  Among these mechanisms, the use of R-M systems is the most prevalent and best-characterised antiviral approach among Bacteria and Archaea. Generally, R-M systems consist of two contrasting enzymatic activities: (1) a methyltransferase (MTase) that catalyses the transfer of a methyl group to DNA nucleobases within a particular sequence motif of ‘self’ DNA and (2) a restriction endonuclease (REase) cognate that identifies and destroys invading foreign DNA that harbours the same DNA motif when not methylated. Four major types of R-M systems (I, II, III and IV) are classified based on their subunit composition, cofactor requirements, sequence recognition and cleavage mechanisms7. Type I R-M systems comprise three subunits, R (restriction), M (modification) and S (specificity), and the resulting complex binds to a bipartite sequence and requires ATP hydrolysis to cleave at a distant site following DNA translocations8. Type II systems are the simplest, which contain separate MTase and REase enzymes to act independently. Type III systems are multifunctional oligomeric proteins consisting of a Mod and a Res subunit. The Mod subunit alone can function independently as a MTase to recognise non-palindromic sequences, only one strand of which can be methylated, whereas the Res subunit needs to pair with the Mod subunit for restriction activity9. Type IV systems have no methylase activity and type IV REases recognise and cleave only modified DNA10–12. Although type I–III R-M systems are tremendously diverse, the associated DNA modifications most commonly occur in the form of methylation of nucleobase moieties, such as N6-methyl-adenine, N4-methyl-cytosine and C5-methyl-cytosine.  The Dnd defence system has recently been recognised as a new component of the bacterial innate immune system, in which phosphorothioate (PT) modification is used as a marker to distinguish between self and non-self DNA, analogous to methylation-based R-M systems13,14. In contrast to DNA methylation at nucleobases, PT modification occurs on the DNA sugar-phosphate backbone, where replacement of the non-bridging oxygen by sulphur confers nuclease resistance at the PT linkage13,15. The Dnd system is organised into three parts: (1) DndACDE proteins form a complex and act as the modification component to catalyse DNA PT modification in a sequence-selective manner16,17; (2) DndB is a transcriptional repressor capable of regulating expression of the dndBCDE cluster and the resulting PT level18 and (3) DndFGH proteins function as the R component to recognise and destroy non-PT-modified foreign DNA14,19. All three dndFGH genes are essential to distinguish and restrict the transformation of non-PT-modified incoming plasmid DNA in Salmonella enterica4. Once PT modification is abolished, S. enterica suffers double-stranded DNA damage from the unrestrained restriction activity of DndFGH, which consequently leads to growth defects and triggers the SOS response14,20. Although the enzymatic activities and mechanism of action of DndFGH is currently unclear, these features resemble the well-characterised ‘self/non-self discrimination’ strategy of methylation-based R-M systems.  To prevent REase attack on resident DNA, the recognition motifs are generally nearly completely methylated by the MTase counterpart. However, this situation is not observed for Dnd defence systems. Indeed, only 4855 of 40,701 complementary 5ʹ-GAAC-3ʹ/5ʹ-GTTC-3ʹ consensus sequences found in the Escherichia coli B7A genome are PT modified to 5ʹ-GPSAAC-3ʹ/5ʹ-GPSTTC-3ʹ (PS: phosphate-sulphur linkage), even in the presence of active DndFGH, ruling out the known R-M mechanisms.  Although the number of described archaeal viruses accounts for only 1% of all reported prokaryotic viruses, the archaeal viruses exhibit enormously diversified morphotypes and genome contents21–24. Many of the unique morphologies of archaeal viruses, including coil-shaped, bottle-shaped, spherical and droplet-shaped with beard-like fibres, have not been observed among bacterial or eukaryotic viruses21. Consistent with the uniqueness of viral morphotypes, the genome contents of these archaeal viruses are distinctive, with ~75% of genes encoding functionally unknown proteins25. Although the current knowledge of archaeal viruses has merely touched the tip of the iceberg, one may imagine the development of diverse defence systems during the coevolutionary arms race between archaea and viruses given the distinct morphological and genomic properties of viruses.  Indeed, as in Bacteria, an astonishing array of defence systems have developed among Archaea to restrict invasive viruses and plasmids. For example, 96% of the sequenced bacterial genomes harbour R-M systems, while 384 (98%) of the 390 currently available archaeal genomes encode R-M systems (http://rebase.neb.com/rebase/rebase.html)26, as of the time of writing of this manuscript. However, only a few archaeal R-M systems have been investigated to date, including R.PabI from the hyperthermophilic Pyrococcus abyssi, R.PspGI from Pyrococcus sp. strain GI-H, R.SuaI from the thermoacidophilic Sulfolobus acidocaldarius and their cognate MTases27–30. Moreover, archaea wrap their DNA into histone-DNA complexes with the same geometry as DNA in the eukaryotic nucleosomes31, prompting us to investigate the aspects of PT modification and PT-related functions in Archaea.  In this study, we first identify PT modifications in halophilic and methanogenic archaea that show diverse sequence specificities and abundance comparable to those observed in bacteria. However, no trace of the restriction component DndFGH is detected in any of the archaeal strains assessed. Instead, we report that PT-modification genes, such as dndCDEA in the halophilic archaeon Haloterrigena jeotgali A29, can defend against viral attack together with pbeABCD, a conserved 4-gene cassette sharing no sequence homology with DndFGH. Moreover, the defence mechanism involves the DndCDEA-mediated PT modification of the self-DNA sequence and the use of PbeABCD to halt virus propagation by inhibiting DNA replication in a PT-dependent manner. Unlike the DndFGH-mediated defence mechanism, DndCDEA-PbeABCD does not function through the degradation or cleavage of viral DNA, highlighting a novel mode of action that is distinct from R-M activity and expanding the arsenal of known defence systems, as well as our understanding of host–virus interactions.

The coevolution analysis has been described in detail previously34.""","  Methods  Strains and growth conditions  All the strains, plasmids and primers used in this study are listed in Supplementary Tables 3 and 4. Natrinema sp. CJ7-F and its derivative strains were cultured in Halo-2 or minimal medium (MM, 18%) at 45 °C, as previously described45. H. jeotgali A29, H. limi JCM 16811 and H. salinum JCM 19729 were cultivated in JCM medium 402, and N. bangense JCM 10635 was grown in JCM medium 167. To construct plasmids, E. coli strains were routinely grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium at 37 °C. To prepare solid agar medium, agar was added to the medium to a final concentration of 15 g/L. When necessary, ampicillin was added to the medium at a concentration of 100 μg/mL.  Construction and expression of pWHU3808 and derivatives  The shuttle vector pFJ6-H was used to express dndCDEA-pbeABCD from H. jeotgali A29 and its derivatives in CJ7-F45. Plasmid pWHU3808, expressing the complete dndCDEA-pbeABCD module, was constructed in two steps. First, the dndCDEA and pbeABCD fragments were PCR amplified from H. jeotgali A29 genomic DNA using the primer pairs dndCDEA-pYC-F/dndCDEA-pYC-R and pbeABCD-F/pbeABCD-R, respectively. The fragments were inserted into the SnaBI-HindIII-digested pYCJ-HH and NotI-SphI-digested pFJ6-H, yielding pWHU3253 and pWHU3804, respectively. Second, the heat-shock protein 70 (HSP 70) promoter and the dndCDEA fusion fragments were PCR amplified from pWHU3253 using the primer pair Hpro-dndCDEA-F/Hpro-dndCEDA-R. The PCR product was then ligated into pWHU3804 digested with NdeI and KpnI, yielding pWHU3808. For the in-frame deletion of pbeA in pWHU3808, a 5.2 kb fragment containing the downstream portion of pbeA was first generated by PCR using the primer pair ΔpbeA-F/ΔpbeA-R from pWHU3808 (Supplementary Table 4). The PCR products and the NdeI-NotI digested pWHU3808, sharing 25–30 bp identical sequences, were mixed to allow site-specific recombination using a Hieff Clone™ Plus One Step Cloning Kit (Yeasen), generating plasmid pWHU3813. To generate the in-frame deletion of pbeB in pWHU3808, the upstream and downstream fragments of pbeB were PCR amplified using the primer pairs ΔpbeB-UF/ΔpbeB-UR and ΔpbeB-DF/ΔpbeB-DR, respectively (Supplementary Table 4). The two purified PCR products and the NdeI-NotI-digested pWHU3808 were mixed according to the manufacturer’s instructions for recombination to generate the plasmid pWHU3814. The procedures used to construct the other pWHU3808-derived plasmids expressing in-frame deletions of the dnd genes were similar to those used for pWHU3814. All of the recombinant plasmids were verified by sequencing. The transformation of CJ7-F was performed at room temperature using the polyethylene glycol (PEG) method, as previously described38. MM (18%) medium was used to select and propagate CJ7-F transformants.  Absorption assay  CJ7-F cells expressing or lacking dndCDEA-pbeABCD were grown in Halo-2 medium to an OD600 of 0.3, followed by infection with virus SNJ1 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1. During infection, the archaeal cells and virus were incubated with shaking at 45 °C. Aliquots of 1 mL of culture were withdrawn at time points 1, 60, 120, 180, 240 and 300 min post infection, and the cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 1 min. The unabsorbed SNJ1 concentration in the upper aqueous phase was determined on CJ7-F cell lawns. The percentage of unabsorbed (extracellular) virus SNJ1 was calculated assuming the initial titre of SNJ1 (without added cells) to be 100%.  Determination of relative SNJ1 levels in CJ7-F hosts  CJ7-F cells harbouring pWHU3808 or the empty vector pFJ6-H, expressing or lacking dndCDEA-pbeABCD, respectively, were cultured in 20 mL of Halo-2 medium until the cell density reached an OD600 of 0.3. Logarithmic-phase cultures were infected with the SNJ1 virus at an MOI of 1. Multiple 1-mL samples of the cultures were collected at the indicated time point by centrifugation, and the cells were resuspended in 100 μL of basal salt solution (medium without a carbon source). Total DNA from CJ7-F strains containing the different vectors was prepared as described previously46. Briefly, cells resuspended in 100 μL of basal salt solution were lysed after the addition of 900 μL of distilled water. The lysate was diluted 1:100 with distilled water and then was used as the template for real-time qPCR. The levels of the single-copy gene radA38, located on the chromosome of the host strain, and repA, located in the genome of SNJ1, were determined by real-time qPCR to estimate the relative intracellular levels of SNJ1 DNA relative to the CJ7-F chromosome during infection.  RNA extraction and reverse transcription  Total RNA was extracted from the H. jeotgali A29 strain using an Omega RNA Extraction Kit (Omega Bio-Tec) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Next, the RNA samples were treated with DNase I (Thermo Fisher) to remove residual genomic DNA, and the RNA was then quantified using a NanoDrop2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher). The RNA was reverse transcribed using a RevertAid First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Fermentas) to obtain cDNA.  SNJ1 propagation and isolation  The haloarchaeal virus SNJ1 was propagated in Natrinema sp. J7-145. The J7-1 strain was grown at 45 °C in Halo-2 medium to late log phase (OD600 = 0.8–1.0), after which mitomycin C (Roche) was added to the cultures at a final concentration of 1 μg/mL, followed by overnight incubation at 37 °C with shaking at 200 rpm. The cultures were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 20 min to remove cellular debris, and the supernatants were subsequently filtered through 0.22-µm Millipore pore membrane filters. When necessary, a PEG6000 solution was used to concentrate the phage preparations, as described previously47.  Plaque assays  Halovirus plaque assays were performed as described previously48, with slight modifications. Briefly, the CJ7-F derivative strains were grown at 45 °C in 18% MM medium to late log phase (OD600 = ~0.8–1.0). Next, an aliquot (400 µL) of the culture was mixed with molten soft agar (0.6%) and poured onto Halo-2 agar plates (1.5%). Once solidified, 5 μL of serial tenfold dilutions of SNJ1 were pipetted onto the agar. The plates were incubated for 36 h at 45 °C, and the phage titres were calculated as PFU (plaque-forming unit)/mL.  Southern blot analysis  CJ7-F cells possessing pWHU3808 and pFJ6-H were incubated with the SNJ1 virus at an MOI of 5. Multiple aliquots of 10 mL of culture were collected at different time points (1, 5, 10, 15, 30 min and 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 h) post infection. In addition, samples of the cultures prior to the addition of SNJ1 were used as negative controls. Total genomic DNA was extracted and digested with SacI for Southern blot analysis. The primers SNJ1-southern-F and SNJ1-southern-R were designed to synthesise a probe corresponding to the region from 9243 to 9732 nt of the SNJ1 genome (Supplementary Table 4). The DNA probe preparation, hybridisation and detection were performed using a Detection Starter Kit II (Roche) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.  Bioinformatic and statistical analysis  Using the DndC, DndD, PbeA and PbeC protein sequences from H. jeotgali A29 and the DndF, DndG, and DndH sequences from S. enterica serovar Cerro 87 and Hahella chejuensis KCTC 2396 as BLAST queries, we searched the NCBI databases of non-redundant nucleotide collections, RefSeq_genomes, WGS, HTGS, refseq_genomic, and GSS. The BLAST hits were filtered using an e-value of ≤10−10 and an aligned length of ≥30% to the query sequences. The distance between dndC and dndD was limited to 5 kb or less. Flanking regions of ±20 kb around the dndCD cluster were searched for the presence of pbeA, pbeC, dndF, dndG and dndH. Similarly, we searched for genes encoding MTases or DndCD within close proximity (1 bp–10 kb) to pbeAC.  The sequences used to generate the phylogenetic trees were formed by concatenating the protein sequences of DndC and DndD, and PbeA and PbeC. Multiple alignments were performed using MEGA 5.2 with the MUSCLE algorithm. The parameters were set as follows: gap open = −2.9, gap extend = 0, hydrophobicity multiplier = 1.2, max iterations = 8, and min dialogue length = 24, and the UPGMB method was used for clustering. Trees were constructed using the maximum likelihood method with 500 bootstrap replications. The other parameters were set as follows: substitution type = amino acid, substitution model = Jones-Taylor-Thornton model, rates among sites = uniform rates, gaps/missing data treatment = complete deletion, maximum likelihood heuristic method = Nearest-Neighbour-Interchange, and the neighbour-joining method was used to constructed the initial tree. The output trees were visualised by iTOL49.  DndCD and PbeAC sequences wereglobally aligned with those of H. jeotgali A29 using the needle programme in the EMBOSS package50. Similarity values were extracted from the output files. The coevolution analysis has been described in detail previously34. Generally, we regressed the similarity values of PbeAC to those of DndCD to explore their coevolution on the basis of the idea that the divergence degree (i.e., 1 minus the similarity rate) of PbeAC and DndCD from their respective ancestor should be linearly related in a given strain, if they evolve at the same speed. The same regression analysis was also performed on DndCD and DndFGH. As H. jeotgali A29 lacks dndFGH, global alignments were made with the sequence data from S. enterica serovar Cerro 87.  All statistical and bioinformatic analyses were performed in R.  ",FALSE,TRUE,

In this study, we first identified DNA PT modifications in five archaea with homologous PT-modification genes. Based on mass spectral analysis, nuclease-resistant PT-linked dinucleotides were produced upon enzymatic hydrolysis of archaeal DNA (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. 1). The following strains were observed to harbour PT-modified d(GPSA): three halophilic archaeal strains, H. jeotgali A29, isolated from salt-fermented shrimp jeotgal, and Halapricum salinum JCM 19729 and Halobellus limi JCM 16811, isolated from solar salterns in Korea and China, respectively; and one haloalkaliphilic archaeal strain, Natronorubrum bangense JCM 10635, isolated from a soda lake in Tibet. H. limi JCM 16811 also possesses a detectable level of d(GPSG). An acidophilic methanogen, Methanoregula boonei 6A8, isolated from an acid peat bog in the United States, also shows PT modification at d(GPSA) and d(GPSG) of the same order of magnitude (Table 1). These findings reveal the diversity of PT consensus sequences among Archaea. Next, we determined that the dndCDEA operon of H. jeotgali A29 was capable of conferring d(GPSA) modification upon transfer to a new host, Natrinema sp. CJ7-F, an extreme haloarchaeon without endogenous dnd genes (Supplementary Fig. 1).Fig. 1Maximum likelihood phylogeny of 2642 homologues of the H. jeotgali A29 DndCD identified in Archaea and Bacteria. The strain names of 42 archaea, as well as the phosphorothioate (PT) sequence contexts identified in this study are displayed as noted. Each prokaryotic phylum is represented in a distinct colour (see the legend). Bacterial strain names are also provided in Supplementary Data 1. For clarity, at least one familiar genus per colour segment were labelled. The structure of PT-modified d(GPSA) in the RP configuration is shown in the centre of the tree.

Source data are provided as a Source Data fileNA, not applicableaIndicates that the PT-linked dinucleotides were detected but were below the limit of quantification  We next used the DndCD protein sequences (DndE is too small to be annotated in some genomes) of H. jeotgali A29 as a query to explore the occurrence and diversity of Dnd systems across archaeal genomes. Using BLAST, we searched the homologues of DndCD in the NCBI databases of non-redundant nucleotide collections (nt), RefSeq Genome (refseq_genomes), whole-genome shotgun contigs (WGS), high-throughput genomic sequences (HTGS), reference genomic sequences (refseq_genomic), and genomic survey sequences (GSS). We filtered the results based on an e-value of ≤ 10−10 and discarded BLAST hits with aligned lengths of ≤ 30% of the query proteins. A total of 2642 occurrences of dndCD were identified nested within 2600 bacterial and 42 archaeal genomes (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Data 1). The 42 Archaea harbouring DndCD homologues span the phylogenetic diversity of archaeal lineages, including Methanomicrobia (23), Haloarchaea (7), Thaumarchaeota (6), Bathyarchaeota (2), Thermoplasmata (2), and Heimdallarchaeota (1), as well as an uncultured marine group II/III euryarchaeote KM3_173_A11 (Supplementary Data 1). According to the phylogenetic tree of the 2642 DndCD proteins (archaeal and bacterial DndCD proteins), the archaeal strains do not phylogenetically cluster together but instead are grouped with bacteria, suggesting potential interdomain HGT of Dnd systems between Archaea and Bacteria (Fig. 1).  Genome-wide PT features in Archaea  In contrast to the well-characterised dndBCDE cluster in bacterial genomes, dndCDEA clusters in H. jeotgali A29, N. bangense JCM 10635, H. limi JCM 16811 and H. salinum JCM 19729 are not accompanied by dndB, which encodes a negative regulator that binds to the promoter region of the dndBCDE operon. Upon relief of DndB repression, the transcription of dndBCDE and the resulting PT frequency increased by 15- and 2-fold, respectively, in the bacterial strain S. enterica serovar Cerro 8718. However, in the four haloarchaeal strains, we observed d(GPSA) at an average frequency of ~2–3 PT per 104 nt, which is comparable to the frequency of ~3–8 PT per 104 nt detected in bacteria16, prompting us to examine the PT features across the archaeal genomes (Table 1).  To this end, we exploited the single-molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing platform to profile the genome-wide PT sites32,33. The SMRT sequencing data immediately revealed the occurrence of d(GPSA) in a 4-bp consensus sequence of 5ʹ-GPSATC-3ʹ in all four haloarchaea genomes (Supplementary Fig. 2). Only 2.6% (2451) out of 94,316, 2.1% (1614) out of 75,884, 2.4% (1442) out of 60,776, and 1.4% (895) out of 64,824 5ʹ-GATC-3ʹ sites in H. jeotgali A29, N. bangense JCM 10635, H. limi JCM 16811 and H. salinum JCM 19729 were detected to be PT modified, respectively (Supplementary Data 2). Although no further sequence constraint beyond the 4-bp 5ʹ-GPSATC-3ʹ was identified, we observed sequence biases for PT modification-proximate bases, with a noticeable preference for 5ʹ-tGPSATCc-3ʹ but an underrepresentation at 5ʹ-gGPSATC(g/t)-3ʹ (Supplementary Table 1). No PT enrichment in particular DNA regions was observed across all four archaeal genomes (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Data 2). For instance, 1229 and 1222 5ʹ-GPSATC-3ʹ sites were observed to be located on the (+) and (−) strands of the H. jeotgali A29 genome, respectively, with various spacing ranging from 4 to 36 kb. In addition, 915 out of 4745 open reading frames, 8 out of 13 rRNA genes and 31 out of 200 pseudogenes in H. jeotgali A29 harbour at least one PT site (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Data 2). While 1310 of 2451, 674 of 1614, 736 of 1442, and 244 of 895 genomic PTs were detected to be fully PT-modified (on both strands) 5ʹ-GPSATC-3ʹ/5ʹ-GPSATC-3ʹ in H. jeotgali A29, N. bangense JCM 10635, H. limi JCM 16811 and H. salinum JCM 19729, respectively, up to 47% (1141), 58% (940), 49% (706), and 73% (651) of PT sites occur in the form of hemimodified 5ʹ-GPSATC-3ʹ/5ʹ-GATC-3ʹ (Supplementary Fig. 2). These results are in sharp contrast to the predominant full PT modification found in 5ʹ-GPSAAC-3ʹ/5ʹ-GPSTTC-3 in E. coli B7A32 and 5ʹ-GPSGCC-3ʹ/5ʹ-GPSGCC-3ʹ in Pseudomonas fluorescens pf0–134, suggesting different PT physiologies among Archaea. Additionally, it was interesting to observe the presence of DNA methylation in a variety of sequence contexts, including 5ʹ-TCCGA6mA-3ʹ, 5ʹ-GAGG6mAG-3ʹ, 5ʹ-C6mATTC-3ʹ, 5ʹ-CAG6mATG-3ʹ, and 5ʹ-CG6mATCC-3ʹ, by SMRT sequencing (Supplementary Table 2), which indicated their potential involvement in methylation-based R-M defence systems, epigenetic regulation, or other biological functions in Archaea.Fig. 2Phosphorothioate (PT) mapping across the genomes of H. jeotgali A29, N. bangense JCM 10635, H. salinum JCM 19729 and H. limi JCM 16811.

Source data are provided as a Source Data file  DndCDEA constitutes a novel antiviral system with PbeABCD  Based on these PT characteristics in Archaea, we sought to explore the genomic neighbourhoods of dndCD by selecting 2361 out of 2642 archaeal and bacterial dndCD with available flanking sequence data. The restriction component dndFGH was observed to be in close proximity (1 bp-20 kb) with 48.8% (1132) of the 2322 bacterial dndCD regions, agreeing well with our previous observations34. Conversely, no trace of dndFGH was observed within the vicinity of all 39 archaeal dndCD. Instead, the majority of these archaeal dndCD clusters are followed by a four-gene cassette arranged in a highly conserved order (Fig. 3).Fig. 3The diversity of phosphorothioate (PT) systems in prokaryotes. a The genetic organisation and gene orders of the PT-based PbeABCD and DndFGH systems are displayed. GenBank accession numbers for pbeABCD in H. jeotgali A29 are indicated. b The phylogenetic tree of 2361 archaeal and bacterial DndCD homologues is colour-coded by phylogenetic group (see the legend). Strains shaded violet, pink, black and green have DndCD homologues associated with PbeABCD, DndFGH, DndFGH-PbeABCD, or none, respectively. The widths of tree branches are proportional to their Bootstrap scores. For clarity, at least one familiar genus per colour segment were labelled. Source data are provided as a Source Data file  Using the gene cassette consisting of DVR14_03960, DVR14_03955, DVR14_03950 and DVR14_03945 in H. jeotgali A29 as an example, the four genes are co-expressed as a single transcriptional unit, consistent with the idea that they are functional related (Supplementary Fig. 3). DVR14_03960 comprises three domains: a phospholipase D (PLD)-like domain (pfam13091), a res subunit of Type III REase (pfam04851) and a DEAD (Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp)-family helicase C-terminal (pfam00271) domain (Supplementary Fig. 4). The PLD domain has been identified as a component of a large superfamily of proteins associated with the hydrolysis of phosphodiester bonds, such as phospholipases, kinases, toxins and REases35. The genes DVR14_03955 and DVR14_03945 encode proteins of unknown function with only 66 and 152 aa in size, respectively. DVR14_03950 contains an N-terminal AAA domain (ATPases associated with diverse cellular activities; pfam13476), a domain that is present in a wide variety of proteins that often direct molecular remodelling events in an ATP-driven process36. Given the positioning of these genes relative to dndCDEA and the predicted nuclease-related functions of their encoded proteins, we speculated that this four-gene cluster may constitute a new defence system involving DNA PT modification in Archaea, and we named the four genes pbeABCD (for phosphorothioate-blocked DNA exclusion).  To explore the involvement of pbeABCD in archaeal host–virus interactions, we cloned the dndCDEA-pbeABCD fragment from H. jeotgali A29 into the shuttle vector pFJ6-H, generating pWHU3808, followed by transformation into Natrinema sp. CJ7-F, a pyrF-deletion and plasmid-free derivative of Natrinema sp. J7-1 (Supplementary Table 3). We next challenged CJ7-F cells expressing dndCDEA-pbeABCD with the halophilic temperate sphaerolipovirus SNJ1. Using a double agar overlay plaque assay, we showed that dndCDEA-pbeABCD provided protection against SNJ1: the ability of SNJ1 to induce plaques was reduced ~104-fold (Fig. 4).Fig. 4DndCDEA-PbeABCD confers protection against the haloarchaeal virus SNJ1. a The dndCDEA-pbeABCD locus of H. jeotgali A29 is displayed. b Five microlitres each of a tenfold serial dilution (106–101) of SNJ1 virus was spotted onto CJ7-F cells carrying pWHU3808-derived plasmids and expressing the genes indicated on the left. The EOPs are listed on the right. The EOPs were determined by dividing the SNJ1 titre obtained by plating on CJ7-F expressing dndCDEA-pbeABCD and derivatives by the titre of SNJ1 plated on CJ7-F(pFJ6-H). The values represent the mean ± SD for three independent experiments. ****p-value < 0.0001, using one-sample t-test (Hypothesis Testing). Ns, not significant. Compared to the strong protection against non-PT SNJ1, CJ7-F cells are susceptible to PT-modified SNJ1, even in the presence of DndCDEA-PbeABCD. Source data are provided as a Source Data file  To further examine the components that are essential for this antiviral activity, we constructed a series of pWHU3808-derived plasmids (pWHU3813~pWHU3816), each expressing DNA PT modification, as well as the individual in-frame deleted genes of the pbeABCD cassette (Supplementary Table 3). Deletion of the individual pbeABCD genes impaired protection against SNJ1, indicating that all four pbe genes are indispensable for mediating antiviral activity (Fig. 4). It is noteworthy that the contributions of four pbe genes against SNJ1 are not equal. To quantify the protection, we measured the efficiency of plating (EOP) of SNJ1 applied to CJ7-F cells expressing different parts of the pbeABCD cassette. In contrast to the absolute necessity of pbeB, pbeC and pbeD, CJ7-F cells expressing dndCDEA-ΔpbeA-pbeBCD still exhibited a low-level of resistance, although less than one order of magnitude, against SNJ1, suggesting that pbeA is partially required for defence (Fig. 4). To assess whether PT modification is sufficient to protect viruses against PbeABCD interference, we propagated SNJ1 in CJ7-F cells expressing only dndCDEA, yielding PT-modified SNJ1 (Supplementary Fig. 5). In sharp contrast to the strong protection observed against the non-PT-modified SNJ1 virus, CJ7-F cells expressing dndCDEA-pbeABCD displayed the same susceptibility to PT-modified SNJ1 as CJ7-F cells lacking dndCDEA-pbeABCD (Fig. 4).  It is, therefore, likely that dndCDEA-pbeABCD encodes R-M activity for which DNA PT modification serves as a recognition tag, allowing discrimination between self and non-self DNA. If the Pbe moiety is capable of independent action, then deletion of PT modification genes would likely be detrimental to archaeal cells because genomic 5ʹ-GATC-3ʹ sites would no longer be protected by PT from the restriction activity of PbeABCD. Surprisingly, it was easy to prepare the plasmids pWHU3809, pWHU3810, pWHU3811 and pWHU3812 harbouring individually in-frame-deleted dndCDEA genes but a complete pbeABCD (Supplementary Table 3). Indeed, these plasmids exerted no notable toxicity towards CJ7-F cells and failed to reduce the ability of SNJ1 virus to cause plaque formation, despite the expression of pbeABCD (Supplementary Fig. 6).  Thus, it is possible that the antiviral activity of PbeABCD depends on DNA PT modification in trans or on DndCEDA proteins. To address this possibility, we attempted to construct a plasmid (pWHU3789) expressing DndCDEAC344S-PbeABCD with a single cysteine replaced by serine in DndA. The catalytic cysteine of DndA (C344), corresponding to C327 in S. lividans DndA, is responsible for the nucleophilic attack on the substrate cysteine37. Thus, although this mutation would abolish DNA PT modification at 5ʹ-GPSATC-3ʹ, the integrity of the DndCDEA assembly would be retained. The immediate observation was that in spite of the deficiency of PT modification, pbeABCD was still transcribed in CJ7-F(dndCDEAC344S, pbeABCD), excluding the possibility that DndA or PT acts as a transcriptional regulator of the pbe operon (Supplementary Fig. 7a, b). However, while the transformation of CJ7-F hosts with the pWHU3789 plasmid occurred at normal frequency, the CJ7-F(pWHU3879) transformant restored the sensitivity to SNJ1 (Supplementary Fig. 7c). This result suggested that PbeABCD exerted antiviral activity depending on the presence of PT modifications rather than protein–protein interactions with DndCDEA. This activity differentiates the PbeABCD-mediated defence mechanism from that of DndFGH because the latter still exerted a bactericidal effect, even in the absence of PT modification.  PbeABCD allows virus adsorption but inhibits DNA replication  To gain further insight into the mechanism of action of the PbeABCD-mediated PT defence system, we examined whether the system provides protection by hindering virus attachment. To this end, we compared the efficiency of SNJ1 adsorption to dndCDEA-pbeABCD-containing and dndCDEA-pbeABCD-lacking CJ7-F cells. The result showed that SNJ1 viruses were able to adsorb to the archaeal cells at the same rates regardless of the presence of the dndCDEA-pbeABCD system (Fig. 5a). This finding suggests that DndCDEA-PbeABCD does not offer protection by interfering with virus attachment.Fig. 5Adsorption and DNA replication of the SNJ1 virus in CJ7-F cells expressing or lacking DndCDEA-PbeABCD. a Adsorption of SNJ1 to dndCDEA-pbeABCD-containing CJ7-F cells (red) is not impaired compared to that observed for CJ7-F cells containing the empty vector pFJ6-H (black). After the infection of logarithmic-stage cultures (OD600 = 0.3) with SNJ1 at an MOI = 1, samples were collected at 60-min intervals, and the extracellular (unabsorbed) viral concentration was measured and compared to the initial viral concentrations. The bars represent the means of three experiments, and the error bars represent the SD of the mean. b Real-time qPCR analysis to determine the replication efficiency of the virus SNJ1 in CJ7-F cells expressing (red) or lacking (black) dndCDEA-pbeABCD. Primers amplifying repA and radA were used to determine the concentration of SNJ1 DNA and CJ7-F chromosomes, respectively. The 2CT(radA) – CT(repA) method was used to determine the relative levels of SNJ1 DNA in CJ7-F hosts. c Southern blot analysis of the SNJ1 genome during the infection cycle. Numbers indicate the time (min) following infection. A probe was designed corresponding to positions 9243–9732 nt in the SNJ1 genome. Source data are provided as a Source Data file  We next monitored the replication efficiency of SNJ1 viral DNA during the time course of the infection using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). The PCR products for repA, which is located within the replication region of SNJ1, and radA, a single-copy gene located on the CJ7-F chromosome, were used to estimate the relative viral DNA concentrations compared to archaeal genome equivalents38. After 5 h of infection, a 2.5-fold increase in the intracellular SNJ1 genome level was observed in CJ7-F (dndCDEA, pbeABCD), whereas a 16.7-fold increase was detected in CJ7-F containing the empty vector (Fig. 5b). These results revealed that SNJ1 DNA can be successfully injected into Natrinema cells but that the subsequent viral genome replication process is significantly inhibited by the DndCDEA-PbeABCD system. This observation, along with the results of the adsorption assays, indicated that the replication inhibition likely results from viral DNA cleavage or degradation.  To examine the integrity of SNJ1 DNA, we performed a Southern blot analysis using total DNA isolated from CJ7-F cells treated with SNJ1 at various time points after infection. With increasing infection time, extensive SNJ1 DNA accumulation was observed in dndCDEA-pbeABCD-lacking but not dndCDEA-pbeABCD-containing CJ7-F cells, indicating that DndCDEA-PbeABCD halts viral infection at an early stage (Fig. 5c). Notably, SNJ1 DNA remained intact with no sign of cleavage or processive degradation, even 6 h after infection of CJ7-F cells expressing the DndCDEA-PbeABCD system (Fig. 5c). Consistent with the real-time qPCR results, the Southern blot analysis showed a marginal increase in SNJ1 DNA with an extended infection time, even in the presence of DndCDEA-PbeABCD. Considering the self/non-self discrimination strategy, one explanation for this result is that once SNJ1 DNA acquires PT modification prior to the action of PbeABCD, it is regarded as self-DNA and can replicate in CJ7-F cells, highlighting an evolutionary arms race between the PbeABCD-mediated defence barrier and parasitic DNA. Collectively, these results suggested that DndCDEA-PbeABCD confers resistance against invading viruses via a mechanism other than the direct cleavage or degradation of viral DNA used in canonical R-M systems.  PT-based PbeABCD systems are widespread in microbial genomes  After discovering this new PT-based defence activity in Archaea, we re-examined pbeABCD-adjacent genes among the 2361 prokaryotic dndCD regions. As the gene products of pbeB and pbeD are too small to be annotated in some genomes, we used the sequences of PbeA and PbeC from H. jeotgali A29 as queries for homology searches. In addition to 26 archaeal genomes, 235 additional pbeAC genes were identified in diverse bacterial genomes. However, the phylogenetic tree did not result in clear clustering of DndCD into distinct groups according to a proximate DndFGH, PbeAC or neither (Fig. 3). Moreover, even strains within the same species can accommodate different types of Dnd defence systems. For example, Enterobacter cloacae e1347 and E. cloacae DS15987 harbour PT-based PbeABCD and DndFGH defence systems, respectively, whereas E. cloacae B2-DHA possesses only a solitary PT modification system lacking the restriction counterparts, which is consistent with the HGT of Dnd systems (Supplementary Data 3).  Considering the functional association, we next examined whether these PT modification components had coevolved and been horizontally transferred together with PbeABCD, similar to what occurred with DndFGH34. Using DndCD and PbeAC of H. jeotgali A29 as references, we calculated the alignment similarity rate between the 261 DndCD-PbeAC pairs and their respective reference Dnd and Pbe proteins using the approach previously described34. The same calculation was applied to the 1132 coexisting DndCD-DndFGH proteins, with DndFGH of S. enterica serovar Cerro 87 used as the reference. In general, the coevolution of the modification and restriction components should lead to a linear relationship between their similarity rates34. The results showed that the correlation coefficient (ρ) between the similarity rates for DndCD and DndFGH was 0.582, which is consistent with our previous report34 and confirms the coevolution of DndCD and DndFGH (Supplementary Fig. 8a). In contrast, a ρ-value of 0.107 between DndCD and PbeAC was observed, suggesting that either the dndCD and pbeAC genes were acquired separately by HGT events or that they evolved at different mutational rates owing to different genetic selection pressures (Supplementary Fig. 8b).  To gain a more global view of this new type of PT-based PbeABCD defence system, we performed homology searches and constructed a phylogenetic tree using all 553 PbeAC proteins detected (Fig. 6). An immediate observation was the occurrence of potential interdomain and intradomain gene transfer events. For instance, instead of clustering with other halophilic Archaea, Halorubrum trapanicum CBA1232 grouped with a large clade of bacterial strains, including those of the genera Lactobacillus, Staphylococcus and Bacillus. Surprisingly, only 42.1% (233) of 553 PbeAC proteins were observed to be accompanied by dndCD within 1 bp–10 kb, raising two possibilities: (1) that the solitary PbeABCD components are not active in host cells because their antiviral activity depends on the presence of PT modification and (2) that PbeABCD has evolved to pair with other DNA modifications, such as methylation, to yield new defensive modules. The latter possibility is supported by the observation that candidate base-modifying proteins are encoded within 10 kb of 155 of 320 solitary PbeAC examples (Supplementary Data 4). Notably, PbeAC and DndFGH were observed to be simultaneously present in the neighbourhood of 25 bacterial dndCD clusters (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Data 3). It would be interesting to explore the interactions between these gene cassettes and their contributions to the host defence against invasive DNA.Fig. 6Phylogenetic analysis of 553 PbeAC proteins. Each archaeal and bacterial group is represented in a distinct colour. Green (128) and blue (155) shading indicate the presence of DndCD for phosphorothioate (PT) modification or MTase for methylation within the vicinity of PbeAC. One-hundred and five PbeAC homologues have DndCD and MTase simultaneously present within the defined neighbourhood (1 bp–10 kb), while 165 PbeAC homologues are solitary, lacking the modification component within the neighbourhood.

PMC6459918,Abstract,Abstract,CP031311,0,0,0,,,"  Archaea and Bacteria have evolved different defence strategies that target virtually all steps of the viral life cycle. The diversified virion morphotypes and genome contents of archaeal viruses result in a highly complex array of archaea-virus interactions. However, our understanding of archaeal antiviral activities lags far behind our knowledges of those in bacteria. Here we report a new archaeal defence system that involves DndCDEA-specific DNA phosphorothioate (PT) modification and the PbeABCD-mediated halt of virus propagation via inhibition of DNA replication. In contrast to the breakage of invasive DNA by DndFGH in bacteria, DndCDEA-PbeABCD does not degrade or cleave viral DNA. The PbeABCD-mediated PT defence system is widespread and exhibits extensive interdomain and intradomain gene transfer events. Our results suggest that DndCDEA-PbeABCD is a new type of PT-based virus resistance system, expanding the known arsenal of defence systems as well as our understanding of host-virus interactions.  The prokaryote defence system Dnd relies on phosphorothioation (PT) of DNA backbone to distinguish between self and non-self DNA. Here, Xiong et al. describe a previously uncharacterized PT-based antiviral system that is independent of the canonical Dnd and is widespread in Archaea and Bacteria.  ",FALSE,FALSE,

PMC6459918,Discussion,Results and Discussion,CP031311,0,0,0,,,"  Discussion  In this study, we describe a new type of PT-based multi-gene antiviral system in Archaea, DndCDEA-PbeABCD, that is genetically and phenotypically distinct from DndBCDE-DndFGH. In spite of the absence of the transcriptional repressor DndB, the DndCDEA-PbeABCD system in four haloarchaeal strains drives motif-specific DNA PT modifications at frequencies comparable to those observed in Bacteria32,34. Approximately half of PT sites occur in the form of hemi-PT-modified 5ʹ-GPSATC-3ʹ/5ʹ-GATC-3ʹ in Archaea, which is in sharp contrast to the predominant full PT modifications that occur in Bacteria32,34. However, although PbeABCD allows viral adsorption and DNA injection into the host archaeal cells, it prevents viral DNA replication in a PT-dependent manner. Notably, the DndCDEA-PbeABCD pair was no longer able to protect against a PT-modified SNJ1 virus, suggesting a strategy of utilising epigenetic modification for self/non-self discrimination. We therefore speculated that PbeABCD serves as the REase component to target non-PT-modified viral DNA, analogous to R-M systems. However, two lines of evidence point to a novel mechanism of defence that is different from type II R-M systems, which have autonomous REase and MTase activities, and PT-based DndFGH systems. First, no sign of the processive degradation or cleavage of viral DNA was detected in the presence of DndCDEA-PbeABCD. Second, in typical R-M or DndFGH-mediated Dnd systems, the loss of methylation or PT would be detrimental to cells because the resulting host DNA would be recognised as invading foreign DNA and be attacked by REases or DndFGH. However, dndCDEA deletion mutants exhibited no apparent growth defect compared to CJ7-F cells expressing intact dndCDEA-pbeABCD, although protection against the virus was lost.  We also showed that all four genes in the pbeABCD module appear to be essential for protection against viral infection. PbeA consists of a PLD domain35, a Res subunit of Type III REase domain and a helicase domain39,40, suggesting that it has multiple enzymatic activities. The PLD domain is present in a wide variety of enzymes involved in phospholipid metabolism, virulence, membrane remodelling and signalling35. In addition, it is also recognised as a characteristic of a small family of endonucleases in bacteria, such as Nuc, CglI, NgoAvII, BfiI and DrmC, a component of the newly identified multi-gene R-M module DISARM2,41–43. The Res subunit of Type III REase (i.e., EcoP15I) is a fusion between a DEAD-family helicase, correlating with the DNA translocation activity, and a nuclease resembling the functionally related HsdR subunit of the type I REases39,40. Nonetheless, the PD-X-D/EXK motif, the nuclease active site for DNA cleavage, is not present in PbeA, which is consistent with the non-DNA-cleavage defensive activity of PbeABCD. Based on the shared helicase motifs between PbeA and type I and III REases, we, speculate that PbeA might be associated with DNA translocation, looping or sliding to target DNA recognition sites. This possibility would explain why without pbeA, the remaining pbeBCD still confer a low-level of resistance to SNJ1. While pbeB and pbeD encode proteins of unknown function sized only 66 and 152 aa, respectively, deletions of them still completely abolished protection against virus SNJ1. Considering their small size, we speculate that PbeB and PbeD might become part of an enzyme complex for stabilisation or functional coupling. Notably, PbeC exhibits sequence resemblance to the structural maintenance of chromosome (SMC) protein (24% identity and 42% similarity) in Hydrococcus rivularis. SMC proteins adopt a V-shaped, two-armed architecture with an ATP-binding cassette (ABC)-like domain at the distal end of each arm and are recognised as one of the most fundamental classes of proteins involving in chromosome segregation, recombinational repair and genome-wide gene regulation (Supplementary Data 5)44. Although the function and interaction of PbeABCD proteins remain to be further elucidated, these preliminary clues indicate a possible mechanism of action whereby viral DNA molecules are manipulated in a certain manner to inhibit viral replication and propagation. In terms of the PT dependence, we speculate that Pbe protein(s) might sense PT DNA to function or that PbeABCD rely on PT to form an active assembly.  It was interesting to observe the potential HGT events of DndCD between different bacterial phyla, as well as between Archaea and Bacteria. However, based on the phenomenon that DndFGH occurs only in Bacteria and not in Archaea, this interdomain HGT situation does not hold for the restriction component DndFGH. Instead, the PT modifications in Archaea have evolved to be paired with PbeABCD, generating a new type of PT-based defence module with mechanisms of action that differ from those of DndFGH. In addition, PbeABCD-mediated PT defence pairs are also widespread among Bacteria. Further phylogenetic analysis of PbeAC revealed two unusual observations: (1) 320 of 553 pbeAC are solitary, lacking the counterpart PT modification dnd genes; and (2) pbeAC, dndFGH and PT modification genes coexist in 25 bacterial strains. Regarding the occurrence of solitary pbeAC, it is possible that they are not functional due to their dependence on PT. This scenario is different from that of the REases in type I and III R-M systems, which are activated via protein–protein interactions with the cognate MTases to enable their restriction activity. At present, we still cannot rule out the possibility that PbeABCD has evolved to pair with other modification counterparts, such as MTases, to generate new defensive modules, which is supported by the observation that 155 of 320 solitary pbeAC components are in close proximity to genes encoding MTases. In terms of the coexistence of DndFGH, PbeABCD and PT modifications, it is currently unclear whether the first two are both functional or which one pairs with PT or methylation as a defensive module, emphasising the possibility of complicated interactions worthy of future investigation.  In the host–parasite coevolutionary arms race, viruses have developed a variety of counter-resistance tactics to circumvent the arsenal of prokaryotic resistance mechanisms5. Considering that the PT-modified SNJ1 virus can bypass PbeABCD-mediated PT defence systems, we can speculate that once the virus completes an infection cycle, the resulting SNJ1 progeny possessing PT modifications would overcome this defence in other archaeal and bacterial cells, regardless of the presence of PbeABCD or DndFGH. Thus, in future studies, it would be interesting to identify viruses with naturally occurring PT modifications or to explore other strategies used by viruses to avoid, circumvent or subvert PT-based defence systems.  Owing to the fairly limited number of archaeal host–virus systems studied, our understanding of archaeal host–virus interactions lags far behind our understanding of those in Bacteria. These limitations also hinder the exploration of new defensive mechanisms in Archaea. In this study, we identified a new type of PT-based Dnd defence system that is widespread in Archaea and Bacteria. The antiviral activity of PbeABCD depends on the presence of DNA PT modification but does not involve viral DNA degradation or cleavage, ruling out the involvement of currently known defence mechanisms. These findings expand our knowledge regarding the arsenal of archaeal defence systems and illuminate the archaeal host–virus arms race.  ",FALSE,TRUE,

PMC6459918,Introduction,Introduction,CP031311,1,0,0,1,"""In this study, we first identify PT modifications in halophilic and methanogenic archaea that show diverse sequence specificities and abundance comparable to those observed in bacteria.""","  Introduction  Viruses are the most abundant biological entities in the biosphere and are estimated to outnumber their bacterial and archaeal hosts by tenfold. The constant threat of virus predation has led to the evolution of diverse defence mechanisms that target nearly every stage of the viral infectious cycle. These mechanisms involve inhibiting adsorption, blocking viral DNA injection, restriction-modification (R-M), limiting phage growth, toxin-antitoxin systems, abortive infection and CRISPR/Cas systems, as well as the newly discovered prokaryotic Argonaute, BREX, DISARM, Zorya and Dnd defence systems1–6.  Among these mechanisms, the use of R-M systems is the most prevalent and best-characterised antiviral approach among Bacteria and Archaea. Generally, R-M systems consist of two contrasting enzymatic activities: (1) a methyltransferase (MTase) that catalyses the transfer of a methyl group to DNA nucleobases within a particular sequence motif of ‘self’ DNA and (2) a restriction endonuclease (REase) cognate that identifies and destroys invading foreign DNA that harbours the same DNA motif when not methylated. Four major types of R-M systems (I, II, III and IV) are classified based on their subunit composition, cofactor requirements, sequence recognition and cleavage mechanisms7. Type I R-M systems comprise three subunits, R (restriction), M (modification) and S (specificity), and the resulting complex binds to a bipartite sequence and requires ATP hydrolysis to cleave at a distant site following DNA translocations8. Type II systems are the simplest, which contain separate MTase and REase enzymes to act independently. Type III systems are multifunctional oligomeric proteins consisting of a Mod and a Res subunit. The Mod subunit alone can function independently as a MTase to recognise non-palindromic sequences, only one strand of which can be methylated, whereas the Res subunit needs to pair with the Mod subunit for restriction activity9. Type IV systems have no methylase activity and type IV REases recognise and cleave only modified DNA10–12. Although type I–III R-M systems are tremendously diverse, the associated DNA modifications most commonly occur in the form of methylation of nucleobase moieties, such as N6-methyl-adenine, N4-methyl-cytosine and C5-methyl-cytosine.  The Dnd defence system has recently been recognised as a new component of the bacterial innate immune system, in which phosphorothioate (PT) modification is used as a marker to distinguish between self and non-self DNA, analogous to methylation-based R-M systems13,14. In contrast to DNA methylation at nucleobases, PT modification occurs on the DNA sugar-phosphate backbone, where replacement of the non-bridging oxygen by sulphur confers nuclease resistance at the PT linkage13,15. The Dnd system is organised into three parts: (1) DndACDE proteins form a complex and act as the modification component to catalyse DNA PT modification in a sequence-selective manner16,17; (2) DndB is a transcriptional repressor capable of regulating expression of the dndBCDE cluster and the resulting PT level18 and (3) DndFGH proteins function as the R component to recognise and destroy non-PT-modified foreign DNA14,19. All three dndFGH genes are essential to distinguish and restrict the transformation of non-PT-modified incoming plasmid DNA in Salmonella enterica4. Once PT modification is abolished, S. enterica suffers double-stranded DNA damage from the unrestrained restriction activity of DndFGH, which consequently leads to growth defects and triggers the SOS response14,20. Although the enzymatic activities and mechanism of action of DndFGH is currently unclear, these features resemble the well-characterised ‘self/non-self discrimination’ strategy of methylation-based R-M systems.  To prevent REase attack on resident DNA, the recognition motifs are generally nearly completely methylated by the MTase counterpart. However, this situation is not observed for Dnd defence systems. Indeed, only 4855 of 40,701 complementary 5ʹ-GAAC-3ʹ/5ʹ-GTTC-3ʹ consensus sequences found in the Escherichia coli B7A genome are PT modified to 5ʹ-GPSAAC-3ʹ/5ʹ-GPSTTC-3ʹ (PS: phosphate-sulphur linkage), even in the presence of active DndFGH, ruling out the known R-M mechanisms.  Although the number of described archaeal viruses accounts for only 1% of all reported prokaryotic viruses, the archaeal viruses exhibit enormously diversified morphotypes and genome contents21–24. Many of the unique morphologies of archaeal viruses, including coil-shaped, bottle-shaped, spherical and droplet-shaped with beard-like fibres, have not been observed among bacterial or eukaryotic viruses21. Consistent with the uniqueness of viral morphotypes, the genome contents of these archaeal viruses are distinctive, with ~75% of genes encoding functionally unknown proteins25. Although the current knowledge of archaeal viruses has merely touched the tip of the iceberg, one may imagine the development of diverse defence systems during the coevolutionary arms race between archaea and viruses given the distinct morphological and genomic properties of viruses.  Indeed, as in Bacteria, an astonishing array of defence systems have developed among Archaea to restrict invasive viruses and plasmids. For example, 96% of the sequenced bacterial genomes harbour R-M systems, while 384 (98%) of the 390 currently available archaeal genomes encode R-M systems (http://rebase.neb.com/rebase/rebase.html)26, as of the time of writing of this manuscript. However, only a few archaeal R-M systems have been investigated to date, including R.PabI from the hyperthermophilic Pyrococcus abyssi, R.PspGI from Pyrococcus sp. strain GI-H, R.SuaI from the thermoacidophilic Sulfolobus acidocaldarius and their cognate MTases27–30. Moreover, archaea wrap their DNA into histone-DNA complexes with the same geometry as DNA in the eukaryotic nucleosomes31, prompting us to investigate the aspects of PT modification and PT-related functions in Archaea.  In this study, we first identify PT modifications in halophilic and methanogenic archaea that show diverse sequence specificities and abundance comparable to those observed in bacteria. However, no trace of the restriction component DndFGH is detected in any of the archaeal strains assessed. Instead, we report that PT-modification genes, such as dndCDEA in the halophilic archaeon Haloterrigena jeotgali A29, can defend against viral attack together with pbeABCD, a conserved 4-gene cassette sharing no sequence homology with DndFGH. Moreover, the defence mechanism involves the DndCDEA-mediated PT modification of the self-DNA sequence and the use of PbeABCD to halt virus propagation by inhibiting DNA replication in a PT-dependent manner. Unlike the DndFGH-mediated defence mechanism, DndCDEA-PbeABCD does not function through the degradation or cleavage of viral DNA, highlighting a novel mode of action that is distinct from R-M activity and expanding the arsenal of known defence systems, as well as our understanding of host–virus interactions.

PMC6459918,Methods,Materials and Methods,CP031311,0,0,0,,,"  Methods  Strains and growth conditions  All the strains, plasmids and primers used in this study are listed in Supplementary Tables 3 and 4. Natrinema sp. CJ7-F and its derivative strains were cultured in Halo-2 or minimal medium (MM, 18%) at 45 °C, as previously described45. H. jeotgali A29, H. limi JCM 16811 and H. salinum JCM 19729 were cultivated in JCM medium 402, and N. bangense JCM 10635 was grown in JCM medium 167. To construct plasmids, E. coli strains were routinely grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium at 37 °C. To prepare solid agar medium, agar was added to the medium to a final concentration of 15 g/L. When necessary, ampicillin was added to the medium at a concentration of 100 μg/mL.  Construction and expression of pWHU3808 and derivatives  The shuttle vector pFJ6-H was used to express dndCDEA-pbeABCD from H. jeotgali A29 and its derivatives in CJ7-F45. Plasmid pWHU3808, expressing the complete dndCDEA-pbeABCD module, was constructed in two steps. First, the dndCDEA and pbeABCD fragments were PCR amplified from H. jeotgali A29 genomic DNA using the primer pairs dndCDEA-pYC-F/dndCDEA-pYC-R and pbeABCD-F/pbeABCD-R, respectively. The fragments were inserted into the SnaBI-HindIII-digested pYCJ-HH and NotI-SphI-digested pFJ6-H, yielding pWHU3253 and pWHU3804, respectively. Second, the heat-shock protein 70 (HSP 70) promoter and the dndCDEA fusion fragments were PCR amplified from pWHU3253 using the primer pair Hpro-dndCDEA-F/Hpro-dndCEDA-R. The PCR product was then ligated into pWHU3804 digested with NdeI and KpnI, yielding pWHU3808. For the in-frame deletion of pbeA in pWHU3808, a 5.2 kb fragment containing the downstream portion of pbeA was first generated by PCR using the primer pair ΔpbeA-F/ΔpbeA-R from pWHU3808 (Supplementary Table 4). The PCR products and the NdeI-NotI digested pWHU3808, sharing 25–30 bp identical sequences, were mixed to allow site-specific recombination using a Hieff Clone™ Plus One Step Cloning Kit (Yeasen), generating plasmid pWHU3813. To generate the in-frame deletion of pbeB in pWHU3808, the upstream and downstream fragments of pbeB were PCR amplified using the primer pairs ΔpbeB-UF/ΔpbeB-UR and ΔpbeB-DF/ΔpbeB-DR, respectively (Supplementary Table 4). The two purified PCR products and the NdeI-NotI-digested pWHU3808 were mixed according to the manufacturer’s instructions for recombination to generate the plasmid pWHU3814. The procedures used to construct the other pWHU3808-derived plasmids expressing in-frame deletions of the dnd genes were similar to those used for pWHU3814. All of the recombinant plasmids were verified by sequencing. The transformation of CJ7-F was performed at room temperature using the polyethylene glycol (PEG) method, as previously described38. MM (18%) medium was used to select and propagate CJ7-F transformants.  Absorption assay  CJ7-F cells expressing or lacking dndCDEA-pbeABCD were grown in Halo-2 medium to an OD600 of 0.3, followed by infection with virus SNJ1 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1. During infection, the archaeal cells and virus were incubated with shaking at 45 °C. Aliquots of 1 mL of culture were withdrawn at time points 1, 60, 120, 180, 240 and 300 min post infection, and the cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 1 min. The unabsorbed SNJ1 concentration in the upper aqueous phase was determined on CJ7-F cell lawns. The percentage of unabsorbed (extracellular) virus SNJ1 was calculated assuming the initial titre of SNJ1 (without added cells) to be 100%.  Determination of relative SNJ1 levels in CJ7-F hosts  CJ7-F cells harbouring pWHU3808 or the empty vector pFJ6-H, expressing or lacking dndCDEA-pbeABCD, respectively, were cultured in 20 mL of Halo-2 medium until the cell density reached an OD600 of 0.3. Logarithmic-phase cultures were infected with the SNJ1 virus at an MOI of 1. Multiple 1-mL samples of the cultures were collected at the indicated time point by centrifugation, and the cells were resuspended in 100 μL of basal salt solution (medium without a carbon source). Total DNA from CJ7-F strains containing the different vectors was prepared as described previously46. Briefly, cells resuspended in 100 μL of basal salt solution were lysed after the addition of 900 μL of distilled water. The lysate was diluted 1:100 with distilled water and then was used as the template for real-time qPCR. The levels of the single-copy gene radA38, located on the chromosome of the host strain, and repA, located in the genome of SNJ1, were determined by real-time qPCR to estimate the relative intracellular levels of SNJ1 DNA relative to the CJ7-F chromosome during infection.  RNA extraction and reverse transcription  Total RNA was extracted from the H. jeotgali A29 strain using an Omega RNA Extraction Kit (Omega Bio-Tec) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Next, the RNA samples were treated with DNase I (Thermo Fisher) to remove residual genomic DNA, and the RNA was then quantified using a NanoDrop2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher). The RNA was reverse transcribed using a RevertAid First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Fermentas) to obtain cDNA.  SNJ1 propagation and isolation  The haloarchaeal virus SNJ1 was propagated in Natrinema sp. J7-145. The J7-1 strain was grown at 45 °C in Halo-2 medium to late log phase (OD600 = 0.8–1.0), after which mitomycin C (Roche) was added to the cultures at a final concentration of 1 μg/mL, followed by overnight incubation at 37 °C with shaking at 200 rpm. The cultures were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 20 min to remove cellular debris, and the supernatants were subsequently filtered through 0.22-µm Millipore pore membrane filters. When necessary, a PEG6000 solution was used to concentrate the phage preparations, as described previously47.  Plaque assays  Halovirus plaque assays were performed as described previously48, with slight modifications. Briefly, the CJ7-F derivative strains were grown at 45 °C in 18% MM medium to late log phase (OD600 = ~0.8–1.0). Next, an aliquot (400 µL) of the culture was mixed with molten soft agar (0.6%) and poured onto Halo-2 agar plates (1.5%). Once solidified, 5 μL of serial tenfold dilutions of SNJ1 were pipetted onto the agar. The plates were incubated for 36 h at 45 °C, and the phage titres were calculated as PFU (plaque-forming unit)/mL.  Southern blot analysis  CJ7-F cells possessing pWHU3808 and pFJ6-H were incubated with the SNJ1 virus at an MOI of 5. Multiple aliquots of 10 mL of culture were collected at different time points (1, 5, 10, 15, 30 min and 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 h) post infection. In addition, samples of the cultures prior to the addition of SNJ1 were used as negative controls. Total genomic DNA was extracted and digested with SacI for Southern blot analysis. The primers SNJ1-southern-F and SNJ1-southern-R were designed to synthesise a probe corresponding to the region from 9243 to 9732 nt of the SNJ1 genome (Supplementary Table 4). The DNA probe preparation, hybridisation and detection were performed using a Detection Starter Kit II (Roche) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.  Bioinformatic and statistical analysis  Using the DndC, DndD, PbeA and PbeC protein sequences from H. jeotgali A29 and the DndF, DndG, and DndH sequences from S. enterica serovar Cerro 87 and Hahella chejuensis KCTC 2396 as BLAST queries, we searched the NCBI databases of non-redundant nucleotide collections, RefSeq_genomes, WGS, HTGS, refseq_genomic, and GSS. The BLAST hits were filtered using an e-value of ≤10−10 and an aligned length of ≥30% to the query sequences. The distance between dndC and dndD was limited to 5 kb or less. Flanking regions of ±20 kb around the dndCD cluster were searched for the presence of pbeA, pbeC, dndF, dndG and dndH. Similarly, we searched for genes encoding MTases or DndCD within close proximity (1 bp–10 kb) to pbeAC.  The sequences used to generate the phylogenetic trees were formed by concatenating the protein sequences of DndC and DndD, and PbeA and PbeC. Multiple alignments were performed using MEGA 5.2 with the MUSCLE algorithm. The parameters were set as follows: gap open = −2.9, gap extend = 0, hydrophobicity multiplier = 1.2, max iterations = 8, and min dialogue length = 24, and the UPGMB method was used for clustering. Trees were constructed using the maximum likelihood method with 500 bootstrap replications. The other parameters were set as follows: substitution type = amino acid, substitution model = Jones-Taylor-Thornton model, rates among sites = uniform rates, gaps/missing data treatment = complete deletion, maximum likelihood heuristic method = Nearest-Neighbour-Interchange, and the neighbour-joining method was used to constructed the initial tree. The output trees were visualised by iTOL49.  DndCD and PbeAC sequences wereglobally aligned with those of H. jeotgali A29 using the needle programme in the EMBOSS package50. Similarity values were extracted from the output files. The coevolution analysis has been described in detail previously34. Generally, we regressed the similarity values of PbeAC to those of DndCD to explore their coevolution on the basis of the idea that the divergence degree (i.e., 1 minus the similarity rate) of PbeAC and DndCD from their respective ancestor should be linearly related in a given strain, if they evolve at the same speed. The same regression analysis was also performed on DndCD and DndFGH. As H. jeotgali A29 lacks dndFGH, global alignments were made with the sequence data from S. enterica serovar Cerro 87.  All statistical and bioinformatic analyses were performed in R.  ",FALSE,TRUE,

""Phosphorothioate (PT) mapping across the genomes of H. jeotgali A29, N. bangense JCM 10635, H. salinum JCM 19729 and H. limi JCM 16811""","  Results  Occurrence of DNA PT modifications in Archaea  Although our understanding of dnd systems and PT modifications in Bacteria has dramatically expanded in the past decade, PT modification and its physiological relevance have not been characterised in Archaea, which comprise up to 20% of the total biomass on Earth21. In this study, we first identified DNA PT modifications in five archaea with homologous PT-modification genes. Based on mass spectral analysis, nuclease-resistant PT-linked dinucleotides were produced upon enzymatic hydrolysis of archaeal DNA (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. 1). The following strains were observed to harbour PT-modified d(GPSA): three halophilic archaeal strains, H. jeotgali A29, isolated from salt-fermented shrimp jeotgal, and Halapricum salinum JCM 19729 and Halobellus limi JCM 16811, isolated from solar salterns in Korea and China, respectively; and one haloalkaliphilic archaeal strain, Natronorubrum bangense JCM 10635, isolated from a soda lake in Tibet. H. limi JCM 16811 also possesses a detectable level of d(GPSG). An acidophilic methanogen, Methanoregula boonei 6A8, isolated from an acid peat bog in the United States, also shows PT modification at d(GPSA) and d(GPSG) of the same order of magnitude (Table 1). These findings reveal the diversity of PT consensus sequences among Archaea. Next, we determined that the dndCDEA operon of H. jeotgali A29 was capable of conferring d(GPSA) modification upon transfer to a new host, Natrinema sp. CJ7-F, an extreme haloarchaeon without endogenous dnd genes (Supplementary Fig. 1).Fig. 1Maximum likelihood phylogeny of 2642 homologues of the H. jeotgali A29 DndCD identified in Archaea and Bacteria. The strain names of 42 archaea, as well as the phosphorothioate (PT) sequence contexts identified in this study are displayed as noted. Each prokaryotic phylum is represented in a distinct colour (see the legend). Bacterial strain names are also provided in Supplementary Data 1.

Using BLAST, we searched the homologues of DndCD in the NCBI databases of non-redundant nucleotide collections (nt), RefSeq Genome (refseq_genomes), whole-genome shotgun contigs (WGS), high-throughput genomic sequences (HTGS), reference genomic sequences (refseq_genomic), and genomic survey sequences (GSS). We filtered the results based on an e-value of ≤ 10−10 and discarded BLAST hits with aligned lengths of ≤ 30% of the query proteins. A total of 2642 occurrences of dndCD were identified nested within 2600 bacterial and 42 archaeal genomes (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Data 1). The 42 Archaea harbouring DndCD homologues span the phylogenetic diversity of archaeal lineages, including Methanomicrobia (23), Haloarchaea (7), Thaumarchaeota (6), Bathyarchaeota (2), Thermoplasmata (2), and Heimdallarchaeota (1), as well as an uncultured marine group II/III euryarchaeote KM3_173_A11 (Supplementary Data 1). According to the phylogenetic tree of the 2642 DndCD proteins (archaeal and bacterial DndCD proteins), the archaeal strains do not phylogenetically cluster together but instead are grouped with bacteria, suggesting potential interdomain HGT of Dnd systems between Archaea and Bacteria (Fig. 1).  Genome-wide PT features in Archaea  In contrast to the well-characterised dndBCDE cluster in bacterial genomes, dndCDEA clusters in H. jeotgali A29, N. bangense JCM 10635, H. limi JCM 16811 and H. salinum JCM 19729 are not accompanied by dndB, which encodes a negative regulator that binds to the promoter region of the dndBCDE operon. Upon relief of DndB repression, the transcription of dndBCDE and the resulting PT frequency increased by 15- and 2-fold, respectively, in the bacterial strain S. enterica serovar Cerro 8718. However, in the four haloarchaeal strains, we observed d(GPSA) at an average frequency of ~2–3 PT per 104 nt, which is comparable to the frequency of ~3–8 PT per 104 nt detected in bacteria16, prompting us to examine the PT features across the archaeal genomes (Table 1).  To this end, we exploited the single-molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing platform to profile the genome-wide PT sites32,33. The SMRT sequencing data immediately revealed the occurrence of d(GPSA) in a 4-bp consensus sequence of 5ʹ-GPSATC-3ʹ in all four haloarchaea genomes (Supplementary Fig. 2). Only 2.6% (2451) out of 94,316, 2.1% (1614) out of 75,884, 2.4% (1442) out of 60,776, and 1.4% (895) out of 64,824 5ʹ-GATC-3ʹ sites in H. jeotgali A29, N. bangense JCM 10635, H. limi JCM 16811 and H. salinum JCM 19729 were detected to be PT modified, respectively (Supplementary Data 2). Although no further sequence constraint beyond the 4-bp 5ʹ-GPSATC-3ʹ was identified, we observed sequence biases for PT modification-proximate bases, with a noticeable preference for 5ʹ-tGPSATCc-3ʹ but an underrepresentation at 5ʹ-gGPSATC(g/t)-3ʹ (Supplementary Table 1). No PT enrichment in particular DNA regions was observed across all four archaeal genomes (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Data 2). For instance, 1229 and 1222 5ʹ-GPSATC-3ʹ sites were observed to be located on the (+) and (−) strands of the H. jeotgali A29 genome, respectively, with various spacing ranging from 4 to 36 kb. In addition, 915 out of 4745 open reading frames, 8 out of 13 rRNA genes and 31 out of 200 pseudogenes in H. jeotgali A29 harbour at least one PT site (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Data 2). While 1310 of 2451, 674 of 1614, 736 of 1442, and 244 of 895 genomic PTs were detected to be fully PT-modified (on both strands) 5ʹ-GPSATC-3ʹ/5ʹ-GPSATC-3ʹ in H. jeotgali A29, N. bangense JCM 10635, H. limi JCM 16811 and H. salinum JCM 19729, respectively, up to 47% (1141), 58% (940), 49% (706), and 73% (651) of PT sites occur in the form of hemimodified 5ʹ-GPSATC-3ʹ/5ʹ-GATC-3ʹ (Supplementary Fig. 2). These results are in sharp contrast to the predominant full PT modification found in 5ʹ-GPSAAC-3ʹ/5ʹ-GPSTTC-3 in E. coli B7A32 and 5ʹ-GPSGCC-3ʹ/5ʹ-GPSGCC-3ʹ in Pseudomonas fluorescens pf0–134, suggesting different PT physiologies among Archaea. Additionally, it was interesting to observe the presence of DNA methylation in a variety of sequence contexts, including 5ʹ-TCCGA6mA-3ʹ, 5ʹ-GAGG6mAG-3ʹ, 5ʹ-C6mATTC-3ʹ, 5ʹ-CAG6mATG-3ʹ, and 5ʹ-CG6mATCC-3ʹ, by SMRT sequencing (Supplementary Table 2), which indicated their potential involvement in methylation-based R-M defence systems, epigenetic regulation, or other biological functions in Archaea.Fig. 2Phosphorothioate (PT) mapping across the genomes of H. jeotgali A29, N. bangense JCM 10635, H. salinum JCM 19729 and H. limi JCM 16811.

Source data are provided as a Source Data file  DndCDEA constitutes a novel antiviral system with PbeABCD  Based on these PT characteristics in Archaea, we sought to explore the genomic neighbourhoods of dndCD by selecting 2361 out of 2642 archaeal and bacterial dndCD with available flanking sequence data. The restriction component dndFGH was observed to be in close proximity (1 bp-20 kb) with 48.8% (1132) of the 2322 bacterial dndCD regions, agreeing well with our previous observations34. Conversely, no trace of dndFGH was observed within the vicinity of all 39 archaeal dndCD. Instead, the majority of these archaeal dndCD clusters are followed by a four-gene cassette arranged in a highly conserved order (Fig. 3).Fig. 3The diversity of phosphorothioate (PT) systems in prokaryotes. a The genetic organisation and gene orders of the PT-based PbeABCD and DndFGH systems are displayed. GenBank accession numbers for pbeABCD in H. jeotgali A29 are indicated. b The phylogenetic tree of 2361 archaeal and bacterial DndCD homologues is colour-coded by phylogenetic group (see the legend). Strains shaded violet, pink, black and green have DndCD homologues associated with PbeABCD, DndFGH, DndFGH-PbeABCD, or none, respectively. The widths of tree branches are proportional to their Bootstrap scores. For clarity, at least one familiar genus per colour segment were labelled. Source data are provided as a Source Data file  Using the gene cassette consisting of DVR14_03960, DVR14_03955, DVR14_03950 and DVR14_03945 in H. jeotgali A29 as an example, the four genes are co-expressed as a single transcriptional unit, consistent with the idea that they are functional related (Supplementary Fig. 3). DVR14_03960 comprises three domains: a phospholipase D (PLD)-like domain (pfam13091), a res subunit of Type III REase (pfam04851) and a DEAD (Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp)-family helicase C-terminal (pfam00271) domain (Supplementary Fig. 4). The PLD domain has been identified as a component of a large superfamily of proteins associated with the hydrolysis of phosphodiester bonds, such as phospholipases, kinases, toxins and REases35. The genes DVR14_03955 and DVR14_03945 encode proteins of unknown function with only 66 and 152 aa in size, respectively. DVR14_03950 contains an N-terminal AAA domain (ATPases associated with diverse cellular activities; pfam13476), a domain that is present in a wide variety of proteins that often direct molecular remodelling events in an ATP-driven process36. Given the positioning of these genes relative to dndCDEA and the predicted nuclease-related functions of their encoded proteins, we speculated that this four-gene cluster may constitute a new defence system involving DNA PT modification in Archaea, and we named the four genes pbeABCD (for phosphorothioate-blocked DNA exclusion).  To explore the involvement of pbeABCD in archaeal host–virus interactions, we cloned the dndCDEA-pbeABCD fragment from H. jeotgali A29 into the shuttle vector pFJ6-H, generating pWHU3808, followed by transformation into Natrinema sp. CJ7-F, a pyrF-deletion and plasmid-free derivative of Natrinema sp. J7-1 (Supplementary Table 3). We next challenged CJ7-F cells expressing dndCDEA-pbeABCD with the halophilic temperate sphaerolipovirus SNJ1. Using a double agar overlay plaque assay, we showed that dndCDEA-pbeABCD provided protection against SNJ1: the ability of SNJ1 to induce plaques was reduced ~104-fold (Fig. 4).Fig. 4DndCDEA-PbeABCD confers protection against the haloarchaeal virus SNJ1. a The dndCDEA-pbeABCD locus of H. jeotgali A29 is displayed. b Five microlitres each of a tenfold serial dilution (106–101) of SNJ1 virus was spotted onto CJ7-F cells carrying pWHU3808-derived plasmids and expressing the genes indicated on the left. The EOPs are listed on the right. The EOPs were determined by dividing the SNJ1 titre obtained by plating on CJ7-F expressing dndCDEA-pbeABCD and derivatives by the titre of SNJ1 plated on CJ7-F(pFJ6-H). The values represent the mean ± SD for three independent experiments. ****p-value < 0.0001, using one-sample t-test (Hypothesis Testing). Ns, not significant. Compared to the strong protection against non-PT SNJ1, CJ7-F cells are susceptible to PT-modified SNJ1, even in the presence of DndCDEA-PbeABCD. Source data are provided as a Source Data file  To further examine the components that are essential for this antiviral activity, we constructed a series of pWHU3808-derived plasmids (pWHU3813~pWHU3816), each expressing DNA PT modification, as well as the individual in-frame deleted genes of the pbeABCD cassette (Supplementary Table 3). Deletion of the individual pbeABCD genes impaired protection against SNJ1, indicating that all four pbe genes are indispensable for mediating antiviral activity (Fig. 4). It is noteworthy that the contributions of four pbe genes against SNJ1 are not equal. To quantify the protection, we measured the efficiency of plating (EOP) of SNJ1 applied to CJ7-F cells expressing different parts of the pbeABCD cassette. In contrast to the absolute necessity of pbeB, pbeC and pbeD, CJ7-F cells expressing dndCDEA-ΔpbeA-pbeBCD still exhibited a low-level of resistance, although less than one order of magnitude, against SNJ1, suggesting that pbeA is partially required for defence (Fig. 4). To assess whether PT modification is sufficient to protect viruses against PbeABCD interference, we propagated SNJ1 in CJ7-F cells expressing only dndCDEA, yielding PT-modified SNJ1 (Supplementary Fig. 5). In sharp contrast to the strong protection observed against the non-PT-modified SNJ1 virus, CJ7-F cells expressing dndCDEA-pbeABCD displayed the same susceptibility to PT-modified SNJ1 as CJ7-F cells lacking dndCDEA-pbeABCD (Fig. 4).  It is, therefore, likely that dndCDEA-pbeABCD encodes R-M activity for which DNA PT modification serves as a recognition tag, allowing discrimination between self and non-self DNA. If the Pbe moiety is capable of independent action, then deletion of PT modification genes would likely be detrimental to archaeal cells because genomic 5ʹ-GATC-3ʹ sites would no longer be protected by PT from the restriction activity of PbeABCD. Surprisingly, it was easy to prepare the plasmids pWHU3809, pWHU3810, pWHU3811 and pWHU3812 harbouring individually in-frame-deleted dndCDEA genes but a complete pbeABCD (Supplementary Table 3). Indeed, these plasmids exerted no notable toxicity towards CJ7-F cells and failed to reduce the ability of SNJ1 virus to cause plaque formation, despite the expression of pbeABCD (Supplementary Fig. 6).  Thus, it is possible that the antiviral activity of PbeABCD depends on DNA PT modification in trans or on DndCEDA proteins. To address this possibility, we attempted to construct a plasmid (pWHU3789) expressing DndCDEAC344S-PbeABCD with a single cysteine replaced by serine in DndA. The catalytic cysteine of DndA (C344), corresponding to C327 in S. lividans DndA, is responsible for the nucleophilic attack on the substrate cysteine37. Thus, although this mutation would abolish DNA PT modification at 5ʹ-GPSATC-3ʹ, the integrity of the DndCDEA assembly would be retained. The immediate observation was that in spite of the deficiency of PT modification, pbeABCD was still transcribed in CJ7-F(dndCDEAC344S, pbeABCD), excluding the possibility that DndA or PT acts as a transcriptional regulator of the pbe operon (Supplementary Fig. 7a, b). However, while the transformation of CJ7-F hosts with the pWHU3789 plasmid occurred at normal frequency, the CJ7-F(pWHU3879) transformant restored the sensitivity to SNJ1 (Supplementary Fig. 7c). This result suggested that PbeABCD exerted antiviral activity depending on the presence of PT modifications rather than protein–protein interactions with DndCDEA. This activity differentiates the PbeABCD-mediated defence mechanism from that of DndFGH because the latter still exerted a bactericidal effect, even in the absence of PT modification.  PbeABCD allows virus adsorption but inhibits DNA replication  To gain further insight into the mechanism of action of the PbeABCD-mediated PT defence system, we examined whether the system provides protection by hindering virus attachment. To this end, we compared the efficiency of SNJ1 adsorption to dndCDEA-pbeABCD-containing and dndCDEA-pbeABCD-lacking CJ7-F cells. The result showed that SNJ1 viruses were able to adsorb to the archaeal cells at the same rates regardless of the presence of the dndCDEA-pbeABCD system (Fig. 5a). This finding suggests that DndCDEA-PbeABCD does not offer protection by interfering with virus attachment.Fig. 5Adsorption and DNA replication of the SNJ1 virus in CJ7-F cells expressing or lacking DndCDEA-PbeABCD. a Adsorption of SNJ1 to dndCDEA-pbeABCD-containing CJ7-F cells (red) is not impaired compared to that observed for CJ7-F cells containing the empty vector pFJ6-H (black). After the infection of logarithmic-stage cultures (OD600 = 0.3) with SNJ1 at an MOI = 1, samples were collected at 60-min intervals, and the extracellular (unabsorbed) viral concentration was measured and compared to the initial viral concentrations. The bars represent the means of three experiments, and the error bars represent the SD of the mean. b Real-time qPCR analysis to determine the replication efficiency of the virus SNJ1 in CJ7-F cells expressing (red) or lacking (black) dndCDEA-pbeABCD. Primers amplifying repA and radA were used to determine the concentration of SNJ1 DNA and CJ7-F chromosomes, respectively. The 2CT(radA) – CT(repA) method was used to determine the relative levels of SNJ1 DNA in CJ7-F hosts. c Southern blot analysis of the SNJ1 genome during the infection cycle. Numbers indicate the time (min) following infection. A probe was designed corresponding to positions 9243–9732 nt in the SNJ1 genome. Source data are provided as a Source Data file  We next monitored the replication efficiency of SNJ1 viral DNA during the time course of the infection using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). The PCR products for repA, which is located within the replication region of SNJ1, and radA, a single-copy gene located on the CJ7-F chromosome, were used to estimate the relative viral DNA concentrations compared to archaeal genome equivalents38. After 5 h of infection, a 2.5-fold increase in the intracellular SNJ1 genome level was observed in CJ7-F (dndCDEA, pbeABCD), whereas a 16.7-fold increase was detected in CJ7-F containing the empty vector (Fig. 5b). These results revealed that SNJ1 DNA can be successfully injected into Natrinema cells but that the subsequent viral genome replication process is significantly inhibited by the DndCDEA-PbeABCD system. This observation, along with the results of the adsorption assays, indicated that the replication inhibition likely results from viral DNA cleavage or degradation.  To examine the integrity of SNJ1 DNA, we performed a Southern blot analysis using total DNA isolated from CJ7-F cells treated with SNJ1 at various time points after infection. With increasing infection time, extensive SNJ1 DNA accumulation was observed in dndCDEA-pbeABCD-lacking but not dndCDEA-pbeABCD-containing CJ7-F cells, indicating that DndCDEA-PbeABCD halts viral infection at an early stage (Fig. 5c). Notably, SNJ1 DNA remained intact with no sign of cleavage or processive degradation, even 6 h after infection of CJ7-F cells expressing the DndCDEA-PbeABCD system (Fig. 5c). Consistent with the real-time qPCR results, the Southern blot analysis showed a marginal increase in SNJ1 DNA with an extended infection time, even in the presence of DndCDEA-PbeABCD. Considering the self/non-self discrimination strategy, one explanation for this result is that once SNJ1 DNA acquires PT modification prior to the action of PbeABCD, it is regarded as self-DNA and can replicate in CJ7-F cells, highlighting an evolutionary arms race between the PbeABCD-mediated defence barrier and parasitic DNA. Collectively, these results suggested that DndCDEA-PbeABCD confers resistance against invading viruses via a mechanism other than the direct cleavage or degradation of viral DNA used in canonical R-M systems.  PT-based PbeABCD systems are widespread in microbial genomes  After discovering this new PT-based defence activity in Archaea, we re-examined pbeABCD-adjacent genes among the 2361 prokaryotic dndCD regions. As the gene products of pbeB and pbeD are too small to be annotated in some genomes, we used the sequences of PbeA and PbeC from H. jeotgali A29 as queries for homology searches. In addition to 26 archaeal genomes, 235 additional pbeAC genes were identified in diverse bacterial genomes. However, the phylogenetic tree did not result in clear clustering of DndCD into distinct groups according to a proximate DndFGH, PbeAC or neither (Fig. 3). Moreover, even strains within the same species can accommodate different types of Dnd defence systems. For example, Enterobacter cloacae e1347 and E. cloacae DS15987 harbour PT-based PbeABCD and DndFGH defence systems, respectively, whereas E. cloacae B2-DHA possesses only a solitary PT modification system lacking the restriction counterparts, which is consistent with the HGT of Dnd systems (Supplementary Data 3).  Considering the functional association, we next examined whether these PT modification components had coevolved and been horizontally transferred together with PbeABCD, similar to what occurred with DndFGH34. Using DndCD and PbeAC of H. jeotgali A29 as references, we calculated the alignment similarity rate between the 261 DndCD-PbeAC pairs and their respective reference Dnd and Pbe proteins using the approach previously described34. The same calculation was applied to the 1132 coexisting DndCD-DndFGH proteins, with DndFGH of S. enterica serovar Cerro 87 used as the reference. In general, the coevolution of the modification and restriction components should lead to a linear relationship between their similarity rates34. The results showed that the correlation coefficient (ρ) between the similarity rates for DndCD and DndFGH was 0.582, which is consistent with our previous report34 and confirms the coevolution of DndCD and DndFGH (Supplementary Fig. 8a). In contrast, a ρ-value of 0.107 between DndCD and PbeAC was observed, suggesting that either the dndCD and pbeAC genes were acquired separately by HGT events or that they evolved at different mutational rates owing to different genetic selection pressures (Supplementary Fig. 8b).  To gain a more global view of this new type of PT-based PbeABCD defence system, we performed homology searches and constructed a phylogenetic tree using all 553 PbeAC proteins detected (Fig. 6). An immediate observation was the occurrence of potential interdomain and intradomain gene transfer events. For instance, instead of clustering with other halophilic Archaea, Halorubrum trapanicum CBA1232 grouped with a large clade of bacterial strains, including those of the genera Lactobacillus, Staphylococcus and Bacillus. Surprisingly, only 42.1% (233) of 553 PbeAC proteins were observed to be accompanied by dndCD within 1 bp–10 kb, raising two possibilities: (1) that the solitary PbeABCD components are not active in host cells because their antiviral activity depends on the presence of PT modification and (2) that PbeABCD has evolved to pair with other DNA modifications, such as methylation, to yield new defensive modules. The latter possibility is supported by the observation that candidate base-modifying proteins are encoded within 10 kb of 155 of 320 solitary PbeAC examples (Supplementary Data 4). Notably, PbeAC and DndFGH were observed to be simultaneously present in the neighbourhood of 25 bacterial dndCD clusters (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Data 3). It would be interesting to explore the interactions between these gene cassettes and their contributions to the host defence against invasive DNA.Fig. 6Phylogenetic analysis of 553 PbeAC proteins. Each archaeal and bacterial group is represented in a distinct colour. Green (128) and blue (155) shading indicate the presence of DndCD for phosphorothioate (PT) modification or MTase for methylation within the vicinity of PbeAC. One-hundred and five PbeAC homologues have DndCD and MTase simultaneously present within the defined neighbourhood (1 bp–10 kb), while 165 PbeAC homologues are solitary, lacking the modification component within the neighbourhood.

PMC6459918,Abstract,Abstract,CP031314,0,0,0,,,"  Archaea and Bacteria have evolved different defence strategies that target virtually all steps of the viral life cycle. The diversified virion morphotypes and genome contents of archaeal viruses result in a highly complex array of archaea-virus interactions. However, our understanding of archaeal antiviral activities lags far behind our knowledges of those in bacteria. Here we report a new archaeal defence system that involves DndCDEA-specific DNA phosphorothioate (PT) modification and the PbeABCD-mediated halt of virus propagation via inhibition of DNA replication. In contrast to the breakage of invasive DNA by DndFGH in bacteria, DndCDEA-PbeABCD does not degrade or cleave viral DNA. The PbeABCD-mediated PT defence system is widespread and exhibits extensive interdomain and intradomain gene transfer events. Our results suggest that DndCDEA-PbeABCD is a new type of PT-based virus resistance system, expanding the known arsenal of defence systems as well as our understanding of host-virus interactions.  The prokaryote defence system Dnd relies on phosphorothioation (PT) of DNA backbone to distinguish between self and non-self DNA. Here, Xiong et al. describe a previously uncharacterized PT-based antiviral system that is independent of the canonical Dnd and is widespread in Archaea and Bacteria.  ",FALSE,FALSE,

PMC6459918,Discussion,Results and Discussion,CP031314,0,0,0,,,"  Discussion  In this study, we describe a new type of PT-based multi-gene antiviral system in Archaea, DndCDEA-PbeABCD, that is genetically and phenotypically distinct from DndBCDE-DndFGH. In spite of the absence of the transcriptional repressor DndB, the DndCDEA-PbeABCD system in four haloarchaeal strains drives motif-specific DNA PT modifications at frequencies comparable to those observed in Bacteria32,34. Approximately half of PT sites occur in the form of hemi-PT-modified 5ʹ-GPSATC-3ʹ/5ʹ-GATC-3ʹ in Archaea, which is in sharp contrast to the predominant full PT modifications that occur in Bacteria32,34. However, although PbeABCD allows viral adsorption and DNA injection into the host archaeal cells, it prevents viral DNA replication in a PT-dependent manner. Notably, the DndCDEA-PbeABCD pair was no longer able to protect against a PT-modified SNJ1 virus, suggesting a strategy of utilising epigenetic modification for self/non-self discrimination. We therefore speculated that PbeABCD serves as the REase component to target non-PT-modified viral DNA, analogous to R-M systems. However, two lines of evidence point to a novel mechanism of defence that is different from type II R-M systems, which have autonomous REase and MTase activities, and PT-based DndFGH systems. First, no sign of the processive degradation or cleavage of viral DNA was detected in the presence of DndCDEA-PbeABCD. Second, in typical R-M or DndFGH-mediated Dnd systems, the loss of methylation or PT would be detrimental to cells because the resulting host DNA would be recognised as invading foreign DNA and be attacked by REases or DndFGH. However, dndCDEA deletion mutants exhibited no apparent growth defect compared to CJ7-F cells expressing intact dndCDEA-pbeABCD, although protection against the virus was lost.  We also showed that all four genes in the pbeABCD module appear to be essential for protection against viral infection. PbeA consists of a PLD domain35, a Res subunit of Type III REase domain and a helicase domain39,40, suggesting that it has multiple enzymatic activities. The PLD domain is present in a wide variety of enzymes involved in phospholipid metabolism, virulence, membrane remodelling and signalling35. In addition, it is also recognised as a characteristic of a small family of endonucleases in bacteria, such as Nuc, CglI, NgoAvII, BfiI and DrmC, a component of the newly identified multi-gene R-M module DISARM2,41–43. The Res subunit of Type III REase (i.e., EcoP15I) is a fusion between a DEAD-family helicase, correlating with the DNA translocation activity, and a nuclease resembling the functionally related HsdR subunit of the type I REases39,40. Nonetheless, the PD-X-D/EXK motif, the nuclease active site for DNA cleavage, is not present in PbeA, which is consistent with the non-DNA-cleavage defensive activity of PbeABCD. Based on the shared helicase motifs between PbeA and type I and III REases, we, speculate that PbeA might be associated with DNA translocation, looping or sliding to target DNA recognition sites. This possibility would explain why without pbeA, the remaining pbeBCD still confer a low-level of resistance to SNJ1. While pbeB and pbeD encode proteins of unknown function sized only 66 and 152 aa, respectively, deletions of them still completely abolished protection against virus SNJ1. Considering their small size, we speculate that PbeB and PbeD might become part of an enzyme complex for stabilisation or functional coupling. Notably, PbeC exhibits sequence resemblance to the structural maintenance of chromosome (SMC) protein (24% identity and 42% similarity) in Hydrococcus rivularis. SMC proteins adopt a V-shaped, two-armed architecture with an ATP-binding cassette (ABC)-like domain at the distal end of each arm and are recognised as one of the most fundamental classes of proteins involving in chromosome segregation, recombinational repair and genome-wide gene regulation (Supplementary Data 5)44. Although the function and interaction of PbeABCD proteins remain to be further elucidated, these preliminary clues indicate a possible mechanism of action whereby viral DNA molecules are manipulated in a certain manner to inhibit viral replication and propagation. In terms of the PT dependence, we speculate that Pbe protein(s) might sense PT DNA to function or that PbeABCD rely on PT to form an active assembly.  It was interesting to observe the potential HGT events of DndCD between different bacterial phyla, as well as between Archaea and Bacteria. However, based on the phenomenon that DndFGH occurs only in Bacteria and not in Archaea, this interdomain HGT situation does not hold for the restriction component DndFGH. Instead, the PT modifications in Archaea have evolved to be paired with PbeABCD, generating a new type of PT-based defence module with mechanisms of action that differ from those of DndFGH. In addition, PbeABCD-mediated PT defence pairs are also widespread among Bacteria. Further phylogenetic analysis of PbeAC revealed two unusual observations: (1) 320 of 553 pbeAC are solitary, lacking the counterpart PT modification dnd genes; and (2) pbeAC, dndFGH and PT modification genes coexist in 25 bacterial strains. Regarding the occurrence of solitary pbeAC, it is possible that they are not functional due to their dependence on PT. This scenario is different from that of the REases in type I and III R-M systems, which are activated via protein–protein interactions with the cognate MTases to enable their restriction activity. At present, we still cannot rule out the possibility that PbeABCD has evolved to pair with other modification counterparts, such as MTases, to generate new defensive modules, which is supported by the observation that 155 of 320 solitary pbeAC components are in close proximity to genes encoding MTases. In terms of the coexistence of DndFGH, PbeABCD and PT modifications, it is currently unclear whether the first two are both functional or which one pairs with PT or methylation as a defensive module, emphasising the possibility of complicated interactions worthy of future investigation.  In the host–parasite coevolutionary arms race, viruses have developed a variety of counter-resistance tactics to circumvent the arsenal of prokaryotic resistance mechanisms5. Considering that the PT-modified SNJ1 virus can bypass PbeABCD-mediated PT defence systems, we can speculate that once the virus completes an infection cycle, the resulting SNJ1 progeny possessing PT modifications would overcome this defence in other archaeal and bacterial cells, regardless of the presence of PbeABCD or DndFGH. Thus, in future studies, it would be interesting to identify viruses with naturally occurring PT modifications or to explore other strategies used by viruses to avoid, circumvent or subvert PT-based defence systems.  Owing to the fairly limited number of archaeal host–virus systems studied, our understanding of archaeal host–virus interactions lags far behind our understanding of those in Bacteria. These limitations also hinder the exploration of new defensive mechanisms in Archaea. In this study, we identified a new type of PT-based Dnd defence system that is widespread in Archaea and Bacteria. The antiviral activity of PbeABCD depends on the presence of DNA PT modification but does not involve viral DNA degradation or cleavage, ruling out the involvement of currently known defence mechanisms. These findings expand our knowledge regarding the arsenal of archaeal defence systems and illuminate the archaeal host–virus arms race.  ",FALSE,TRUE,

The constant threat of virus predation has led to the evolution of diverse defence mechanisms that target nearly every stage of the viral infectious cycle. These mechanisms involve inhibiting adsorption, blocking viral DNA injection, restriction-modification (R-M), limiting phage growth, toxin-antitoxin systems, abortive infection and CRISPR/Cas systems, as well as the newly discovered prokaryotic Argonaute, BREX, DISARM, Zorya and Dnd defence systems1–6.  Among these mechanisms, the use of R-M systems is the most prevalent and best-characterised antiviral approach among Bacteria and Archaea. Generally, R-M systems consist of two contrasting enzymatic activities: (1) a methyltransferase (MTase) that catalyses the transfer of a methyl group to DNA nucleobases within a particular sequence motif of ‘self’ DNA and (2) a restriction endonuclease (REase) cognate that identifies and destroys invading foreign DNA that harbours the same DNA motif when not methylated. Four major types of R-M systems (I, II, III and IV) are classified based on their subunit composition, cofactor requirements, sequence recognition and cleavage mechanisms7. Type I R-M systems comprise three subunits, R (restriction), M (modification) and S (specificity), and the resulting complex binds to a bipartite sequence and requires ATP hydrolysis to cleave at a distant site following DNA translocations8. Type II systems are the simplest, which contain separate MTase and REase enzymes to act independently. Type III systems are multifunctional oligomeric proteins consisting of a Mod and a Res subunit. The Mod subunit alone can function independently as a MTase to recognise non-palindromic sequences, only one strand of which can be methylated, whereas the Res subunit needs to pair with the Mod subunit for restriction activity9. Type IV systems have no methylase activity and type IV REases recognise and cleave only modified DNA10–12. Although type I–III R-M systems are tremendously diverse, the associated DNA modifications most commonly occur in the form of methylation of nucleobase moieties, such as N6-methyl-adenine, N4-methyl-cytosine and C5-methyl-cytosine.  The Dnd defence system has recently been recognised as a new component of the bacterial innate immune system, in which phosphorothioate (PT) modification is used as a marker to distinguish between self and non-self DNA, analogous to methylation-based R-M systems13,14. In contrast to DNA methylation at nucleobases, PT modification occurs on the DNA sugar-phosphate backbone, where replacement of the non-bridging oxygen by sulphur confers nuclease resistance at the PT linkage13,15. The Dnd system is organised into three parts: (1) DndACDE proteins form a complex and act as the modification component to catalyse DNA PT modification in a sequence-selective manner16,17; (2) DndB is a transcriptional repressor capable of regulating expression of the dndBCDE cluster and the resulting PT level18 and (3) DndFGH proteins function as the R component to recognise and destroy non-PT-modified foreign DNA14,19. All three dndFGH genes are essential to distinguish and restrict the transformation of non-PT-modified incoming plasmid DNA in Salmonella enterica4. Once PT modification is abolished, S. enterica suffers double-stranded DNA damage from the unrestrained restriction activity of DndFGH, which consequently leads to growth defects and triggers the SOS response14,20. Although the enzymatic activities and mechanism of action of DndFGH is currently unclear, these features resemble the well-characterised ‘self/non-self discrimination’ strategy of methylation-based R-M systems.  To prevent REase attack on resident DNA, the recognition motifs are generally nearly completely methylated by the MTase counterpart. However, this situation is not observed for Dnd defence systems. Indeed, only 4855 of 40,701 complementary 5ʹ-GAAC-3ʹ/5ʹ-GTTC-3ʹ consensus sequences found in the Escherichia coli B7A genome are PT modified to 5ʹ-GPSAAC-3ʹ/5ʹ-GPSTTC-3ʹ (PS: phosphate-sulphur linkage), even in the presence of active DndFGH, ruling out the known R-M mechanisms.  Although the number of described archaeal viruses accounts for only 1% of all reported prokaryotic viruses, the archaeal viruses exhibit enormously diversified morphotypes and genome contents21–24. Many of the unique morphologies of archaeal viruses, including coil-shaped, bottle-shaped, spherical and droplet-shaped with beard-like fibres, have not been observed among bacterial or eukaryotic viruses21. Consistent with the uniqueness of viral morphotypes, the genome contents of these archaeal viruses are distinctive, with ~75% of genes encoding functionally unknown proteins25. Although the current knowledge of archaeal viruses has merely touched the tip of the iceberg, one may imagine the development of diverse defence systems during the coevolutionary arms race between archaea and viruses given the distinct morphological and genomic properties of viruses.  Indeed, as in Bacteria, an astonishing array of defence systems have developed among Archaea to restrict invasive viruses and plasmids. For example, 96% of the sequenced bacterial genomes harbour R-M systems, while 384 (98%) of the 390 currently available archaeal genomes encode R-M systems (http://rebase.neb.com/rebase/rebase.html)26, as of the time of writing of this manuscript. However, only a few archaeal R-M systems have been investigated to date, including R.PabI from the hyperthermophilic Pyrococcus abyssi, R.PspGI from Pyrococcus sp. strain GI-H, R.SuaI from the thermoacidophilic Sulfolobus acidocaldarius and their cognate MTases27–30. Moreover, archaea wrap their DNA into histone-DNA complexes with the same geometry as DNA in the eukaryotic nucleosomes31, prompting us to investigate the aspects of PT modification and PT-related functions in Archaea.  In this study, we first identify PT modifications in halophilic and methanogenic archaea that show diverse sequence specificities and abundance comparable to those observed in bacteria. However, no trace of the restriction component DndFGH is detected in any of the archaeal strains assessed. Instead, we report that PT-modification genes, such as dndCDEA in the halophilic archaeon Haloterrigena jeotgali A29, can defend against viral attack together with pbeABCD, a conserved 4-gene cassette sharing no sequence homology with DndFGH. Moreover, the defence mechanism involves the DndCDEA-mediated PT modification of the self-DNA sequence and the use of PbeABCD to halt virus propagation by inhibiting DNA replication in a PT-dependent manner. Unlike the DndFGH-mediated defence mechanism, DndCDEA-PbeABCD does not function through the degradation or cleavage of viral DNA, highlighting a novel mode of action that is distinct from R-M activity and expanding the arsenal of known defence systems, as well as our understanding of host–virus interactions.

Natrinema sp. CJ7-F and its derivative strains were cultured in Halo-2 or minimal medium (MM, 18%) at 45 °C, as previously described45. H. jeotgali A29, H. limi JCM 16811 and H. salinum JCM 19729 were cultivated in JCM medium 402, and N. bangense JCM 10635 was grown in JCM medium 167. To construct plasmids, E. coli strains were routinely grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium at 37 °C. To prepare solid agar medium, agar was added to the medium to a final concentration of 15 g/L. When necessary, ampicillin was added to the medium at a concentration of 100 μg/mL.  Construction and expression of pWHU3808 and derivatives  The shuttle vector pFJ6-H was used to express dndCDEA-pbeABCD from H. jeotgali A29 and its derivatives in CJ7-F45. Plasmid pWHU3808, expressing the complete dndCDEA-pbeABCD module, was constructed in two steps. First, the dndCDEA and pbeABCD fragments were PCR amplified from H. jeotgali A29 genomic DNA using the primer pairs dndCDEA-pYC-F/dndCDEA-pYC-R and pbeABCD-F/pbeABCD-R, respectively. The fragments were inserted into the SnaBI-HindIII-digested pYCJ-HH and NotI-SphI-digested pFJ6-H, yielding pWHU3253 and pWHU3804, respectively. Second, the heat-shock protein 70 (HSP 70) promoter and the dndCDEA fusion fragments were PCR amplified from pWHU3253 using the primer pair Hpro-dndCDEA-F/Hpro-dndCEDA-R. The PCR product was then ligated into pWHU3804 digested with NdeI and KpnI, yielding pWHU3808. For the in-frame deletion of pbeA in pWHU3808, a 5.2 kb fragment containing the downstream portion of pbeA was first generated by PCR using the primer pair ΔpbeA-F/ΔpbeA-R from pWHU3808 (Supplementary Table 4). The PCR products and the NdeI-NotI digested pWHU3808, sharing 25–30 bp identical sequences, were mixed to allow site-specific recombination using a Hieff Clone™ Plus One Step Cloning Kit (Yeasen), generating plasmid pWHU3813. To generate the in-frame deletion of pbeB in pWHU3808, the upstream and downstream fragments of pbeB were PCR amplified using the primer pairs ΔpbeB-UF/ΔpbeB-UR and ΔpbeB-DF/ΔpbeB-DR, respectively (Supplementary Table 4). The two purified PCR products and the NdeI-NotI-digested pWHU3808 were mixed according to the manufacturer’s instructions for recombination to generate the plasmid pWHU3814. The procedures used to construct the other pWHU3808-derived plasmids expressing in-frame deletions of the dnd genes were similar to those used for pWHU3814. All of the recombinant plasmids were verified by sequencing. The transformation of CJ7-F was performed at room temperature using the polyethylene glycol (PEG) method, as previously described38. MM (18%) medium was used to select and propagate CJ7-F transformants.  Absorption assay  CJ7-F cells expressing or lacking dndCDEA-pbeABCD were grown in Halo-2 medium to an OD600 of 0.3, followed by infection with virus SNJ1 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1. During infection, the archaeal cells and virus were incubated with shaking at 45 °C. Aliquots of 1 mL of culture were withdrawn at time points 1, 60, 120, 180, 240 and 300 min post infection, and the cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 1 min. The unabsorbed SNJ1 concentration in the upper aqueous phase was determined on CJ7-F cell lawns. The percentage of unabsorbed (extracellular) virus SNJ1 was calculated assuming the initial titre of SNJ1 (without added cells) to be 100%.  Determination of relative SNJ1 levels in CJ7-F hosts  CJ7-F cells harbouring pWHU3808 or the empty vector pFJ6-H, expressing or lacking dndCDEA-pbeABCD, respectively, were cultured in 20 mL of Halo-2 medium until the cell density reached an OD600 of 0.3. Logarithmic-phase cultures were infected with the SNJ1 virus at an MOI of 1. Multiple 1-mL samples of the cultures were collected at the indicated time point by centrifugation, and the cells were resuspended in 100 μL of basal salt solution (medium without a carbon source). Total DNA from CJ7-F strains containing the different vectors was prepared as described previously46. Briefly, cells resuspended in 100 μL of basal salt solution were lysed after the addition of 900 μL of distilled water. The lysate was diluted 1:100 with distilled water and then was used as the template for real-time qPCR. The levels of the single-copy gene radA38, located on the chromosome of the host strain, and repA, located in the genome of SNJ1, were determined by real-time qPCR to estimate the relative intracellular levels of SNJ1 DNA relative to the CJ7-F chromosome during infection.  RNA extraction and reverse transcription  Total RNA was extracted from the H. jeotgali A29 strain using an Omega RNA Extraction Kit (Omega Bio-Tec) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Next, the RNA samples were treated with DNase I (Thermo Fisher) to remove residual genomic DNA, and the RNA was then quantified using a NanoDrop2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher). The RNA was reverse transcribed using a RevertAid First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Fermentas) to obtain cDNA.  SNJ1 propagation and isolation  The haloarchaeal virus SNJ1 was propagated in Natrinema sp. J7-145. The J7-1 strain was grown at 45 °C in Halo-2 medium to late log phase (OD600 = 0.8–1.0), after which mitomycin C (Roche) was added to the cultures at a final concentration of 1 μg/mL, followed by overnight incubation at 37 °C with shaking at 200 rpm. The cultures were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 20 min to remove cellular debris, and the supernatants were subsequently filtered through 0.22-µm Millipore pore membrane filters. When necessary, a PEG6000 solution was used to concentrate the phage preparations, as described previously47.  Plaque assays  Halovirus plaque assays were performed as described previously48, with slight modifications. Briefly, the CJ7-F derivative strains were grown at 45 °C in 18% MM medium to late log phase (OD600 = ~0.8–1.0). Next, an aliquot (400 µL) of the culture was mixed with molten soft agar (0.6%) and poured onto Halo-2 agar plates (1.5%). Once solidified, 5 μL of serial tenfold dilutions of SNJ1 were pipetted onto the agar. The plates were incubated for 36 h at 45 °C, and the phage titres were calculated as PFU (plaque-forming unit)/mL.  Southern blot analysis  CJ7-F cells possessing pWHU3808 and pFJ6-H were incubated with the SNJ1 virus at an MOI of 5. Multiple aliquots of 10 mL of culture were collected at different time points (1, 5, 10, 15, 30 min and 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 h) post infection. In addition, samples of the cultures prior to the addition of SNJ1 were used as negative controls. Total genomic DNA was extracted and digested with SacI for Southern blot analysis. The primers SNJ1-southern-F and SNJ1-southern-R were designed to synthesise a probe corresponding to the region from 9243 to 9732 nt of the SNJ1 genome (Supplementary Table 4). The DNA probe preparation, hybridisation and detection were performed using a Detection Starter Kit II (Roche) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.  Bioinformatic and statistical analysis  Using the DndC, DndD, PbeA and PbeC protein sequences from H. jeotgali A29 and the DndF, DndG, and DndH sequences from S. enterica serovar Cerro 87 and Hahella chejuensis KCTC 2396 as BLAST queries, we searched the NCBI databases of non-redundant nucleotide collections, RefSeq_genomes, WGS, HTGS, refseq_genomic, and GSS. The BLAST hits were filtered using an e-value of ≤10−10 and an aligned length of ≥30% to the query sequences. The distance between dndC and dndD was limited to 5 kb or less. Flanking regions of ±20 kb around the dndCD cluster were searched for the presence of pbeA, pbeC, dndF, dndG and dndH. Similarly, we searched for genes encoding MTases or DndCD within close proximity (1 bp–10 kb) to pbeAC.  The sequences used to generate the phylogenetic trees were formed by concatenating the protein sequences of DndC and DndD, and PbeA and PbeC. Multiple alignments were performed using MEGA 5.2 with the MUSCLE algorithm. The parameters were set as follows: gap open = −2.9, gap extend = 0, hydrophobicity multiplier = 1.2, max iterations = 8, and min dialogue length = 24, and the UPGMB method was used for clustering. Trees were constructed using the maximum likelihood method with 500 bootstrap replications. The other parameters were set as follows: substitution type = amino acid, substitution model = Jones-Taylor-Thornton model, rates among sites = uniform rates, gaps/missing data treatment = complete deletion, maximum likelihood heuristic method = Nearest-Neighbour-Interchange, and the neighbour-joining method was used to constructed the initial tree. The output trees were visualised by iTOL49.  DndCD and PbeAC sequences wereglobally aligned with those of H. jeotgali A29 using the needle programme in the EMBOSS package50. Similarity values were extracted from the output files. The coevolution analysis has been described in detail previously34. Generally, we regressed the similarity values of PbeAC to those of DndCD to explore their coevolution on the basis of the idea that the divergence degree (i.e., 1 minus the similarity rate) of PbeAC and DndCD from their respective ancestor should be linearly related in a given strain, if they evolve at the same speed. The same regression analysis was also performed on DndCD and DndFGH. As H. jeotgali A29 lacks dndFGH, global alignments were made with the sequence data from S. enterica serovar Cerro 87.  All statistical and bioinformatic analyses were performed in R.  ",FALSE,TRUE,

""Phosphorothioate (PT) mapping across the genomes of H. jeotgali A29, N. bangense JCM 10635, H. salinum JCM 19729 and H. limi JCM 16811""","  Results  Occurrence of DNA PT modifications in Archaea  Although our understanding of dnd systems and PT modifications in Bacteria has dramatically expanded in the past decade, PT modification and its physiological relevance have not been characterised in Archaea, which comprise up to 20% of the total biomass on Earth21. In this study, we first identified DNA PT modifications in five archaea with homologous PT-modification genes. Based on mass spectral analysis, nuclease-resistant PT-linked dinucleotides were produced upon enzymatic hydrolysis of archaeal DNA (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. 1). The following strains were observed to harbour PT-modified d(GPSA): three halophilic archaeal strains, H. jeotgali A29, isolated from salt-fermented shrimp jeotgal, and Halapricum salinum JCM 19729 and Halobellus limi JCM 16811, isolated from solar salterns in Korea and China, respectively; and one haloalkaliphilic archaeal strain, Natronorubrum bangense JCM 10635, isolated from a soda lake in Tibet. H. limi JCM 16811 also possesses a detectable level of d(GPSG). An acidophilic methanogen, Methanoregula boonei 6A8, isolated from an acid peat bog in the United States, also shows PT modification at d(GPSA) and d(GPSG) of the same order of magnitude (Table 1). These findings reveal the diversity of PT consensus sequences among Archaea. Next, we determined that the dndCDEA operon of H. jeotgali A29 was capable of conferring d(GPSA) modification upon transfer to a new host, Natrinema sp. CJ7-F, an extreme haloarchaeon without endogenous dnd genes (Supplementary Fig. 1).Fig. 1Maximum likelihood phylogeny of 2642 homologues of the H. jeotgali A29 DndCD identified in Archaea and Bacteria. The strain names of 42 archaea, as well as the phosphorothioate (PT) sequence contexts identified in this study are displayed as noted. Each prokaryotic phylum is represented in a distinct colour (see the legend). Bacterial strain names are also provided in Supplementary Data 1. For clarity, at least one familiar genus per colour segment were labelled. The structure of PT-modified d(GPSA) in the RP configuration is shown in the centre of the tree.

Source data are provided as a Source Data fileNA, not applicableaIndicates that the PT-linked dinucleotides were detected but were below the limit of quantification  We next used the DndCD protein sequences (DndE is too small to be annotated in some genomes) of H. jeotgali A29 as a query to explore the occurrence and diversity of Dnd systems across archaeal genomes. Using BLAST, we searched the homologues of DndCD in the NCBI databases of non-redundant nucleotide collections (nt), RefSeq Genome (refseq_genomes), whole-genome shotgun contigs (WGS), high-throughput genomic sequences (HTGS), reference genomic sequences (refseq_genomic), and genomic survey sequences (GSS). We filtered the results based on an e-value of ≤ 10−10 and discarded BLAST hits with aligned lengths of ≤ 30% of the query proteins. A total of 2642 occurrences of dndCD were identified nested within 2600 bacterial and 42 archaeal genomes (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Data 1). The 42 Archaea harbouring DndCD homologues span the phylogenetic diversity of archaeal lineages, including Methanomicrobia (23), Haloarchaea (7), Thaumarchaeota (6), Bathyarchaeota (2), Thermoplasmata (2), and Heimdallarchaeota (1), as well as an uncultured marine group II/III euryarchaeote KM3_173_A11 (Supplementary Data 1). According to the phylogenetic tree of the 2642 DndCD proteins (archaeal and bacterial DndCD proteins), the archaeal strains do not phylogenetically cluster together but instead are grouped with bacteria, suggesting potential interdomain HGT of Dnd systems between Archaea and Bacteria (Fig. 1).  Genome-wide PT features in Archaea  In contrast to the well-characterised dndBCDE cluster in bacterial genomes, dndCDEA clusters in H. jeotgali A29, N. bangense JCM 10635, H. limi JCM 16811 and H. salinum JCM 19729 are not accompanied by dndB, which encodes a negative regulator that binds to the promoter region of the dndBCDE operon. Upon relief of DndB repression, the transcription of dndBCDE and the resulting PT frequency increased by 15- and 2-fold, respectively, in the bacterial strain S. enterica serovar Cerro 8718. However, in the four haloarchaeal strains, we observed d(GPSA) at an average frequency of ~2–3 PT per 104 nt, which is comparable to the frequency of ~3–8 PT per 104 nt detected in bacteria16, prompting us to examine the PT features across the archaeal genomes (Table 1).  To this end, we exploited the single-molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing platform to profile the genome-wide PT sites32,33. The SMRT sequencing data immediately revealed the occurrence of d(GPSA) in a 4-bp consensus sequence of 5ʹ-GPSATC-3ʹ in all four haloarchaea genomes (Supplementary Fig. 2). Only 2.6% (2451) out of 94,316, 2.1% (1614) out of 75,884, 2.4% (1442) out of 60,776, and 1.4% (895) out of 64,824 5ʹ-GATC-3ʹ sites in H. jeotgali A29, N. bangense JCM 10635, H. limi JCM 16811 and H. salinum JCM 19729 were detected to be PT modified, respectively (Supplementary Data 2). Although no further sequence constraint beyond the 4-bp 5ʹ-GPSATC-3ʹ was identified, we observed sequence biases for PT modification-proximate bases, with a noticeable preference for 5ʹ-tGPSATCc-3ʹ but an underrepresentation at 5ʹ-gGPSATC(g/t)-3ʹ (Supplementary Table 1). No PT enrichment in particular DNA regions was observed across all four archaeal genomes (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Data 2). For instance, 1229 and 1222 5ʹ-GPSATC-3ʹ sites were observed to be located on the (+) and (−) strands of the H. jeotgali A29 genome, respectively, with various spacing ranging from 4 to 36 kb. In addition, 915 out of 4745 open reading frames, 8 out of 13 rRNA genes and 31 out of 200 pseudogenes in H. jeotgali A29 harbour at least one PT site (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Data 2). While 1310 of 2451, 674 of 1614, 736 of 1442, and 244 of 895 genomic PTs were detected to be fully PT-modified (on both strands) 5ʹ-GPSATC-3ʹ/5ʹ-GPSATC-3ʹ in H. jeotgali A29, N. bangense JCM 10635, H. limi JCM 16811 and H. salinum JCM 19729, respectively, up to 47% (1141), 58% (940), 49% (706), and 73% (651) of PT sites occur in the form of hemimodified 5ʹ-GPSATC-3ʹ/5ʹ-GATC-3ʹ (Supplementary Fig. 2). These results are in sharp contrast to the predominant full PT modification found in 5ʹ-GPSAAC-3ʹ/5ʹ-GPSTTC-3 in E. coli B7A32 and 5ʹ-GPSGCC-3ʹ/5ʹ-GPSGCC-3ʹ in Pseudomonas fluorescens pf0–134, suggesting different PT physiologies among Archaea. Additionally, it was interesting to observe the presence of DNA methylation in a variety of sequence contexts, including 5ʹ-TCCGA6mA-3ʹ, 5ʹ-GAGG6mAG-3ʹ, 5ʹ-C6mATTC-3ʹ, 5ʹ-CAG6mATG-3ʹ, and 5ʹ-CG6mATCC-3ʹ, by SMRT sequencing (Supplementary Table 2), which indicated their potential involvement in methylation-based R-M defence systems, epigenetic regulation, or other biological functions in Archaea.Fig. 2Phosphorothioate (PT) mapping across the genomes of H. jeotgali A29, N. bangense JCM 10635, H. salinum JCM 19729 and H. limi JCM 16811.

Source data are provided as a Source Data file  DndCDEA constitutes a novel antiviral system with PbeABCD  Based on these PT characteristics in Archaea, we sought to explore the genomic neighbourhoods of dndCD by selecting 2361 out of 2642 archaeal and bacterial dndCD with available flanking sequence data. The restriction component dndFGH was observed to be in close proximity (1 bp-20 kb) with 48.8% (1132) of the 2322 bacterial dndCD regions, agreeing well with our previous observations34. Conversely, no trace of dndFGH was observed within the vicinity of all 39 archaeal dndCD. Instead, the majority of these archaeal dndCD clusters are followed by a four-gene cassette arranged in a highly conserved order (Fig. 3).Fig. 3The diversity of phosphorothioate (PT) systems in prokaryotes. a The genetic organisation and gene orders of the PT-based PbeABCD and DndFGH systems are displayed. GenBank accession numbers for pbeABCD in H. jeotgali A29 are indicated. b The phylogenetic tree of 2361 archaeal and bacterial DndCD homologues is colour-coded by phylogenetic group (see the legend). Strains shaded violet, pink, black and green have DndCD homologues associated with PbeABCD, DndFGH, DndFGH-PbeABCD, or none, respectively. The widths of tree branches are proportional to their Bootstrap scores. For clarity, at least one familiar genus per colour segment were labelled. Source data are provided as a Source Data file  Using the gene cassette consisting of DVR14_03960, DVR14_03955, DVR14_03950 and DVR14_03945 in H. jeotgali A29 as an example, the four genes are co-expressed as a single transcriptional unit, consistent with the idea that they are functional related (Supplementary Fig. 3). DVR14_03960 comprises three domains: a phospholipase D (PLD)-like domain (pfam13091), a res subunit of Type III REase (pfam04851) and a DEAD (Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp)-family helicase C-terminal (pfam00271) domain (Supplementary Fig. 4). The PLD domain has been identified as a component of a large superfamily of proteins associated with the hydrolysis of phosphodiester bonds, such as phospholipases, kinases, toxins and REases35. The genes DVR14_03955 and DVR14_03945 encode proteins of unknown function with only 66 and 152 aa in size, respectively. DVR14_03950 contains an N-terminal AAA domain (ATPases associated with diverse cellular activities; pfam13476), a domain that is present in a wide variety of proteins that often direct molecular remodelling events in an ATP-driven process36. Given the positioning of these genes relative to dndCDEA and the predicted nuclease-related functions of their encoded proteins, we speculated that this four-gene cluster may constitute a new defence system involving DNA PT modification in Archaea, and we named the four genes pbeABCD (for phosphorothioate-blocked DNA exclusion).  To explore the involvement of pbeABCD in archaeal host–virus interactions, we cloned the dndCDEA-pbeABCD fragment from H. jeotgali A29 into the shuttle vector pFJ6-H, generating pWHU3808, followed by transformation into Natrinema sp. CJ7-F, a pyrF-deletion and plasmid-free derivative of Natrinema sp. J7-1 (Supplementary Table 3). We next challenged CJ7-F cells expressing dndCDEA-pbeABCD with the halophilic temperate sphaerolipovirus SNJ1. Using a double agar overlay plaque assay, we showed that dndCDEA-pbeABCD provided protection against SNJ1: the ability of SNJ1 to induce plaques was reduced ~104-fold (Fig. 4).Fig. 4DndCDEA-PbeABCD confers protection against the haloarchaeal virus SNJ1. a The dndCDEA-pbeABCD locus of H. jeotgali A29 is displayed. b Five microlitres each of a tenfold serial dilution (106–101) of SNJ1 virus was spotted onto CJ7-F cells carrying pWHU3808-derived plasmids and expressing the genes indicated on the left. The EOPs are listed on the right. The EOPs were determined by dividing the SNJ1 titre obtained by plating on CJ7-F expressing dndCDEA-pbeABCD and derivatives by the titre of SNJ1 plated on CJ7-F(pFJ6-H). The values represent the mean ± SD for three independent experiments. ****p-value < 0.0001, using one-sample t-test (Hypothesis Testing). Ns, not significant. Compared to the strong protection against non-PT SNJ1, CJ7-F cells are susceptible to PT-modified SNJ1, even in the presence of DndCDEA-PbeABCD. Source data are provided as a Source Data file  To further examine the components that are essential for this antiviral activity, we constructed a series of pWHU3808-derived plasmids (pWHU3813~pWHU3816), each expressing DNA PT modification, as well as the individual in-frame deleted genes of the pbeABCD cassette (Supplementary Table 3). Deletion of the individual pbeABCD genes impaired protection against SNJ1, indicating that all four pbe genes are indispensable for mediating antiviral activity (Fig. 4). It is noteworthy that the contributions of four pbe genes against SNJ1 are not equal. To quantify the protection, we measured the efficiency of plating (EOP) of SNJ1 applied to CJ7-F cells expressing different parts of the pbeABCD cassette. In contrast to the absolute necessity of pbeB, pbeC and pbeD, CJ7-F cells expressing dndCDEA-ΔpbeA-pbeBCD still exhibited a low-level of resistance, although less than one order of magnitude, against SNJ1, suggesting that pbeA is partially required for defence (Fig. 4). To assess whether PT modification is sufficient to protect viruses against PbeABCD interference, we propagated SNJ1 in CJ7-F cells expressing only dndCDEA, yielding PT-modified SNJ1 (Supplementary Fig. 5). In sharp contrast to the strong protection observed against the non-PT-modified SNJ1 virus, CJ7-F cells expressing dndCDEA-pbeABCD displayed the same susceptibility to PT-modified SNJ1 as CJ7-F cells lacking dndCDEA-pbeABCD (Fig. 4).  It is, therefore, likely that dndCDEA-pbeABCD encodes R-M activity for which DNA PT modification serves as a recognition tag, allowing discrimination between self and non-self DNA. If the Pbe moiety is capable of independent action, then deletion of PT modification genes would likely be detrimental to archaeal cells because genomic 5ʹ-GATC-3ʹ sites would no longer be protected by PT from the restriction activity of PbeABCD. Surprisingly, it was easy to prepare the plasmids pWHU3809, pWHU3810, pWHU3811 and pWHU3812 harbouring individually in-frame-deleted dndCDEA genes but a complete pbeABCD (Supplementary Table 3). Indeed, these plasmids exerted no notable toxicity towards CJ7-F cells and failed to reduce the ability of SNJ1 virus to cause plaque formation, despite the expression of pbeABCD (Supplementary Fig. 6).  Thus, it is possible that the antiviral activity of PbeABCD depends on DNA PT modification in trans or on DndCEDA proteins. To address this possibility, we attempted to construct a plasmid (pWHU3789) expressing DndCDEAC344S-PbeABCD with a single cysteine replaced by serine in DndA. The catalytic cysteine of DndA (C344), corresponding to C327 in S. lividans DndA, is responsible for the nucleophilic attack on the substrate cysteine37. Thus, although this mutation would abolish DNA PT modification at 5ʹ-GPSATC-3ʹ, the integrity of the DndCDEA assembly would be retained. The immediate observation was that in spite of the deficiency of PT modification, pbeABCD was still transcribed in CJ7-F(dndCDEAC344S, pbeABCD), excluding the possibility that DndA or PT acts as a transcriptional regulator of the pbe operon (Supplementary Fig. 7a, b). However, while the transformation of CJ7-F hosts with the pWHU3789 plasmid occurred at normal frequency, the CJ7-F(pWHU3879) transformant restored the sensitivity to SNJ1 (Supplementary Fig. 7c). This result suggested that PbeABCD exerted antiviral activity depending on the presence of PT modifications rather than protein–protein interactions with DndCDEA. This activity differentiates the PbeABCD-mediated defence mechanism from that of DndFGH because the latter still exerted a bactericidal effect, even in the absence of PT modification.  PbeABCD allows virus adsorption but inhibits DNA replication  To gain further insight into the mechanism of action of the PbeABCD-mediated PT defence system, we examined whether the system provides protection by hindering virus attachment. To this end, we compared the efficiency of SNJ1 adsorption to dndCDEA-pbeABCD-containing and dndCDEA-pbeABCD-lacking CJ7-F cells. The result showed that SNJ1 viruses were able to adsorb to the archaeal cells at the same rates regardless of the presence of the dndCDEA-pbeABCD system (Fig. 5a). This finding suggests that DndCDEA-PbeABCD does not offer protection by interfering with virus attachment.Fig. 5Adsorption and DNA replication of the SNJ1 virus in CJ7-F cells expressing or lacking DndCDEA-PbeABCD. a Adsorption of SNJ1 to dndCDEA-pbeABCD-containing CJ7-F cells (red) is not impaired compared to that observed for CJ7-F cells containing the empty vector pFJ6-H (black). After the infection of logarithmic-stage cultures (OD600 = 0.3) with SNJ1 at an MOI = 1, samples were collected at 60-min intervals, and the extracellular (unabsorbed) viral concentration was measured and compared to the initial viral concentrations. The bars represent the means of three experiments, and the error bars represent the SD of the mean. b Real-time qPCR analysis to determine the replication efficiency of the virus SNJ1 in CJ7-F cells expressing (red) or lacking (black) dndCDEA-pbeABCD. Primers amplifying repA and radA were used to determine the concentration of SNJ1 DNA and CJ7-F chromosomes, respectively. The 2CT(radA) – CT(repA) method was used to determine the relative levels of SNJ1 DNA in CJ7-F hosts. c Southern blot analysis of the SNJ1 genome during the infection cycle. Numbers indicate the time (min) following infection. A probe was designed corresponding to positions 9243–9732 nt in the SNJ1 genome. Source data are provided as a Source Data file  We next monitored the replication efficiency of SNJ1 viral DNA during the time course of the infection using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). The PCR products for repA, which is located within the replication region of SNJ1, and radA, a single-copy gene located on the CJ7-F chromosome, were used to estimate the relative viral DNA concentrations compared to archaeal genome equivalents38. After 5 h of infection, a 2.5-fold increase in the intracellular SNJ1 genome level was observed in CJ7-F (dndCDEA, pbeABCD), whereas a 16.7-fold increase was detected in CJ7-F containing the empty vector (Fig. 5b). These results revealed that SNJ1 DNA can be successfully injected into Natrinema cells but that the subsequent viral genome replication process is significantly inhibited by the DndCDEA-PbeABCD system. This observation, along with the results of the adsorption assays, indicated that the replication inhibition likely results from viral DNA cleavage or degradation.  To examine the integrity of SNJ1 DNA, we performed a Southern blot analysis using total DNA isolated from CJ7-F cells treated with SNJ1 at various time points after infection. With increasing infection time, extensive SNJ1 DNA accumulation was observed in dndCDEA-pbeABCD-lacking but not dndCDEA-pbeABCD-containing CJ7-F cells, indicating that DndCDEA-PbeABCD halts viral infection at an early stage (Fig. 5c). Notably, SNJ1 DNA remained intact with no sign of cleavage or processive degradation, even 6 h after infection of CJ7-F cells expressing the DndCDEA-PbeABCD system (Fig. 5c). Consistent with the real-time qPCR results, the Southern blot analysis showed a marginal increase in SNJ1 DNA with an extended infection time, even in the presence of DndCDEA-PbeABCD. Considering the self/non-self discrimination strategy, one explanation for this result is that once SNJ1 DNA acquires PT modification prior to the action of PbeABCD, it is regarded as self-DNA and can replicate in CJ7-F cells, highlighting an evolutionary arms race between the PbeABCD-mediated defence barrier and parasitic DNA. Collectively, these results suggested that DndCDEA-PbeABCD confers resistance against invading viruses via a mechanism other than the direct cleavage or degradation of viral DNA used in canonical R-M systems.  PT-based PbeABCD systems are widespread in microbial genomes  After discovering this new PT-based defence activity in Archaea, we re-examined pbeABCD-adjacent genes among the 2361 prokaryotic dndCD regions. As the gene products of pbeB and pbeD are too small to be annotated in some genomes, we used the sequences of PbeA and PbeC from H. jeotgali A29 as queries for homology searches. In addition to 26 archaeal genomes, 235 additional pbeAC genes were identified in diverse bacterial genomes. However, the phylogenetic tree did not result in clear clustering of DndCD into distinct groups according to a proximate DndFGH, PbeAC or neither (Fig. 3). Moreover, even strains within the same species can accommodate different types of Dnd defence systems. For example, Enterobacter cloacae e1347 and E. cloacae DS15987 harbour PT-based PbeABCD and DndFGH defence systems, respectively, whereas E. cloacae B2-DHA possesses only a solitary PT modification system lacking the restriction counterparts, which is consistent with the HGT of Dnd systems (Supplementary Data 3).  Considering the functional association, we next examined whether these PT modification components had coevolved and been horizontally transferred together with PbeABCD, similar to what occurred with DndFGH34. Using DndCD and PbeAC of H. jeotgali A29 as references, we calculated the alignment similarity rate between the 261 DndCD-PbeAC pairs and their respective reference Dnd and Pbe proteins using the approach previously described34. The same calculation was applied to the 1132 coexisting DndCD-DndFGH proteins, with DndFGH of S. enterica serovar Cerro 87 used as the reference. In general, the coevolution of the modification and restriction components should lead to a linear relationship between their similarity rates34. The results showed that the correlation coefficient (ρ) between the similarity rates for DndCD and DndFGH was 0.582, which is consistent with our previous report34 and confirms the coevolution of DndCD and DndFGH (Supplementary Fig. 8a). In contrast, a ρ-value of 0.107 between DndCD and PbeAC was observed, suggesting that either the dndCD and pbeAC genes were acquired separately by HGT events or that they evolved at different mutational rates owing to different genetic selection pressures (Supplementary Fig. 8b).  To gain a more global view of this new type of PT-based PbeABCD defence system, we performed homology searches and constructed a phylogenetic tree using all 553 PbeAC proteins detected (Fig. 6). An immediate observation was the occurrence of potential interdomain and intradomain gene transfer events. For instance, instead of clustering with other halophilic Archaea, Halorubrum trapanicum CBA1232 grouped with a large clade of bacterial strains, including those of the genera Lactobacillus, Staphylococcus and Bacillus. Surprisingly, only 42.1% (233) of 553 PbeAC proteins were observed to be accompanied by dndCD within 1 bp–10 kb, raising two possibilities: (1) that the solitary PbeABCD components are not active in host cells because their antiviral activity depends on the presence of PT modification and (2) that PbeABCD has evolved to pair with other DNA modifications, such as methylation, to yield new defensive modules. The latter possibility is supported by the observation that candidate base-modifying proteins are encoded within 10 kb of 155 of 320 solitary PbeAC examples (Supplementary Data 4). Notably, PbeAC and DndFGH were observed to be simultaneously present in the neighbourhood of 25 bacterial dndCD clusters (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Data 3). It would be interesting to explore the interactions between these gene cassettes and their contributions to the host defence against invasive DNA.Fig. 6Phylogenetic analysis of 553 PbeAC proteins. Each archaeal and bacterial group is represented in a distinct colour. Green (128) and blue (155) shading indicate the presence of DndCD for phosphorothioate (PT) modification or MTase for methylation within the vicinity of PbeAC. One-hundred and five PbeAC homologues have DndCD and MTase simultaneously present within the defined neighbourhood (1 bp–10 kb), while 165 PbeAC homologues are solitary, lacking the modification component within the neighbourhood.

This bacterium is essential in the maintenance of a healthy vaginal epithelium (1). L. crispatus is known to produce antimicrobial compounds, including organic acids, hydrogen peroxide, bacteriocins, and biosurfactants (2). It is also able to modulate the secretion of cytokines and chemokines that enhance the immune response of vaginal epithelial cells (3). Adhesion and establishment of L. crispatus on the human vaginal epithelium are prerequisites for its protective role (4). In the first step, L. crispatus autoaggregates, leading to the formation of microcolonies on the vaginal epithelium, which then evolve into biofilms, covering the whole ecological niche and providing protection against pathogens (5).  L. crispatus V4 was isolated from a vaginal swab from a young healthy nonmenopausal woman in 2018. These bacteria were collected under the control of the CRO Bio-EC (Longjumeau, France) in agreement with French and European Union ethics guidelines (ARS Biomedical Research agreement 2012-12-010 and Bioethic agreement DC-2008-542). Bacterial isolates were grown anaerobically onto de Man, Rogosa, and Sharpe (MRS) agar plates overnight at 37°C (ISO, VWR reference 84607.0500). Purified bacterial strains were obtained by single-colony isolation. V4 isolates were cultured and later maintained at −80°C using MRS with 20% glycerol.  In the first step, L. crispatus strain V4 was identified with total proteome analysis using a Bruker Autoflex III matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization–tandem time of flight (MALDI-TOF/TOF) mass spectrometry instrument coupled to the Biotyper software (6). Subsequently, 16S rRNA sequencing was performed, and the BLAST algorithm allowed sequence comparison with other L. crispatus strains reported in the NCBI 16S RefSeq database. Since the 16S rRNA sequence of strain V4 displayed 100% sequence identity with those of L. crispatus strains CO3MRSI1 and AB70 (GenBank accession numbers CP033426 and CP026503, respectively), strain V4 was identified as belonging to the L. crispatus species.  Genomic DNA was extracted from MRS broth L. crispatus V4 culture by treating cells with a lysozyme solution (20 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8.0], 2 mM EDTA, 1.2% Triton X-100, 20 mg/ml lysozyme), followed by treatment with a GeneJET genomic DNA purification kit (catalog number K0721; Thermo Fisher Scientific). Genomic libraries were prepared with the Nextera XT DNA sample preparation kit (Illumina) and sequenced using v3 chemistry and 2 × 250-bp paired ends on an Illumina MiSeq platform following the manufacturer’s instructions (LMSM Évreux, Rouen Normandy University).  Trimmomatic v.0.36 (7) was used to trim the 2,316,108 generated reads. FastQC v.0.11.6 (8) was used to check their quality. Genome assembly was achieved de novo with Unicycler v.0.4.7 (9) with default parameters. Quast v.5.0.0 (10) was used to check the consistency of the obtained assembly (i.e., genome size, number of contigs, N50, and G+C content). The final assembly was annotated using Prokka v.1.13.4 (11).  The assembled genome consisted of 252 contigs (coverage, 553×) with a genome size of 2,091,889 bp and an average G+C content of 37.02%, which was consistent with already published L. crispatus genome sequences. The largest contig size was 102,546 bp, with an N50 value of 18,575 bp. The draft genome harbors 2,177 protein-coding sequences, 65 tRNAs, and 3 rRNA gene clusters. The annotated sequences allowed the identification of putative virulence and antibiotic resistance genes relevant to Lactobacillus spp. (12). Subsequent analyses involving comparative genomics will be undertaken in an upcoming study.  Altogether, the availability of the genomic information from strain V4 will improve our understanding of the genetic diversity within the species and the mechanisms involved in microbiome-vaginal health interactions.  Data availability.  The draft genome sequence of Lactobacillus crispatus V4 has been deposited at DDBJ/ENA/GenBank under the accession number SRLG00000000.

OPT23.""","  1. Introduction  Sponges (Phylum Porifera) interact and co-evolve with microbes belonging to different lineages. Despite the ubiquity of microbes in a wide range of environments, associations between sponge and microbes are not random and often result in sharing of the resources in a particular niche. Moreover, sponge-associated bacteria play a crucial role in sponge biology, metabolism, and ecology [1]. Studies using whole-genome sequencing of microbes isolated from sponges and metagenomic binning approaches have shown the genomic and molecular mechanisms involved in the successful association between the sponges and symbiotic microbes. For instance, genome streamlining [2], evolution of bacterial genome through transposable insertion elements [3], presence of adhesion-related genes, the genes encoding eukaryotic-like protein, effector/virulence factors [4,5,6,7] were reported among several sponge-associated bacteria.  Since the first description of the genus Endozoicomonas (Gammaproteobacteria; Oceanospirillales) isolated from the sea slug Elysia ornate [8], Endozoicomonas has been widely reported to be found in association with different marine invertebrates. For instance, several studies reported the presence of Endozoicomonas in sponges, tunicates, cnidarians, annelids, molluscs, and fishes [9,10,11,12,13,14] across large geographical scales (see the review by [15] for further details). Several studies found the predominance of Endozoicomonas in healthy Mediterranean gorgonians—Paramuricea clavata and coral—Porites astreoides when compared to their diseased counterparts [16,17], suggesting that strains belonging to this genus have been considered to be an integral part of the healthy holobiont.  Though numerous studies based on culture-independent analyses using the 16S rRNA (ribosomal RNA) genes have detected the distribution and abundance of Endozoicomonas, there are very few reports investigating the physiological capabilities and genomic features of these enigmatic bacterial members of the genus Endozoicomonas due to the difficulties in isolation/culturing from the host tissues. So far, only 11 draft genomes of Endozoicomonas isolated from sponges, tunicates, coral, mollusc, bryozoa, and fishes are publicly available. Analysis of the draft genomes obtained from bacterial isolates, single cell genomics, and metagenomic binning approaches suggest that Endozoicomonas genomes are encoded with a higher frequency of repeat sequences indicating various stages of genome erosion, possible mechanisms involved in host-endosymbiont relationship, enrichment of genes responsible for transporter activity, protein secretion, and transposase, and niche-specific changes through the expansion of virulence genes and loss of metabolic functions [14,18,19].  Despite the abovementioned features detected in the genomes of coral- and fish-associated Endozoicomonas, little genomic information is available for sponge-associated Endozoicomonas. In this study we sequenced a high-quality draft genome of Endozoicomonas sp. OPT23 isolated from the intertidal marine sponge Ophlitaspongia papilla and performed a comprehensive comparative genomics analysis with other members (n = 11) of the genus to unravel the genomic signatures of the sponge-associated Endozoicomonas sp.

PMC6955870,2. Materials and Methods,Materials and Methods,PPFD00000000,1,0,0,,Basically this entire section,"  2. Materials and Methods  2.1. Isolation of Endozoicomonas  Endozoicomonas sp. OPT23 was isolated from the intertidal marine sponge O. papilla (Demospongiae) collected from the Atlantic coast of Portugal. Approximately 1 cm3 of sponge tissue was washed to remove the loosely associated microbes and other debris, followed by grinding using sterile seawater. The homogenate was serially diluted and spread plated on DifcoTM Marine Agar 2216(BD Difco, United Kingdom) medium containing amphotericin B (1 mL/100 mL). Single colonies were obtained after repeated streaking. Bacterial colonies were inoculated into 5 mL tube containing DifcoTM Marine Broth 2216 and kept under constant shaking at 28 °C. Genomic DNA was extracted from the bacterial cultures in stationary phase using PureLinkTM Genomic DNA kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol for bacterial DNA isolation.  2.2. Whole-Genome Sequencing (WGS) and Genome Analyses  WGS of Endozoicomonas sp. OPT23 was performed on the Illumina’s HiSeq 2500 Sequencing System using paired-end (PE) read library (2 × 100 nt) with an insert size of ≈350 bp. Prior to assembly, low quality reads (Phred score <30) and adapter sequences were removed using cutadapt v1.12 [20]. The processed reads of >1400-fold coverage (based on a 5 Mb genome size) was assembled using Velvet v1.2.10 [21] with the best possible k-mer coverage value (k = 99) obtained from VelvetK. Assembly was further improved by scaffolding using SSPACE_Standard v3.0 [22] and gap filling by GapFillerv1.10 [23] followed by the genome annotation using PROKKA v1.12 [24]. Curated dataset constituting bacterial protein sequences from the UniProt Knowledgebase, UniProtKB Release 2017_3 was compiled locally for the functional assignment of predicted coding sequences (CDS). The genome completeness and contamination were determined using CheckM v1.0.08 [25]. Circular view of the sequenced genome was rendered using CGview (Available online: http://wishart.biology.ualberta.ca/cgview/download.html) [26].  The genomes of the members of the genus Endozoicomonas (n = 11) isolated from different habitats were retrieved from the NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information) genomes FTP site [27]. Prior to the comparative genomic analyses all genome datasets were re-annotated using PROKKA v1.12 [24] to avoid the incongruence of different annotation schemes.  2.3. Clusters of Orthologous Groups of Proteins  For functional prediction, the protein sequences were queried against locally installed eggNOG database v4.5 [28] using eggnog-mapper tool v1.0.3 (DIAMOND mapping mode and other default settings) [29]. Clusters of orthologous groups (COGs) were retrieved from the eggNOG annotation files using a bash script—eggnog-mapper_COGextraction (Available online: https://github.com/raymondkiu/ eggnog-mapper_COGextraction). A heat map representing the abundance of COG functional class was constructed using heatmap.2 function in gplots package v3.0.1 [30] implemented in R v3.4.4 [31]. Z-test was used to determine the significant differences in proportions of COG categories and considering a p-value of <0.01 as threshold for over and under-representation.  2.4. Phylogenetic Analyses and Average Nucleotide Identity  The Endozoicomonas genome tree was constructed with 622 single-copy orthologous genes identified by OrthoFinder v2.3.1 using default DIAMOND sequence similarity searches [32]. The genes were individually aligned using MUSCLE v3.8.31 [33]. Low quality alignment regions were removed using trimAl v1.4 with ‘automated1′ option [34]. Protein-alignment files were concatenated to a super-alignment (encompassing ≈209,574 sites) using FASconCAT v1.1 [35]. A maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree was constructed using IQ-TREE v1.6.1 [36] (using 1000 bootstrap replicates) under automated model selection option ‘TEST’. Distantly related bacterial species—Marinobacterium aestuarii ST58-10 and Cobetia marina JCM 21022—were used as outgroups.  The whole genome-based relatedness among the members of the genus Endozoicomonas was calculated using the average nucleotide identity (ANI) and in silico DNA-DNA hybridization (DDH) estimates implemented in Pyani [37] and GGDC 2.1 (Genome-to-Genome distance calculator) [38] respectively, with the BLAST algorithm (ANIb). DDH values are estimated with formula 2 due to robustness against the use of incomplete draft genomes. The average nucleotide identity (ANI) values were visualized usingheatmap.2 function in gplots package v3.0.1 [30] implemented in R v3.4.4 [31].  2.5. Homolog Clustering and Calculation of Genome-Specific Genes  Protein level homolog clustering, core- and pan-genome sizes of the genus Endozoicomonas were performed using the two algorithms (BDBH and OrthoMCL) implemented in GET_HOMOLOGUES v3.0, with 75% minimum coverage in BLAST pairwise alignments and E-value set at 10−5 [39]. We selected this consensus approach due to the robustness of the homolog clustering generated by the combination of clustering algorithms. Statistical estimation of the theoretical core- and pan-genome sizes was performed with OrthoMCL predicted gene families by fitting Willenbrock exponential model. Different compartments of the pan-genome (‘soft-core’, ‘shell’, and ‘cloud’) were also further computed using the script ‘parse pangenome matrix.pl’ included in the GET_HOMOLOGUES v3.0 [39].  In this study, we defined genome-specific as those genes detected only in one genome and absent in other genomes analyzed. We employed multiple strategies to compute the genome-specific genes in Endozoicomonas sp. OPT23 as illustrated in Figure S1. (i) Initial method involves the estimation of the genome-specific genes using the script ‘parse pangenome matrix.pl’ included in the GET_HOMOLOGUES v3.0 [39]. (ii) In the second method, predicted protein sequences were subjected to orthologous group inference using OrthoFinder v2.3.1 [40] as mentioned above and determined the genome-specific genes—those genes present in only one species (i.e., in Endozoicomonas sp. OPT23) and were unassigned to a specific orthogroup. (iii) In the third method, only genes shared between methods 1 and 2 were regarded as genome-specific genes (i.e., consensus data) with greater confidence. Consensus data and ‘unique’ genes solely detected by methods 1 and 2 (here after referred to as ‘outliers’) were further searched with BLASTp with the E-value set at 10−5 against in-house preformatted nonredundant (nr) NCBI database nr_v5 (accessed on April, 2019) restricting the search to the sequences in the database that correspond to Endozoicomonas (NCBI:txid305899). Sequences matching the database entries were subsequently removed from the list of genome-specific genes. The ‘outlier’ genes recovered from GET_HOMOLOGOUS were not considered for further analyses due to false positive hits. The final set of genome-specific genes was selected by combining the sequences obtained from consensus approach and manually curated ‘outlier’ genes detected by OrthoFinder.  Genome-specific genes of Endozoicomonas sp. OPT23 were predicted by performing BLASTp with E-value set at 10−5 against the locally formatted set of essential genes retrieved from the database of essential genes (DEG, http://tubic.org/deg_bak/download.php; accessed on April, 2019) [41].  2.6. Prediction of Symbioses Factors and Secretion Systems  The genes coding for eukaryotic-like proteins (ELPs) such as ankyrin repeats (ANKs), tetratricopeptide repeat (TPRs), and Sel1 repeat-containing proteins were searched in the annotation files using the key words ‘repeats’, ‘Ankyrin’, ‘Tetratricopeptide’, and ‘Sel1′. Furthermore, the protein sequences of the Endozoicomonas genomes were scanned against local InterPro’s proteins signature database using InterProScan v5.32-71.0 [42]. The output files were screened for the protein domains using InterPro entries- ANKs (IPR020683 and IPR002110), TPRs (IPR011990, IPR019734, IPR013105, IPR001440, and IPR011717), and Sel1 (IPR006597) as previously reported [7,43]. In order to avoid false prediction due to high similarity of proteins containing TPRs and Sel1 repeat, TPRpred v10.3- a profile-based tool was used to classify TPRs and Sel1 repeats within a protein using E-value cutoffs of 10−3 and 10−2 [44].  Secretion systems in the genome were screened and classified by BLAST search using the whole proteome as a query with BlastKOALA (Available online: https://www.kegg.jp/blastkoala/) tool against the taxonomic group “Bacteria” and “genus_prokaryote” database in KEGG v2.2 [45]. Bacterial genomes were further screened for type VI secretion system gene clusters by using HMM searches implemented in SecReT6 [46]. Type VI and type III secretion system effector proteins (T6Es and T3Es) were predicted using bacterial secreted effector protein database SecretEPDB [47]. Briefly, a total of 175 and 1194 T6 and T3 effector protein sequences were extracted from the SecretEPDB and the homologous protein sequences from the Endozoicomonas sp. OPT23 genomes were recovered using BLASTP search with an E-value cutoff of 10−5. FIMO v5.05 implemented in the MEME suite [48] was used to scan the proteins for the presence of motifs Tle1-4 (GxSxG) and Tle5 (HxKxxxxD).  2.7.

OPT23  The genome assembly and sequencing of Endozoicomonas sp. OPT23 isolated from the intertidal marine sponge, O. papilla retrieved a total of 30 scaffolds (N50 of >0.73 Mbp) and revealed a genome size of 4.9 Mbp with a G+C content of 46.84% (Table 1, Figure 1). The genome was nearly complete (99%) with low level of contamination (<5%), based on CheckM analysis with the Gammaproteobacteria gene marker set. The genome annotation predicted a total of 4304 genes, of which 4175 (97%) were protein-coding. Genetic relatedness estimation using ANI and DDH, and its comparison with previously sequenced genomes suggest that sponge-associated Endozoicomonas sp. OPT23 is a novel species (average ANIb value 75% ± 7.5% and average DDH value of 22% ± 1.03%), which are below the threshold of 95% for ANI and 70% for DDH used to delineate species (Figure 2, Table S1). Approximately 79% of the proteins could be assigned based on COGs using eggNOG database. Comparison of the proteins assigned to COGs among Endozoicomonas strains isolated from different habitats did not show any clear differences in the distribution of the proteins among most of the COG categories (Figure S2). Though Endozoicomonas sp. OPT23 represent the second smallest genome among the members of the genus Endozoicomonas, we detected significant over-representation (Z-test, p < 0.01) of COG categories responsible for ‘energy production and conversion’ (C), in Endozoicomonas sp. OPT23 which are likely to encode specialized strain-specific physiological functions. For instance, further analyses revealed that COG category ‘C’ consisted of coding sequences related to various enzymes such as ATP-synthases, dehydrogenases, and ABC-transporter genes indicating the possible ability towards high nutrient uptake/synthesis, which could be an adaptation mechanism of Endozoicomonas sp. OPT23 to thrive in nutrient poor environment. Interestingly, we observed under-representation of genes in the COG functional category ‘replication, recombination and repair’ (L) in Endozoicomonas sp. OPT23 when compared to other strains except in E. elysicola DSM 22380 (genome size of 4 Mbp). This is mainly ascribed to the presence of a smaller number of transposase genes in Endozoicomonas sp. OPT23. While small bacterial genome sizes may partly explain low number of transposase genes, a previous study detected enrichment of transposase genes among Endozoicomonas species suggesting that these bacterial strains are not undergoing genome streamlining considering the large genome sizes [19].  Evolutionary relationship inference using phylogenetic approach with 622 single-copy orthologous gene sequences suggest clustering of the members of the genus Endozoicomonas isolated from different invertebrate hosts such as sponges (Endozoicomonas sp. OPT23 isolated from O. papilla; E. arenosclerae ab112, E. arenosclerae E-MC227 isolated from Arenosclera brasiliensis; and E. numazuensis DSM 25634 isolated from Haliclona sp.) and ascidian (E. ascidiicola AVMART05 and E. ascidiicola KASP37 isolated from the pharynx of Ascidiella sp.), might possibly suggest a co-diversification event between these hosts and symbiotic Endozoicomonas (Figure 3). However, other Endozoicomonas strains isolated from corals did not cluster together in the phylogenetic tree. The observed trend in which the bacterial species failed to cluster based on the habitat/isolation source might indicate the ability of Endozoicomonas bacteria to colonize and establish a symbiotic relationship with a wide variety of marine invertebrate hosts. A similar trend was previously reported among the members of the genus Pseudovibrio isolated from different hosts—sponges, tunicates, coral, flatworms, and free-living [6]. We hypothesize that inconsistent co-evolution of the symbiont with other invertebrate hosts might be due to the influence of other factors such as mode of transmission (horizontal vs. vertical) which warrants further investigation. Sequence information of more symbiotic Endozoicomonas strains might improve the phylogenetic resolution within the Endozoicomonas genus and to test the co-evolution hypothesis.  3.2. Core- and Pan-Genome of Endozoicomonas  Clustering of 61,797 CDS predicted from the 12 genomes of the genus Endozoicomonas derived a total of 18,704 genes defining the pan-genome. Among these, 656 genes (≈3.5%) were found in all the 12 genomes defining the core-genome (Figure S3A,B). The estimation of the core- and pan-genome sizes using Willenbrock exponential model based on orthoMCL clustering indicated a decrease in core- and an increase in pan-genome sizes. Furthermore, the pan-genome fitting curve has not reached a plateau (Figure S3C), suggesting that the pan-genome of Endozoicomonas is open and sequencing of additional new genomes will likely increase the gene pool size/yield novel genes.  The evolutionary history of an organism could be inferred from the flexible genome composition analyses. Therefore, we further computed the less conserved compartments of the pan-genome structure ‘cloud’ (complement of genes present in two or fewer genomes), ‘shell’ (complement of moderately common genes present in nine genomes), and ‘soft-core’ (complement of genes present in 11 genomes) defining the flexible genome (Figure 4A). Subsets of flexible genome (‘cloud’ and ‘shell’ i.e., genes present in 2–9 genomes) were further used since they have different rates of gene acquisition and deletion [49]. Functional COG assignment revealed that majority of the COG categories were over-represented (Z-test, p < 0.01) in the flexible-genome relative to the core-genome, such as genes involved in ‘energy production and conversion’ (C), ‘amino acid transport and metabolism’ (E), ‘carbohydrate transport and metabolism’ (G), ‘lipid transport and metabolism’ (I), ‘transcription’ (K), ‘replication, recombination and repair’ (L), ‘cell wall/membrane/envelope biogenesis’ (M), ‘cell motility’ (N), ‘inorganic ion transport and metabolism’ (P), ‘secondary metabolism’ (Q), ‘function unknown’ (S), ‘signal transduction mechanisms’ (T), and ‘defense mechanisms’(V) (Figure 4B). This trend indicates that the less conserved flexible genomes might be responsible for the functional diversity of Endozoicomonas species thriving in various habitats.  3.3. Estimation of Endozoicomonas sp. OPT23-Specific Genes  Genome-specific genes were estimated to determine the key genomic features unique to the sponge-associated Endozoicomonas sp. OPT23. Approaches 1 and 2 using GET_HOMOLOGS and OrthoFinder detected 851 and 503 genome-specific genes in Endozoicomonas sp. OPT23 (Table S2), respectively. Observed differences in the predicted number of genome-specific genes were expected due to the differences in the similarity search algorithms used for clustering the homologous genes. The consensus method and further validation by taxonomically restricted BLASTp search against nr databases limited the ‘false positive’ identification of genes as genome-specific genes. For instance, our manual inspection and curation suggests that ≈45% of genes identified by GET_HOMOLOGUES were not genome-specific (data not shown). A final set of 506 genome-specific genes was detected in Endozoicomonas sp. OPT23 (Figure S1, Table S2).  Approximately 73% of the genome-specific genes in Endozoicomonas sp. OPT23 were predicted as hypothetical proteins. The genes encoding for functionally unknown proteins might have an important biological role [50] and hence we performed the annotation of Endozoicomonas sp. OPT23-specific genes using essential gene database. Only 8% of the genome-specific genes have homologs in the essential gene database and categorized to the class carbohydrate transport and metabolism, adaptation/protection, fatty acid and phospholipid metabolism, energy metabolism, and unknown function (Table S3). For instance, we identified two homologs of OsmC (osmotically inducible protein C)-like family proteins (IPR003718) known to be involved in defense against oxidative stress caused by organic hydroperoxide, a byproduct of bacterial aerobic respiration [51]. We speculate that detoxification of hydroperoxide to less toxic compounds might help Endozoicomonas sp. OPT23 to survive and proliferate within the host. Other major features detected in the genome of Endozoicomonas sp. OPT23 are discussed in the following sections.  3.4. Metabolic Specificity of Endozoicomonas sp. OPT23  3.4.1. Lactate Utilization Pathway  Genome-specific and metabolic pathway comparison of the members of the genus Endozoicomonas using subsystem-based analyses implemented in RAST [52] predicted the lactate utilization genes arranged in an operon encoded for a D-lactate dehydrogenase (dldD, E.C 1.1.2.4), three iron-sulfur-containing proteins (lutABC), and a gene coding for FadR transcriptional regulator family (phdR) in the genome of Endozoicomonas sp. OPT23 (Figure 5A). BLASTp similarity search of the individual genes encoded in lactate regulon against the nr database detected orthologs of dldD, lutABC, and FadR (70%–90% sequence identity) in a distantly related species of Oceanospirillales bacterium Hp36 isolated from the Icelandic intertidal marine sponge Halichondria panacea and Parendozoicomonas haliclonae isolated from a sponge of the genus Haliclona (Figure S4). Lactate utilization allows microbes with the ability to use lactate (D- and/or L-lactate), a ubiquitous carbon source in nature. In microorganisms, D- or L-lactate dehydrogenase (genes dldD and lldD) play a key role in the lactate utilizing pathway through oxidation of lactate to pyruvate, which is further incorporated into the central carbon metabolism [53]. While dldD was only detected in the genome of Endozoicomonas sp. OPT23, seven other Endozoicomonas spp. genomes (including two species isolated from sponges) contained genes encoding L-lactate dehydrogenase (lldD, E.C 1.1.2.3), whereas the remaining four strains were devoid of the genes coding for either lldD or dldD. It indicates those lldD/dldD are not common genetic traits among Endozoicomonas spp., genomic characteristics previously reported for the genus Streptococcus [54]. However, the observed syntenic genetic organization of lutABC operon (Figure S4) is due to the conserved nature of lutABC operon among a wide range of bacteria [55]. The role of catabolic operons lutABC (lldEFG) in lactate utilization was studied in several microbes such as Desulfovibrio vulgaris [56], Campylobacter jejuni [57], Bacillus subtilis [55], and Shewanella oneidensis [58]. LutABC operons have been shown to be involved in biofilm formation [55], pathogenesis [59,60,61,62], suggesting the role of bacterial lactate metabolism in adaptation/virulence in different niches. It is likely that the orthologs of lutA, lutB, and lutC of lutABC operon mediate lactate utilization in Endozoicomonas sp. OPT23 and might help the bacterium to thrive within the sponge host.  3.4.2. L-Rhamnose Utilization Pathway  Analyses of the genome-specific genes revealed the presence of the genes organized in a putative operon encoding the L-rhamnose (L-Rha) metabolic pathway in Endozoicomonas sp. OPT23. L-Rha is a deoxy-hexose sugar commonly found as a constituent of pectin/hemicellulose polysaccharides present in plants and as a bacterial cell wall component [63,64]. L-Rha is utilized as a carbon source in many microorganisms [65,66]. A study involving comparative genomics of L-Rha pathway among bacteria of diverse taxonomic groups suggests the variations in the key genes responsible for the enzymes, transporters, and regulators for L-Rha utilization [67]. For instance, our analysis using subsystem-based comparative genomics implemented in RAST [52] detected a canonical L-Rha catabolic pathway in Endozoicomonas sp. OPT23 comprising of genes coding for four enzymes, L-rhamnulose-1-phosphate aldolase (RhaD, EC 4.1.2.19), L-rhamnulokinase (RhaB, EC 2.7.1.5), L-rhamnulose isomerase (RhaA, EC 5.3.1.14), and L-rhamnulose mutarotase (RhaM, EC 4.1.2.19) (Figure 5B). Experimental evidence shows that these enzymes are involved in the degradation of L-Rha to dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) and L-lactaldehyde via a phosphorylated pathway in many bacteria [68,69]. Comparison of L-Rha utilization genes of Endozoicomonas sp. OPT23 with other well studied bacterial lineages [67] revealed a lack of a syntenic organization of the L-Rha operon, suggesting a possible new genetic architecture of L-Rha pathway genes in Endozoicomonas sp. OPT23. L-Rha regulon of OPT23 also encoded an ABC transporter for L-Rha uptake (rhaSGHI), a gene coding for a putative DeoR-type transcriptional regulator (56% sequence similarity to DeoR transcriptional regulator of Agrobacterium tumefaciens) and two genes coding for putative α-L-rhamnosidases (EC 3.2.1.40), which exhibited a sequence similarity (up to 51%) with proteins annotated as glycoside hydrolase (GH) 78 family from Streptomyces cyaneus. Transcriptional regulators belonging to DeoR family have been reported to control the L-Rha regulon in Rhizobium leguminosarum bv. trifolii [70] and in Chloroflexus aurantiacus [67]. Alpha-L-rhamnosidases catalyze the hydrolysis of α-L-rhamnosyl-linkages in L-rhamnosides present in polysaccharides. We speculate that Endozoicomonas sp. OPT23 isolated from a sponge might have the ability to catabolize L-rhamnose and use it as a carbon source.  3.4.3. Pheynylacetic Acid Degradation Pathway  A gene cluster (≈11Kbp) with a total of 12 genes related to the phenylacetic acid (PA) catabolic pathway was exclusively detected in the genome of Endozoicomonas sp. OPT23 (Figure 6). Metabolism of phenylacetic acid (phenylacetate) is a central metabolic route of several aromatic compounds derived from substrates such as phenylalanine, liginin-related phenylpropane units, 2-phenylethylamine, phenylacetaldehyde, or environmental pollutants such as styrene and ethylbenzene, into a common intermediate, phenylacetyl-CoA, which is subsequently fed to the Krebs cycle [71,72]. Genomes of environmentally important aromatic degrading microbes such as Escherichia coli [73], Pseudomonas putida [71], and several members of the genus Roseobacter [74] were reported to harbor PA catabolic gene clusters organized in several contiguous operons consisting up to 17 genes. Although not enough evidence is available to validate the functional roles of the gene products encoded in the PA gene clusters of many microbes, some experimental studies validated the possible functions of the PA degradation pathway genes [72,75,76]. For instance, paaK (phenylacetyl-coenzyme A (PA-CoA) ligase) is responsible for the activation of phenylacetate to phenylacetyl-CoA, the first common intermediate of PA pathway. Five-component oxygenase- paaA, paaB, paaC, paaD, and paaE catalyze the 1,2-epoxidation of PA-CoA. The PA-CoA ring hydroxylation system, comprised of paaG, paaZ, and paaJ, followed by a β-oxidation-like pathway complex by paaH, paaF, and paaJ. The PA gene cluster also encodes for a transcriptional repressor paaX, and a putative regulator protein encoding gene paaY.  Our comparative genomics analysis revealed that the genes of the PA catabolon of the sponge-associated Endozoicomonas sp. OPT23 are organized as a single operon, paaXEDCBAJIGYZK and are syntenic with the PA gene cluster of Paraglaciecola agarilytica NO2 belonging to the order Alteromonadales (Figure S5). We detected a discrepancy in the annotation of paaJ, which was annotated as a homologous gene pcaF coding for β-ketoadipyl-CoA thiolase. Subsequent BLASTp analysis suggest a sequence similarity of pcaF with paaJ which also codes for β-ketoadipyl-CoA thiolase of E. coli (E-value 0.0, percentage identity 71%), a trend/classification previously reported in the pathogenic bacterium Burkholderia cenocepacia [75]. It is intriguing that the PA catabolon pathway gene cluster was not detected in any other members of the genus Endozoicomonas analyzed in this study indicating that Endozoicomonas sp. OPT23 might have the ability to utilize phenylacetate as a carbon source and might contribute towards the virulence for the survival within the sponge hosts. Probable links between bacterial virulence and phenylacetate catabolism have been proposed in Mycobacterium abscessus and B. cenocepacia [75,77]. In addition to the utilization of phenylacetate generated through the degradation of aromatic amino acids in proteins, we argue that Endozoicomonas sp. OPT23 might metabolize phenylacetate released from the breakdown of liginin present in algae suggesting that Endozoicomonas sp. OPT23 could be an opportunistic symbiont of the sponge.  The several physiological traits mentioned above encoded in the genome of Endozoicomonas sp. OPT23 could be validated in future using laboratory experiments.  3.5. Symbioses Factors and Secretion Systems  3.5.1. Symbioses-Related Genes in Endozoicomonas sp. OPT23  The genome of the sponge-associated Endozoicomonas sp. OPT23 was encoded with the genes coding for ELPs like ANKs, TPRs, and Sel1-like domain containing proteins (Table S4). These symbioses-related genes, present in pathogenic and symbiotic microbes, are reported to mediate the intracellular survival and pathogenicity by interfering with eukaryotic protein–protein interactions [78,79]. Abundance of ELPs seems to be a major genomic feature of sponge symbionts [3,4,80]. Our recent study reported that the genome of Shewanella sp. OPT22 and S. spongiae KCTC 22492 isolated from sponges are enriched with genes coding for ANKs when compared to other Shewanella strains inhabiting other niches [7]. The role of ANKs from sponge symbionts in modulating the amoebal phagocytosis was experimentally validated [81]. Furthermore, comparative genomics analyses revealed the presence of all three ELPs in varying proportions (in a range of 1–111ANKs, 23–30 TPRs, and 1–10 Sel1) in the genomes of the members of the genus Endozoicomonas examined here (Figure S6). It is not surprising to observe these genome features due to the fact that the Endozoicomonas species examined in this study either have symbiotic lifestyle such as in sponges, corals, ascidians, mollusks, sea slugs, bryozoa, or pathogenic lifestyle such as in fishes. Intriguingly, we detected an overabundance of ANKs (n = 111) in the genome of E. acroporae Acr14 isolated from a coral (Acropora). Closer inspection of the genome of E. acroporae Acr14 revealed that detected genes are true ANKs and ruled out the possibility of false prediction of repeat regions at the contig boundaries. Overall, it is clear that detected ELPs might play a crucial role in establishing either symbiotic or pathogenic association between Endozoicomonas and various invertebrate hosts.  3.5.2. Role of Secretion Systems in Host-Bacterial Relationship  Bacteria use a variety of dedicated secretion systems (SSs) in order to transport protein cargos across their membrane and cell wall for interacting with the environment to establish a favorable niche. Here, we focused only on some of the secretions systems like T3SSs and T6SSs (i.e., components of the type III and type IV secretion system, respectively) which are the key players in establishing a host-associated lifestyle.  Homologs of the T6SS were clustered in two distinct genomic regions (contigs) of Endozoicomonas sp. OPT23 sequenced in this study. These regions were designated as T6SS-I (26 Kbp) and T6SS-II (21 Kbp) (Figure 7), composed of core components—Tss (type VI secretion system) and PAAR, Tag (type VI secretion system associated) proteins with structural, regulatory or effector functions. Furthermore, the T6SS-I and T6SS-II system of Endozoicomonas sp. OPT23 has 20 and 16 genes in common with the sponge-associated Oceanospirillales bacterium Hp36, representing 14 and 13 core genes of the T6SS-I and T6SS-II cluster, respectively. Further, they share synteny in core T6SS genes (Figure S7). T6SS play an important role in protein secretion across their envelope and injecting the toxic effector proteins by direct contact into other prokaryotes or delivered into the eukaryotic hosts to gain access to the resources and dominate in a specific niche [82,83,84,85]. T6SS have been reported to be involved in host–pathogen interactions, bacterial predation and inter/intraspecific competition, bacterial communication, biofilm formation, and symbioses [86,87]. T6SS detected in the Endozoicomonas sp. OPT23 might be functional due to the presence of all structural components of the T6SS apparatus.  We further screened the genome of the Endozoicomonas sp. OPT23 for the presence of potential type VI effector proteins (T6Es) (Table S5). The most common proteins with effector functions, such as Hcp (haemolysin coregulated proteins), VgrG (valine-glycine repeat protein G), and PAAR (proline-alanine-alanine-arginine) repeat proteins were detected within the T6SS gene clusters. Interestingly, we did not find any ‘orphan’ VgrG or Hcp genes in the sequenced genome of Endozoicomonas sp. OPT23. Besides the structural role, VgrG proteins participate in the disruption of the actin cytoskeleton, T6SS-mediated intracellular competition, and host–microbe interactions [88]. It is known that most of the VgrG proteins involved in effector functions present specific extended C-terminal functional domains. However, with our approach we could not identify the presence of such domains in the proteins of the Endozoicomonas sp. OPT23. Lack of homologous VgrG genes in the genome and absence of effector functional domains in VgrG genes indicates that VgrG genes of Endozoicomonas sp. OPT23 might play a structural role. The genome of Endozoicomonas sp. OPT23 encoded one potential effector protein belonging to type VI lipase effectors (Tle). The Tle proteins are T6SS phospholipase effectors involved in targeting the bacterial cell membrane by hydrolyzing the lipid component [89]. Scanning of Tle protein predicted in the Endozoicomonas sp. OPT23 genome using FIMO revealed the presence of GxSxG motif, further categorizing the Tle protein to Tle1–4 families. We speculate that the Tle effector might help the sponge-associated Endozoicomonas sp. OPT23 to compete with other bacterial communities for survival within the sponge host by targeting the cell wall membrane of prokaryotic competitors. In addition, we detected the homologues of signal peptide-containing RbsB (ribose-binding protein)-like effector protein encoding genes in Endozoicomonas sp. OPT23. RbsB is a periplasmic ribose-binding protein encoded in the loci of ribose transport [90] and involved in the binding of substrates such as ribose or autoinducer 2 (AI-2) signaling molecules [91]. Though the relationship between the RbsB-like proteins and T6SS, and its possible role in symbioses are not clear, RbsB-like proteins have been reported as a T6SS substrate in symbiotic Rhizobium leguminosarum [92]. We speculate that the RbsB-like proteins might play a role in enhancing the fitness of Endozoicomonas sp. OPT23 within the eukaryotic sponge hosts. Further experimental evidence is required to confirm the role of the above mentioned T6Es in symbiosis with sponges.  In addition to T6SS, we identified a T3SS in the genome of Endozoicomonas sp. OPT23 (Figure S8). It was located in different genomic regions as gene clusters encoding highly conserved genes responsible for T3SS apparatus. T3SS is a major genetic determinant of Gram-negative bacteria that facilitate the interaction between bacteria and eukaryotic hosts [93]. Besides secretion system apparatus genes encoding homologues of several effector molecules were also detected in the genome of Endozoicomonas sp. OPT23 (Table S5). For instance, type III effector proteins YopH (Yersinia outer protein), IpgD (inositol phosphate phosphatase), HopI1, HopJ1 (Hrp outer protein), and PipB2 (Pathogenicity island-encoded protein) were reported to act as virulence factors to enhance the proliferation of bacterial cells after attachment with eukaryotic hosts [94], help the bacterial invasion and dissemination [95], and recruitment of kinesin-1 on the Salmonella-containing vacuole (SCV), for maintaining a pathogenic lifestyle [96]. Presence of the genes encoding the secretion systems and the effector proteins in the genome of Endozoicomonas sp. OPT23 suggest the ability of the sponge-associated bacterium to interact with the eukaryotic sponge and live in a symbiotic relationship.

Conclusions  The bacterial members of the recently described genus Endozoicomonas are ubiquitous and frequently associate with diverse marine hosts. Several studies reported the genome sequences of Endozoicomonas strains isolated from various invertebrate hosts, but limited information is available on the genomic features of the sponge-associated Endozoicomonas. In this study, we sequenced the genome of Endozoicomonas sp. OPT23 isolated from the intertidal marine sponge O. papilla to gain further insight into the genomic architecture of the sponge-associated Endozoicomonas sp. OPT23 and the molecular mechanisms involved in establishing a successful association with the marine sponge. Though our genus-wide comparative genomics analyses revealed a general trend of uniformity at a functional level, genome-specific analyses suggest the presence of gene clusters encoding for the lactate, L-rhamnose metabolism, and phenylacetic acid (PA) degradation pathway indicating the probable ability of Endozoicomonas sp. OPT23 to utilize the alternative carbon sources. In addition to the observed metabolic specificity, the genome was encoded for eukaryotic-like proteins, which might favor the bacterium to evade the hosts’ immune response and survive within the host cell. Furthermore, the major secretion system machineries were also detected in Endozoicomonas sp. OPT23 that might facilitate in delivering the virulence molecules Tle/RbsB-like effector protein across the bacterial membrane to the sponge host. Conclusively, the genome sequenced in this study represents an important addition to the less represented recently described genus Endozoicomonas and shed further insight into the sponge–bacteria interactions.

OPT23 isolated from the intertidal marine sponge Ophlitaspongia papilla and performed comprehensive comparative genomics analyses.""","  The most recently described bacterial members of the genus Endozoicomonas have been found in association with a wide variety of marine invertebrates. Despite their ubiquity in the host holobiont, limited information is available on the molecular genomic signatures of the symbiotic association of Endozoicomonas with marine sponges. Here, we generated a draft genome of Endozoicomonas sp. OPT23 isolated from the intertidal marine sponge Ophlitaspongia papilla and performed comprehensive comparative genomics analyses. Genome-specific analysis and metabolic pathway comparison of the members of the genus Endozoicomonas revealed the presence of gene clusters encoding for unique metabolic features, such as the utilization of carbon sources through lactate, L-rhamnose metabolism, and a phenylacetic acid degradation pathway in Endozoicomonas sp. OPT23. Moreover, the genome harbors genes encoding for eukaryotic-like proteins, such as ankyrin repeats, tetratricopeptide repeats, and Sel1 repeats, which likely facilitate sponge-bacterium attachment. The genome also encodes major secretion systems and homologs of effector molecules that seem to enable the sponge-associated bacterium to interact with the sponge and deliver the virulence factors for successful colonization. In conclusion, the genome analysis of Endozoicomonas sp. OPT23 revealed the presence of adaptive genomic signatures that might favor their symbiotic lifestyle within the sponge host.  ",FALSE,FALSE,

PMC7414432,Abstract,Abstract,NC_034156,0,0,0,,,"  The genus Alphavirus harbours mostly insect-transmitted viruses that cause severe disease in humans, livestock and wildlife. Thus far, only three alphaviruses with a host range restricted to insects have been found in mosquitoes from the Old World, namely Eilat virus (EILV), Taï Forest alphavirus (TALV) and Mwinilunga alphavirus (MWAV). In this study, we found a novel alphavirus in one Culex declarator mosquito sampled in Panama. The virus was isolated in C6/36 mosquito cells, and full genome sequencing revealed an 11 468 nt long genome with maximum pairwise nucleotide identity of 62.7 % to Sindbis virus. Phylogenetic analyses placed the virus as a solitary deep rooting lineage in a basal relationship to the Western equine encephalitis antigenic complex and to the clade comprising EILV, TALV and MWAV, indicating the detection of a novel alphavirus, tentatively named Agua Salud alphavirus (ASALV). No growth of ASALV was detected in vertebrate cell lines, including cell lines derived from ectothermic animals, and replication of ASALV was strongly impaired above 31 °C, suggesting that ASALV represents the first insect-restricted alphavirus of the New World.

ASALV differs from arboviruses in the WEE complex by its sensitivity to temperatures above 31 °C and the consequential lack of a mammalian host. The other insect-restricted alphaviruses were detected in Culex pipiens, Culex quinquefasciatus, Culex decens and Anopheles coustani mosquitoes, while ASALV was found in Culex declarator mosquitoes [2, 3, 11, 28]. Based on these genetic and biological characteristics, ASALV probably represents a new alphavirus species and represents the first insect-restricted alphavirus detected in the New World.  Phylogenetic analyses suggest a marine origin of the genus Alphavirus [10]. The basal salmonid alphaviruses have no known insect vector and are temperature-sensitive above 15 °C in cell lines derived from fish and mosquitoes [29, 30]. EEEV can infect snakes [31–33] and WEEV and related viruses can replicate in reptilian and fish cells, supporting the theory of a marine origin of alphaviruses [27]. All insect-restricted alphaviruses known to date have been found in Culex mosquitoes [2, 3, 28], which are known to feed on ectothermic hosts [34, 35]. Because ASALV was isolated from a Culex declarator mosquito and was temperature-sensitive, we infected cell lines derived from ectothermic host (amphibians, reptiles and fish) at low temperatures, but in contrast to the related viruses from the WEE complex no virus replication was observed, further confirming that ASALV is an insect-specific virus.  The presence of RSEs in the 3′-UTR of insect-associated alphaviruses and their absence in aquatic alphaviruses may help to understand the evolutionary transition from aquatic to terrestrial alphaviruses. It has been shown that the RSEs in the 3′-UTR of SINV are important for the efficient translation of the viral genome in insect cells [6]. In contrast to the insect-restricted alphaviruses, which contain RSEs, the salmonid alphavirus Sleeping Disease Virus has a short 3′-UTR without RSEs [9] and insertion of SINV RSEs in the 3′-UTR of Sleeping Disease Virus improves the infection of insect cells [6]. Hence, the acquisition of RSEs in the 3′-UTR of aquatic alphaviruses might have enabled the infection and acquisition of insects as hosts [36]. Such a putative host range expansion could have occurred through recombination events with related invertebrate viruses such as negeviruses [13]. Negeviruses are widely distributed in mosquito and sandfly populations from Africa, the Americas, Europe and Asia [25]. They belong to the alphavirus supergroup and fall into two diverse groups in phylogenetic analyses, named Nelorpivirus and Sandewavirus, in relationship to segmented plant viruses [24, 25, 37]. Interestingly, the ASALV 3′-UTR contains RSEs, which are also found in the 3′-UTR of the unclassified negevirus Cordoba virus. ASALV and other alphaviruses further contain an SRS motif, which is also present in the 3′-UTRs of negeviruses within the Nelorpivirus clade. The presence of similar sequence elements in alpha- and negeviruses may represent putative ancient sites of recombination. RNA recombination occurs in alphaviruses and the first known recombination event was between an EEEV-like and a SINV-like virus from which WEEV, Highlands J virus and Fort Morgan virus have emerged [27, 38]. In addition, alphaviruses are related to plant viruses of the families Virga  viridae, Bromo  viridae and Closteroviridae and it is believed that multiple recombination events took place during the evolution of the alphavirus supergroup [37, 39]. The transfer of functional UTR elements through recombination between different viral families was also previously described for 3′-UTR cap-independent translation enhancers in plant viruses [40].  For the infection of mammalian hosts and the evolution of a dual-host tropism, additional changes, such as adaptation to higher temperatures and immune evasion, were necessary. Adaptions of alphaviruses to higher temperatures seem to have occurred in the past and the temperature sensitivity of alphaviruses is in agreement with the phylogenetic placement. The fish-infecting alphaviruses can replicate at temperatures up to 15 °C [29] whereas the insect-infecting alphaviruses can replicate at temperatures up to 30 °C. ASALV and the other insect-restricted alphaviruses could be intermediates from a transition of alphaviruses with solely aquatic hosts to terrestrial alphaviruses with a dual-host cycle infecting insects and vertebrates.  Further support for this hypothesis and multiple independent adaptation events to vertebrate hosts are peculiarities of AURAV. AURAV is phylogenetically placed apical to the insect-restricted viruses and basal to the arboviruses of the WEE complex. AURAV was isolated from Culex sp. and Aedes serratus mosquitoes captured in Brazil and Argentina and has no known vertebrate host [41, 42]. Most vertebrate-adapted alphavirus genomes contain an RNA structure, namely downstream loop (DLP), which allows eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2-independent translation initiation if dsRNA-activated protein kinase R (PKR) activation occurs in infected vertebrate cells. In contrast, AURAV has a suboptimal DLP structure and is only able to replicate in BHK cells, which express low levels of PKR, or in PKR knockout cells, indicating an incomplete adaptation to vertebrate hosts [43]. Interestingly, the observed structural differences in the DLP probably derived from independent introduction events in the clades of SINV, Semliki Forest virus and EEEV [43].  Viruses may be targeted by two small RNA pathways in mosquitoes, the siRNA/RNAi pathway and the piRNA pathway [44], of which the former is considered a major antiviral defence response. We find that ASALV viral RNA is processed into siRNAs, but not piRNAs. This is unexpected as viral piRNAs are produced upon infection of mosquito cells with other alphaviruses such as Chikungunya, Sindbis and Semliki Forest virus [21, 45–47]. The majority of viral piRNAs in these infections derive from the viral positive strand in the region encoding the subgenomic RNA, suggesting that this RNA is a major substrate for viral piRNA biogenesis. While ASALV also produces a subgenomic RNA, our data indicate that this is not sufficient to trigger efficient viral piRNA production. Together, these results suggest that double stranded replication intermediates from ASALV are subject to Dicer-2 cleavage, efficiently producing viral siRNAs that can trigger an RNAi response.  Thus far, only insect-specific alphaviruses in basal phylogenetic relationship to the WEE complex have been detected, but additional insect-specific alphaviruses related to other serological complexes might be discovered in the future. ASALV and additional alphavirus isolates with restricted host range might help to understand the evolution of the dual-host tropism in the genus Alphavirus.  ",FALSE,TRUE,

PMC7414432,Introduction,Introduction,NC_034156,0,0,0,,,"  Introduction  The genus Alphavirus (family Togaviridae) includes 31 approved virus species [1] and two putative additional species that have been recently described and await ratification by the International Committee on Virus Taxonomy (ICTV) [2, 3]. Alphaviruses are mostly mosquito-borne viruses that can cause severe diseases in humans, livestock and wildlife. Their host range includes mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians and fish. Old World alphaviruses, such as chikungunya virus (CHIKV), can cause acute febrile illness with arthralgia, while New World alphaviruses, such as Western equine encephalitis virus (WEEV), are neuroinvasive and can cause encephalitis [4, 5]. The currently approved alphaviruses form 11 serological complexes that group accordingly in phylogenetic analyses [1].  The alphavirus genome consists of single-stranded, positive-sense RNA encoding two ORFs for non-structural proteins (NSPs) and structural proteins (SPs), respectively [1]. The ORFs are framed by untranslated regions (UTRs). The 3′-UTR of most alphaviruses contains repeated sequence elements (RSEs) that seem to be important for the successful infection of insect vectors [6–8]. An exception is the group of salmonid alphaviruses that have short 3′-UTRs without RSEs [9]. These viruses have no known insect vector and were placed in a basal phylogenetic position to all known alphaviruses, suggesting an aquatic origin of the genus [10].  In addition to the vertebrate-infecting groups of mosquito-borne alphaviruses and aquatic alphaviruses, another group of alphaviruses, which is restricted in its host range to mosquitoes, was discovered in recent years. The group contains three insect-restricted alphaviruses that have been detected in mosquitoes from the Old World [2, 3, 11]. These viruses, Eilat virus (EILV), Taï Forest alphavirus (TALV) and Mwinilunga alphavirus (MWAV), form a monophyletic sister clade to the WEE complex [3, 11]. TALV and MWAV could not be isolated in cell culture. However, EILV was isolated in cell culture from infected mosquitoes but an insect-restricted virus (Negev virus) of the unclassified group of negeviruses was also present in the same cell culture sample [11]. A reverse genetic system of EILV was established to separate EILV from the negevirus and was used for studies on host range restriction [11].  In contrast to insect-restricted viruses of other families, insect-restricted alphaviruses are rarely detected in mosquitoes and show very low prevalence rates in mosquito populations [2, 12]. In addition, screenings of diverse invertebrates for RNA viruses revealed no novel alphaviruses [13, 14]. The objective of this study was to assess the diversity of alphaviruses in mosquitoes of the New World using mosquitoes collected in forested areas of the Panama Canal Zone, Panama.  ",FALSE,TRUE,

Details on mosquito sampling and identification will be described in another publication.  RT-PCR screening  Mosquitoes were homogenized individually in 500 µl Leibovitz’s L-15 medium (Gibco – Thermo Fisher Scientific) using ceramic beads and a SpeedMill Plus (Analytik Jena). Stainless steel beads were used for the homogenization of Culex mosquitoes. In total, 1414 pools containing five to 11 mosquitoes were generated according to species and sampling location by combining 100 µl cleared supernatant of individual mosquito homogenates. RNA was extracted from pooled supernatants using the MagNA Pure 96 Instrument with the MagNA Pure 96 DNA and Viral NA Small Volume Kit (Roche Diagnostics). SuperScript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen – Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used for cDNA synthesis according to the manufacturer’s instructions. All pools were screened for alphaviruses with a generic RT-PCR as previously described [2]. For PCR-positive pools, RNA was extracted from homogenates of individual mosquitoes using the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen). cDNA was synthesized and samples were tested for viruses by PCR as described above.  Virus isolation and plaque purification  The homogenate of mosquito pool MP416 was used for primary virus isolation in C6/36 and Vero cells [15]. Briefly, the supernatant of the mosquito suspension was filtrated through a 0.45 µm filter and cells seeded in 24-well plates were infected with 100 µl (F) and 10 µl (F10) of the suspension. Seven days post-infection (dpi) 100 µl of the supernatant was passaged on fresh cells. This procedure was repeated four times. Cells were observed daily for signs of cytopathic effects (CPEs). A virus stock was generated from the second passage of MP416-F10 and harvested 6 dpi. Agua Salud alphavirus (ASALV) was plaque-purified from this stock using a plaque assay in C6/36 cells as described previously [16]. 1 ml of the serially diluted virus stock was used to infect the cells and after 1 h the inoculum was replaced by the overlay. Plaques were picked 7 dpi using a pipette tip, transferred to fresh C6/36 cells and incubated for 3 days. This was repeated twice with a reduction of the plaque assay incubation time to 6 days. A plaque-purified stock was generated (hereafter named ASALV-PP) and the virus titre was determined by a plaque assay as described above. Deep sequencing was performed to verify the purity of the ASALV-PP stock.  Cell lines  The two Aedes albopictus cell lines C6/36 (ECACC 89051705) and U4.4 (obtained from the Radboud Institute for Molecular Life Sciences, Nijmegen, The Netherlands) were used for growth kinetics. C6/36 cells were cultivated in L-15 medium with 5 % FCS (Biochrom – Merck KGaA) and 1 % l-glutamine (Gibco – Thermo Fisher Scientific). U4.4 cells were cultivated in L-15 medium with 20 % FCS, 2 % Tryptose Phosphate Broth (Gibco – Thermo Fisher Scientific), 1 % Non-Essential Amino Acids (NEAA) (Gibco – Thermo Fisher Scientific) and 1 % l-glutamine. Both cell lines were incubated at 28 °C without CO2. The three fish cell lines BF-2 (Lepomis macrochirus – CCLV-RIE 290), CHSE-214 (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha – CCLV-RIE 1104) and FHM (Pimephales promelas – CCLV-RIE 57) were obtained from the Friedrich-Loeffler-Institute (Greifswald, Germany). BF-2 cells were cultivated in minimal essential medium (MEM) with Hanks’ salt (Gibco – Thermo Fisher Scientific) with 10 % FCS and 850 mg NaHCO3 l−1 (Gibco – Thermo Fisher Scientific). CHSE-214 cells were cultivated in MEM with Earle’s salt (Gibco – Thermo Fisher Scientific) with 10 % FCS, 1 % NEAA and 120 mg sodium pyruvate l−1 (Sigma-Aldrich – Merck KGaA). FHM cells were cultivated in MEM with Hanks’ salt with 10 % FCS and 850 mg NaHCO3 l−1 . The snake cell line VH2 (Daboia russelii – GCC 90102539) was cultivated in MEM with Hanks’ salt with 10 % heat-inactivated FCS, 1 % l-glutamine and 1 % NEAA. The frog cell line ICR-2A (Rana pipiens – HPACC 89072615) was cultivated in L-15 medium with 40 % distilled water, 10 % FCS and 1 % l-glutamine. VH2 and FHM cells were incubated at 28 °C with and without CO2, respectively. The ICR-2A, BF-2 and CHSE-214 lines were incubated at room temperature.  Growth kinetics and infection of vertebrate cell lines  All infections were performed with ASALV-PP in duplicate. To measure the amount of viral genome copies, RNA was extracted from cell culture supernatant using the NucleoSpin RNA Virus kit (Macherey-Nagel), cDNA was synthesized as described above and a specific quantitative RT-PCR was established (MP416-ASALV-TM-F, 5′-CCGTACTCGAAACAGACATTGC-3′; MP416-ASALV-TM-R, 5′-TCGTCAACGCCTAGATCCTCTA-3′; MP416-ASALV-TM, 5′−6-FAM/ACAAATCCC/ZEN/AGGACGACTCG/Iowa Black FQ-3′). One day before infection of C6/36 and U4.4 cells, 2.5×105 cells per well were seeded in 24-well plates. Cells were infected at an m.o.i. of 0.1 and 0.01 in 300 µl medium without additives and washed three times with 1 ml PBS and once with 1 ml medium with additives after 1 h of incubation at 28 °C. 1 ml medium with additives was added and 50 µl (C6/36) or 75 µl (U4.4) of supernatant was taken for RNA extraction. Samples were taken every 6 h for 48 h and after 72 h (C6/36) or every 24 h for 3 days (U4.4). C6/36 cells were incubated at 28–32 °C to assess the temperature sensitivity of ASALV as described previously [17]. Vertebrate cell lines were inoculated with ASALV to analyse the in vitro host range. BF-2, CHSE-214, FHM, ICR-2A and VH2 cells were seeded 1 day before infection (1×105 per 24-well) and infected at an m.o.i. of 1 in 300 µl medium without additives. After 1 h of incubation, 700 µl medium with additives was added and 75 µl supernatant was taken for RNA extraction. The supernatant was passaged weekly for four passages and an aliquot of the supernatant was taken before passaging.  Genome sequencing  For deep sequencing, RNA from infectious cell culture supernatants of the second passage of MP416-F10 (ASALV strain PA-2013-MP416) and of the plaque-purified stock ASALV-PP were used. cDNA synthesis and sequencing with the MiSeq desktop sequencer (Illumina) was performed as described previously [2]. Genome ends of ASALV strain PA-2013-MP416 were amplified using the 3′ and 5′ RACE System for Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends (ThermoFisher Scientific) and PCR products were sequenced by Sanger sequencing (Microsynth).  Genomic and phylogenetic analyses  All sequences were assembled and analysed in Geneious R9.1.8 [18]. ASALV genome analyses were performed based on the full genome sequence of ASALV strain PA-2013-MP416. For phylogenetic analyses, nucleotide sequences of the structural protein ORF encoding the E2, 6K and E1 proteins and the non-structural protein ORF (nsP1-nsP4) excluding parts of nsP3 of all established alphavirus species, TALV, MWAV and ASALV, were aligned by a MAFFT-E v7.308 [19] translational alignment in Geneious. An optimized maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree with the GTR substitution model and 1000 bootstrap replicates was calculated using PhyML as implemented in Geneious [20]. The trees were rooted to the midpoint.  Small RNA library preparation and analysis  U4.4 cells were cultured as described previously [21], and were seeded at a density of 2×106 cells per well in six-well plates and infected the next day with ASALV at an m.o.i. of 0.1. The cells were harvested for total RNA isolation at 72 hpi in RNA-Solv reagent (Omega Biotek R630-02). Small RNA libraries were prepared from 1 µg of total RNA using the NEBNext Multiplex Small RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina (NEB E7560S). The amplified libraries were size selected on a 6 % acrylamide/1× TBE gel and quantified using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer System, and pooled libraries were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq4000 machine by Plateforme GenomEast. Small RNA reads were mapped to the ASALV genome (ASALV-PP) using Bowtie (Galaxy Tool Version 1.1.2 [22]) allowing for one mismatch and the genome distribution was obtained by plotting the 5′ end position of the ASALV mapping reads on the viral genome. Reads were normalized to total library size (reads per million).  Accession numbers  The complete genome sequence of ASALV strain PA-2013-MP416 was assigned GenBank accession number MK959114. The complete genome sequence of ASALV-PP was assigned GenBank accession number MK959115. The small RNA sequencing data were deposited at the Sequence Reads Archive with accession number PRJNA559096.

The 3′-UTR of Cordoba virus further contained four copies of the SRS motif present in alphaviruses (Fig. 2b)""","  Results  Detection of a novel alphavirus  To analyse the genetic diversity of alphaviruses in mosquitoes from the New World, we tested 13 806 mosquitoes originating from sylvatic habitats in Panama. Samples were combined into 1414 pools and tested with a generic RT-PCR [2]. One pool (MP416), consisting of 10 Culex declarator mosquitoes captured in a forest fragment surrounded by agriculture, contained a sequence showing 75 % nucleotide identity to TALV, suggesting the detection of a novel alphavirus. The virus was tentatively named Agua Salud alphavirus (ASALV). Testing of the individual mosquitoes from pool MP416 revealed only one ASALV-positive mosquito (M9506). This corresponds to a prevalence of 0.00724 %.  Virus isolation and purification  ASALV was isolated in C6/36 cells by two approaches, either using undiluted mosquito homogenate (MP416-F) or a 1 : 10 dilution (MP416-F10). MP416-F induced a strong CPE after the second cell culture passage with dead and aggregated cells 3 dpi (Fig. 1a  ﻿﻿﻿ right panel﻿﻿﻿). MP416-F10 induced a weaker CPE with reduced cell growth and rounded or stretched cells 3 dpi (Fig. 1a middle panel﻿). Both supernatants were positive for ASALV by RT-PCR. Due to the observed CPE differences between the two isolates, the supernatants were further tested for other viruses. A virus with 99 % nucleotide identity to the negevirus Wallerfield virus (WALV) [23] was detected in the supernatant of MP416-F but not in MP416-F10. Negeviruses are fast growing in cell culture and induce strong CPEs similar to that observed for MP416-F [24]. ASALV was thus plaque-purified from the third passage of MP416-F10 (hereafter named ASALV-PP). ASALV-PP induced distinct, medium-sized plaques in C6/36 cells 6 dpi (Fig. 1b) and deep sequencing of infectious cell culture supernatant confirmed a pure ASALV stock with no other viruses present. ASALV-PP showed 99.97 % pairwise nucleotide identity to the wild-type strain, corresponding to four single nucleotide exchanges. Three of these exchanges led to amino acid changes, two in nsP2 (I597V and A627T) and one in nsP4 (V295I).  Fig. 1.  Virus isolation. (a) Photographs of mock-infected C6/36 cells and cells infected either with filtrated homogenate (MP416-F) or filtrated and 1 : 10 diluted homogenate (MP416-F10) 3 dpi. (b) Plaque morphology of the plaque-purified strain ASALV-PP in C6/36 cells 6 dpi.  ASALV genome analysis  The complete genome of ASALV consisted of 11 468 nt and showed a typical alphavirus genome organization including conserved sequence elements (CSEs) and cleavage sites (Fig. 2a). ASALV showed a maximal pairwise nucleotide identity of 62.7 % to Sindbis virus (SINV). Pairwise comparison of the NSP- and SP-ORFs yielded 66.5 and 52.9 % maximal amino acid identity to Whataroa virus (WHATV), respectively, a mosquito-borne alphavirus from New Zealand. Pairwise protein identities between ASALV and other alphaviruses are shown in Supplementary file 1 (available in the online version of this article). According to the species demarcation criteria for alphaviruses of the ICTV, alphaviruses belonging to different species show in most cases more than 10 % divergence in their amino acid sequences of the complete coding regions, although species demarcation is based on a combination of genetic and biological characteristics such as differences in virulence, host or mosquito vector usage [1]. ASALV differed by at least 47.1 % in the SP-ORF and by at least 33.5 % in the NSP-ORF at the amino acid level from other alphaviruses, was detected in a different vector species than other alphaviruses and is unlikely to infect mammalian hosts (see below). ASALV is thus proposed to define a novel alphavirus species.  Fig. 2.  Genome analyses of ASALV. (a) Schematic illustration of the ASALV genome including motifs and CSEs. The ORFs are indicated in blue (NSP) and orange (SP). Amino acid length of the mature peptides and UTR nucleotide length are displayed. (b) MAFFT-E alignment of the SRS motif of ASALV, representative alphaviruses and Cordoba virus (NC_034156 – unclassified negevirus [25]). For GenBank accession numbers of the alphaviruses see Fig. 3. (c) MAFFT-E alignment of the RSE of ASALV and Cordoba virus.  The 3′-UTR of ASALV was 339 nt long and contained one copy of the short repeated sequence (SRS) motif previously described in the 3′-UTRs of TALV and other alphaviruses without U-rich regions [2]. The copy of the SRS motif was 100 % identical to the first copy of Getah virus, a mosquito-borne alphavirus that is widespread from Eurasia to Australia (Fig. 2b). In addition, three copies of a novel RSE were detected in the 3′-UTR of ASALV. The novel RSE was not found in other alphaviruses but two copies of it were detected in the putative 3′-UTR of Cordoba virus, an unclassified negevirus [25]. The Cordoba virus RSE copies showed 74–89 % identity to the three copies of ASALV (Fig. 2c). The 3′-UTR of Cordoba virus further contained four copies of the SRS motif present in alphaviruses (Fig. 2b). Similar SRS motifs were also detected in the 3′-UTRs of other negeviruses within the Nelorpivirus group and Santana virus.  Phylogenetic analysis  Maximum-likelihood phylogenetic analyses based on the structural polyprotein E2-6K-E1 ORF placed ASALV on a long solitary branch in basal position to the WEE complex and to the clade comprising the insect-restricted viruses TALV, MWAV and EILV from the Old World (Africa and Asia) (Fig. 3). ASALV was in apical position to Trocara virus (TROV), which was isolated from mosquitoes collected in the Amazon Basin in Brazil and Peru, and can infect vertebrate cells, mice and hamsters [26]. ASALV was placed at the same position in phylogenetic analyses based on the non-structural polyprotein ORF (nsP1-nsP4) where ASALV remained basal to SINV, WHATV and Aura virus (AURAV) and to the clade of the insect-restricted viruses, while WEEV and the related recombinant viruses of the WEE complex clustered with Eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV) (Supplementary file 2). The observed phylogenetic distance between ASALV and established virus species is in agreement with the genetic distance to other alphaviruses and supports the suggestion that ASALV might define a new alphavirus species.  Fig. 3.  Phylogenetic relationship of ASALV. The phylogenetic tree was inferred based on a MAFFT-E translational alignment of the nucleotide sequences of the region of the structural protein ORF encoding the E2, 6K and E1 protein of all established alphavirus species, TALV, MWAV and ASALV strain PA-2013-MP416. An optimized maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree with the GTR substitution model and 1000 bootstrap replicates was calculated using PhyML. The tree was rooted to the midpoint. GenBank accession numbers are shown next to the virus names. EEE, eastern equine encephalitis; VEE, Venezuelan equine encephalitis; WEE, western equine encephalitis; SF, Semliki Forest.  In vitro host range of ASALV  As ASALV branched between the insect-specific and vertebrate-pathogenic alphaviruses, we next analysed the in vitro host range. ASALV replicated to high titres 24–48 hpi in the mosquito cells C6/36 (Fig. 4a) and U4.4 (Fig. 4b). Replication kinetics at different temperatures in C6/36 cells revealed a temperature-sensitivity of ASALV with delayed growth at 31 °C and complete block at 32 °C (Fig. 4c). This suggests that ASALV is not able to infect vertebrates with body temperatures over 32 °C, such as mammals and birds. We further tested the ability of ASALV to infect cell lines derived from ectothermic vertebrates (e.g. frogs, snakes and fish) with incubation temperatures between 20 and 30 °C. No replication was detected in the tested vertebrate cells VH2, ICR-2A, FHM, CHSE or BF-2 (Fig. 4d). This was in contrast to previous observations for the vertebrate-infecting alphaviruses WEEV, Fort Morgan virus and Highlands J virus, which could replicate in VH2 and FHM cells [27]. Infection of Vero cells incubated at 30 °C was likewise negative.  Fig. 4.  In vitro host range. (a) Growth kinetics of ASALV-PP in C6/36 cells. (b) Growth of ASALV-PP in U4.4 cells.

Each data point represents the mean of duplicates with standard deviation.  Viral small RNA profiles in mosquito cells  To determine if ASALV is targeted by RNAi in mosquito cells, we analysed small RNAs in infected U4.4 cells. As expected, total small RNA reads showed prominent populations of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) (21 nt), micro RNAs (miRNAs) (~22 nt) and piRNAs (25–30 nt) (Fig. 5a). ASALV derived reads were almost exclusively 21 nt in length, indicative of Dicer-2-dependent biogenesis, and mapped to both the positive and the negative strand in approximately equal numbers (Fig. 5b). These viral siRNAs are distributed across the entire genome, with a slightly higher coverage in the first quarter of the viral genome (Fig. 5c). In contrast to the viral siRNAs, hardly any viral small RNAs in the size range of 25–30 nt were produced, indicating that ASALV is not efficiently processed into piRNAs (Fig. 5b).  Fig. 5.

PMC8415480,Abstract,Abstract,AM933173,0,0,0,,,"  Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Gallinarum (SG) is a common pathogen in chickens, and causes an acute systemic disease that leads to high mortality. The live attenuated vaccine 9R is able to successfully protect chickens older than six weeks by activating a robust cell-mediated immune response, but its safety and efficacy in young chickens remains controversial. An inactivated SG vaccine is being used as an alternative, but because of its low cellular immune response, it cannot be used as a replacement for live attenuated 9R vaccine. In this study, we employed gamma irradiation instead of formalin as an inactivation method to increase the efficacy of the inactivated SG vaccine. Humoral, cellular, and protective immune responses were compared in both mouse and chicken models. The radiation-inactivated SG vaccine (r-SG) induced production of significantly higher levels of IgG2b and IgG3 antibodies than the formalin-inactivated vaccine (f-SG), and provided a homogeneous functional antibody response against group D, but not group B Salmonella. Moreover, we found that r-SG vaccination could provide a higher protective immune response than f-SG by inducing higher Th17 activation. These results indicate that r-SG can provide a protective immune response similar to the live attenuated 9R vaccine by activating a higher humoral immunity and a lower, but still protective, cellular immune response. Therefore, we expect that the radiation inactivation method might substitute for the 9R vaccine with little or no side effects in chickens younger than six weeks.  ",FALSE,FALSE,

PMC8415480,Discussion,Results and Discussion,AM933173,0,0,0,,,"  Discussion  Inactivated vaccines have been the most widely used type of vaccine since the 1920s, but due to the recent emergence of new strains and subtypes, it is becoming difficult to sufficiently prevent infectious diseases with inactivated vaccines (37). Instead, live vaccines are being used as alternatives, but their use is extremely limited because of their difficulty in development and high virulence to immunocompromised humans and animals (38). For example, the SG 9R live vaccine against SG has recently been reported as an unpredictable invasive infection (8). Thus, there is an urgent need to develop safe new SG vaccines. In this study, we found that a r-SG vaccine could provide a higher homogeneous protective response against group D Salmonella by activating early humoral responses (IgG2b and IgG3) and Th1/Th17 cell-mediated immunity than f-SG.  Multiple studies have shown that radiation-inactivated vaccines provide better efficacy than conventional vaccines (13). Furuya et al. reported that influenza vaccines inactivated with gamma radiation significantly enhanced the activity of cytotoxic T cells, which could provide heterosubtypic protection against various influenza subtypes, including the H5N1 avian influenza virus (39). Although ultraviolet radiation was used to inactivate Listeria in a study by Brockstedt et al., they reported that this could induce a potent CD8+ T cell response to increase cellular immunity (40). However, our study found that the r-SG vaccine activates SG-specific Th1/Th17 cells more than cytotoxic T cells, possibly providing high protective immunity. In fact, we recently demonstrated that radiation-inactivated pneumococcal vaccines provide protection via Th17-mediated mucosal immune responses (41). Thus, radiation inactivation methods generally provide stronger protective immune responses, but the type of response induced may differ depending on the type of pathogen. As the molecular mechanism underlying the high immune response of radiation-inactivated vaccines is not yet clear, the key determinants leading to the activation of cytotoxic T cells or Th17 cells should also be studied.  Formaldehyde is an electrophilic aldehyde that induces chemical crosslinking of the N-terminal nucleophilic amino group of cysteine, histidine, lysine, tryptophan, and arginine (42). It is well known that the use of formaldehyde, in the form of the aqueous solution formalin, for vaccine production can cause a variety of immunological issues because it can alter the structure of antigenic epitopes (43, 44) and diminish the production of pathogen-specific and functional antibodies. We reported that formalin inactivation could decrease the humoral immune response by impairing the activity of influenza surface antigens hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) (45). In this study, we also showed that formalin treatment of SG (f-SG) dramatically increased the carbonylation of SG proteins compared to untreated cells or r-SG. Second, formalin is known to increase unpredictable immune responses, such as antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) (46). For example, a formalin-inactivated respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine in naïve infants failed to prevent disease, and 80% of vaccine recipients were hospitalized after encountering circulating RSV due to ADE (47). The issue of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine inducing ADE following structural modifications of the surface S-protein is also a concern (48). Unlike chemical inactivation, radiation inactivation in cells can be caused by direct or indirect action on DNA (49). Radiation can directly cause DNA single-or double-strand breaks (50), while the indirect action causes ionization of water or organic molecules in the cell to produce free radicals which react with DNA bases, leading to DNA damage (51). Thus, the two actions can function together to cause various mutations and break down DNA to quickly inactivate the pathogen. In contrast, cellular damage might be relatively less compared to DNA damage because the physical process of ionizing radiation takes a very short reaction time (about 10-15 to 10-12 s) (26, 27, 52). Therefore, the high immunological effect of irradiated vaccines may be due to less damage to surface antigens during vaccine manufacturing.  Another surprising finding in our mouse model was that r-SG induced higher titers of SG-specific IgM, IgG2b, and IgG3, and these antibodies are probably anti-group D antigens. IgG2b and IgG3 antibodies are usually considered to be part of the T-independent response and can be induced at a very early stage of infection (53). A previous study showed that LPS stimulation could induce class switching of IgM to IgG3, and LPS induces high levels of IgG2b and low levels of IgA in the presence of TGF-β (54). However, we did not detect the secretion of TGF-β, and there is another, unknown, mechanism for class switching to IgG2b. In addition, both IgG3 and IgG2b are known to have stronger opsonophagocytosis and bactericidal activities than IgG2a and IgG1 (55), therefore the r-SG vaccine may provide early and robust protective humoral immune responses via IgG3 and IgG2b. In contrast, we detected a relatively low amount of SG-specific T-dependent antibodies (IgG1, IgG2a) by r-SG vaccination, even with aluminum hydroxide as an adjuvant. Therefore, there is a strong need to investigate the impact of a specific adjuvant combination in increasing the Th1 response.  Although we have not been able to directly analyze the response of cellular immunity after r-SG vaccination in chickens, the increase in protective immunity is likely to be due to an increase in cellular immunity. The role of Th1- and Th17-mediated immune responses has been reported in many infectious diseases, such as those caused by Candida, Salmonella, and Pneumococcus (56–59). Following Salmonella infection, the Th17 response in the CD4+ T cell population shifts to a Th1-biased response, and IL-17A, which is increased by Salmonella infection, stimulates intestinal epithelial cells to enhance the production of antimicrobial proteins and chemokines (60, 61). Thus, the higher protective immune response induced by r-SG might be due to Th17-mediated Th1-biased response. Further analysis of the cellular immune responses should be performed on the spleen of chickens given various doses of r-SG vaccine.  Ionizing radiation primarily damages DNA and consequently, the biological responses depending on the radiation track structure and its energy loss distribution pattern (62). However, because it is difficult to investigate the exact mechanism of ionizing radiation at the atomic level, several modeling and simulation programs, such as Geant4-DNA, have been introduced to predict the effects of cellular oxygenation on the chemical processes involving DNA radicals (63). According to Geant4-DNA simulation, low linear energy transfer radiation can cause 0.04 to 0.010 double-strand breaks/Gy/Mbp, indicating that radiation can penetrate the cell nucleus to induce intracellular oxygenation processes for double-strand breaks in DNA. In contrast, formaldehyde causes external damage to the cell through a diffusion mechanism. Therefore, irradiated microorganisms have the potential to be recognized as living microorganisms in part through the interaction of well-conserved surface antigens with immune cells, which can promote the cell-mediated immune response.  In summary, we are the first to develop a gamma radiation-inactivated vaccine to SG that is safer and more effective than live SG 9R or chemically-inactivated SG vaccines. We found that the r-SG vaccine has the advantage of inducing a higher humoral immune response than the live 9R vaccine and a higher cell-mediated immune response than f-SG. Therefore, the development of vaccines using gamma irradiation is expected to be applicable to various infectious diseases as an effective vaccine manufacturing method capable of inducing an immune response at an intermediate level between inactive and live vaccines.

PMC8415480,Introduction,Introduction,AM933173,0,0,0,,,"  Introduction  Salmonellosis is a zoonotic disease that can cause gastroenteritis, diarrhea, and systemic typhoid in humans and animals. Salmonella species are gram-negative, facultatively flagellated bacteria classified on the basis of 46 lipopolysaccharide (LPS, O) and 114 flagella (H) antigens (1). According to this taxonomy, more than 2,610 serotypes have been identified to date (2). Among them, Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Gallinarum (S. Gallinarum; SG) is known to cause invasive salmonellosis, or fowl typhoid-like disease, a septic disease that occurs in both acute and chronic forms in chickens, turkeys, and other birds (3). Although SG infection has largely disappeared in the poultry industry in developed countries, it is still widespread in developing countries, causing enormous annual economic losses (4).  Vaccination of chickens has provided promising protection, and there continues to be progress in the development of a safe and efficacious Salmonella vaccine that provides broad cross-protection for enhancing both animal health and food safety (5). The most commonly used vaccine is a commercial live vaccine derived from a stable rough strain of SG 9R that was developed more than 30 years ago (6). Although the protective efficacy of this vaccine has been reported to be extremely high (7), the remaining pathogenicity in this attenuated strain can also lead to severe systemic infections in immunosuppressive groups such as young chicks (8). In addition, the problem of pathogenic reversion due to natural mutation in this strain has also been reported, leading to an increasing demand for additional vaccine development (9). In fact, SG 9R strains from three different Korean animal vaccine companies show different phenotypic characteristics and vaccine efficacy despite having the same original strain (10).  An inactivated vaccine can be considered as a safer alternative to SG 9R. However, several reports have shown that inactivated SG vaccines are not sufficient to provide protection against salmonellosis and less cross-protective against other Salmonella species, such as Salmonella Pullorum (SP) or Salmonella Enteritidis (SE) because of the low cell-mediated immune response (11, 12). Of the several inactivation methods available for vaccine development, inactivation by irradiation has been reported to enhance the induction of cell-mediated immunity for bacterial and viral vaccines (13, 14). Radiation, such as gamma and X-rays, transfers energy to produce ionization that directly or indirectly damages dsDNA (15). This ionization is completed in picoseconds (~10–12 s), so it is thought that it will cause less immunogenic damage that could induce cellular immunity. The major advantages of ionizing radiation in vaccine development, compared to formalin, are the ability to penetrate most biological materials, and the fact that it targets both double- and single-stranded nucleic acids while causing less damage to antigenic surface proteins. Moreover, there is no need to remove any chemical residue after inactivation  (16). Gamma-irradiated influenza vaccine was more effective at priming cross-reactive cytotoxic T cells and protected mice against a heterologous influenza virus (17). Irradiated bacterial vaccines, such as against Listeria, Mycobacteria, and Bacillus, which prevent replication but retain their metabolic activity, generate higher cell-mediated immune responses and protect against extracellular and intracellular bacteria (14, 18–20).  In this study, we prepared an SG vaccine using gamma irradiation and analyzed its efficacy by measuring the immune response in mice and chickens. This study demonstrates that gamma irradiation is suitable for developing inactivated vaccines against SG and other infectious diseases.  ",FALSE,TRUE,

The best hit was S. enterica subsp. enterica serovar Gallinarum strain 287/91 (accession number: AM933173.1)""","  Materials and Methods  Ethics Statement  This study was performed in strict accordance with the recommendations of the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health. All animal experiments were approved by the Committee on the Use and Care of Animals at the Korea Atomic Energy Research Institute (KAERI; approval no. IACUC-2018-007) and performed according to accepted veterinary standards set by the KAERI animal care center. Mice were euthanized by CO2 inhalation, as specified by the KAERI Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee guidelines.  Bacterial Strains  S. Gallinarum 07Q015 was obtained from the Korea Veterinary Culture Collection (Kimchun, Republic of Korea), and its genome was sequenced using the PacBio RS II platform (Pacific Biosciences, Menlo Park, CA, USA) at Macrogen Co., Ltd. (Seoul, Republic of Korea). The assembled genome of S. Gallinarum 07Q015 contained three contigs, one circular genome (4,624,135 bp) and two plasmids (88,418 bp and 56,404 bp). After complete genome assembly, BLAST analysis (v2.7.1) was carried out to identify the species to which each scaffold showed the highest similarity. The best hit was S. enterica subsp. enterica serovar Gallinarum strain 287/91 (accession number: AM933173.1). The whole genome sequence of S. Gallinarum 07Q015 has been deposited at DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank under accession no. CP077760 (Contig 1), CP077761 (Contig 2), CP077762 (Contig 3). In the challenge experiment, we assessed the median lethal dose (LD50) and the optimal challenge dose by monitoring the survival of mice and chicken for two weeks after S. Gallinarum 07Q015 inoculation intraperitoneally (i.p.) and orally, respectively. The LD50 was calculated using the Reed–Muench method. The optimal challenge doses were at least 10 times higher than LD50, i.e., 5 × 105 CFU for mice and 3 × 107 CFU for chicken.  Preparation of Radiation- or Formalin-Inactivated SG (r-SG or f-SG)  Salmonella was grown in Luria-Bertani (LB; Difco, BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) broth at 37°C and 200 rpm under aerobic conditions. When the bacteria culture reached an optical density (OD600) of 0.8, it was pelleted by centrifugation at 7000 rpm for 20 min at 4°C and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Harvested SG (108–109 CFU/mL) was irradiated using a 60Co-gamma irradiator (point source AECL, IR-79, MDS Nordion International Co., Ottawa, Canada) at the Advanced Radiation Technology Institute of KAERI (Jeongeup, Republic of Korea) with an absorbed dose of 0.5–9 kGy for 1 h at 23°C. f-SG was prepared by incubation with 0.2% formaldehyde solution (JUNSEI; Tokyo, Japan) under mild agitation at 23 - 28°C for 2 h. To confirm inactivation of the prepared vaccines, samples were inoculated in LB broth and cultured for 3 d to assess SG growth.  Quantification of DNA Damage  Genomic DNA was extracted using a G-spin™ Genomic DNA extraction Kit (INTRON Inc., Seoul, Republic of Korea). The genomic DNA concentration was measured using a spectrophotometer (Epoch 2; BioTek, Winooski, VT, USA) and titrated to 100 μg/mL in 10mM Tris-EDTA buffer. To quantify single-strand DNA breaks, a DNA Damage Quantification Kit (Dojindo Laboratories, Kumamoto, Japan) was used according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, genomic DNA (1 µg) was labeled with an aldehyde reactive probe conjugated with biotin, through incubation at 37°C for 1 h. Labeled DNA was immobilized on a 96-well U-bottom microplate (Dojindo) and incubated at 23°C overnight. Bound biotin-conjugated aldehyde reactive probe on immobilized genomic DNA was detected using peroxidase-streptavidin and the OD of the conjugated aldehyde reactive probe was measured at 650 nm after adding 100 µL of 3,3’,5,5’-tetramethylbenzidine substrate solution.  Measurement of Protein Carbonylation  SG samples were sonicated using a TECAN sonicator (TECAN; Osaka, Japan) for 1 min on ice. The samples were then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4°C. Protein concentration and purity were measured using absorbance at 280 nm and 260 nm, respectively. Protein carbonylation was measured using a Protein Carbonyl Colorimetric Assay Kit (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. In brief, 200 µL of the sample was mixed with 800 µL of 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine and 800 µL of 2.5 M HCl. After the sample was incubated for 1 h at room temperature, the proteins were precipitated using 20% trichloroacetic acid at 4°C for 5 min. After centrifugation, the pellet was washed with 1 mL of a mixture of ethanol and ethyl acetate (1:1, v/v) and resuspended with protein pellets in 500 µL of guanidine hydrochloride. The OD of the pellet was measured at 360–385 nm.  Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) Analysis  Live SG, r-SG, and f-SG were fixed with 4% glutaraldehyde overnight at 4°C. After centrifugation (13,000 rpm), the samples were washed three times with PBS and dehydrated through a graded ethanol series (30%, 50%, and 70%) followed by drying the cells. The samples were gold-coated using a gold sputtering unit and then observed using a JEOL JSM-840 scanning microscope (Tokyo, Japan) at the Seoul National University.  Mouse and Chicken Experiments  The animal housing conditions, which were designed for specific pathogen-free animals, and the animal experimental design were approved by the Committee on the Use and Care of Animals at the KAERI and implemented ethically according to the standards accepted by the National Health of Institute. The ventilated housing cage (Orient Bio Inc., Seoul, Republic of Korea) was maintained in an animal biological safety level 2 facility at 22–23°C on a 12 h:12 h light:dark cycle. The cages were covered with high-efficiency particulate air-filtered microisolation lids (Orient Bio Inc.) in a static airflow environment. Bedding (Aspen shavings; Orient Bio Inc.) at an approximate depth of 1.0 cm was changed weekly. Irradiated rodent diet food and sterile water were provided ad libitum through a wire cage top. Five-week-old male C57BL/6 mice (weight 19–21 g) were purchased from Orient Bio Inc. Five C57BL/6 mice were randomly assigned to individually ventilated housing cages and immunized i.p. three times at two-week intervals with either PBS, r-SG, or f-SG mixed with the same volume of 2% Alhydrogel® adjuvant (InvivoGen, San Diego, CA, USA). No significant weight loss, mortality, or serious clinical signs were observed after vaccination. Two weeks after the third vaccination, blood was collected to measure SG-specific antibodies, and the spleen was collected to measure SG-specific T cell responses. To examine the protective efficacy of the vaccination, mice were challenged i.p. with S. Gallinarum 07Q015 (5 × 105 CFU/mouse) two weeks after the third vaccination. Mouse survival was monitored for 12 d.  Five-week-old female Brown Leghorn chickens (weight 5-6 lb) were purchased from JOIN Inc. (Pyeongtaek, Korea) and placed into chicken isolator (Three-shine Inc.; Daejeong, Korea) containing mesh wire on the floor of the cages. Each cage housed not more than 5 chickens. Chickens were given tap water and commercial chick feed ad libitum. Air and light were supplied freely through the hole and windows. All purchased chickens were confirmed to be negative for Salmonella infection by confirming with Salmonella diagnosis PCR with Primers 3503 (AGC GTA CTG GAA AGG AG) and 5503 (ATA CCG CCA ATA AAG TTC ACA AAG) (21). Chickens adapt to the new environment for one week. All chickens were acclimatized according to the protocols of the Central Animal Research Laboratory at Chunbuk National University (Iksan, Republic of Korea). For vaccination, chickens (n = 10/group) were vaccinated into the breast muscle twice at three-week intervals with r-SG (3 × 108 CFU), f-SG (3 × 108 CFU), or live 9R strain (2 × 107 CFU) of 0.5 mL. Three weeks after the second vaccination, chicken blood was collected 5 mL each from brachial wing vein, and serum was harvested from the supernatant of coagulated blood. All serum were stored at 4°C until performing enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and opsonophagocytic killing assay (OPKA). For Salmonella challenge study, S. Gallinarum 07Q015 were inoculated into 10 mL LB and incubated at 37°C with orbital shaking (200 rpm) for 24 h. Subsequently, 0.5 mL of precultures bacteria was transferred into 50 mL LB and incubated with orbital shaking (200 rpm) at 37°C for about 6 h. The challenge inoculum was prepared by diluting S. Gallinarum culture in LB to a final viable concentration of 6 × 107 CFU/mL and used immediately for oral infection. The number of S. Gallinarum inoculums was determined both before and after challenge. Three weeks after the second vaccination, chickens were orally challenged with 0.5 mL of S. Gallinarum 07Q015 (3 × 107 CFU/chicken) as inoculum using a syringe, whereas uninfected chickens were given with the same amount of LB. Chicken survival was monitored daily for 15 d. Any chicken that died or had to be euthanized during the observation period was immediately necropsied and all the remaining chickens at the end of the experiment were euthanized.  Measurement of Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-Specific Immunoglobulin Levels  Blood samples from mice and chickens were obtained 14 d after the last vaccination. Salmonella antigen lysates were prepared as described previously (22). Salmonella Gallinarum (SG), Salmonella Typhimurium (ST), Salmonella Enteritidis (SE), and Salmonella Pullorum (SP) were grown in LB broth and harvested at OD600 = 0.8. The pellet was washed with PBS followed by sonication 30 times for 5 s. Samples were centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 10 min at 4°C, and the supernatants were collected and stored at –70°C. Total protein concentration was measured using the Pierce™ BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). To examine the levels of SG-specific immunoglobulins (Igs), Salmonella lysate (10 μg/well), group D LPS (1 μg/well; Sigma-Aldrich; St. Louis, MO), and group B LPS (1 μg/well; Sigma-Aldrich) were immobilized on 96-well plates for 16 h at 4°C, followed by blocking with 1% BSA in PBS. After washing three times with PBS containing 0.05% Tween-20 (PBS-T; Sigma-Aldrich), serial two-fold dilutions of mouse or chicken serum (100 μL) were added to each well and incubated at 23°C for 2 h. The plates were washed five times with PBS-T to remove unbound antibodies, and bound antibodies were detected using horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-mouse Igs (anti-mouse IgM, IgG, IgG1, IgG2a, IgG2b, and IgG3; 1:5000 dilution in PBS-T; Sigma-Aldrich) or HRP-conjugated anti-chicken IgM and IgG (1:5000 dilution in PBS-T; Southern Biotech, Birmingham, AL, USA) for 1 h at room temperature. After washing seven times with PBS-T, 100 μL of 3,3’,5,5’-tetramethylbenzidine substrate solution (INTRON) was added, followed by incubation for 5–10 min at 23°C. When the color was sufficiently developed, 50 μL of 2 N H2SO4 stop solution (Daejung Chemicals; Siheung, Republic of Korea) was added. The absorbance at 450 nm was measured using an Epoch 2 plate reader (BioTek).  Opsonophagocytic Killing Assay (OPKA)  The functional activity of SG-specific antibodies induced by each vaccine was assessed using OPKA as described previously (23). A 10 μL aliquot of bacteria (100–250 CFU) was incubated with three-fold serially diluted heat-inactivated sera (final 20 μL/well) with OBB (Opsonization buffer B, 1X HBSS buffer containing 0.1% gelatin and 0.5% heat inactivated FBS) at 37°C for 30 min, followed by mixing with 40 μL of differentiated HL60 granulocytic cells (1 × 107 cells; ATCC; Manassas, VA, USA) and 10 μL of 3–4-week-old baby rabbit complement (PelFreeze Biologicals, Rogers, AR, USA). After incubating at 37°C for 45 min, the reaction was stopped by incubating on ice for 20 min. Next, 10 μL of samples were spotted on LB agar plates and the colonies were counted using NIST’s Integrated Colony Enumerator software (NICE; Gaithersburg, MD, USA) and opsonic indices (OIs) were analyzed using the Opsonization Index Program (“opsotiter3”) kindly provided by Prof. Nahm (University of Alabama at Birmingham).  Splenocyte Analysis by Flow Cytometry  Two weeks after the final immunization, spleens from mice immunized with either the r-SG or f-SG vaccine were isolated and filtered through a cell strainer (70 µm; SPL Life Sciences, Pocheon, Republic of Korea). Red blood cells (RBCs) were lysed with RBC lysis buffer (Sigma-Aldrich) and washed with RPMI-1640 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Biowest, Nuaillé, France). The cell suspension was seeded into a 48-well plate (2 × 106 cells/well) and stimulated with 10 µg/mL SG lysate, 0.5 µg/mL GolgiStop (BD Bioscience, San Diego, CA, USA), and 0.5 µg/mL GolgiPlug (BD Bioscience) at 37°C for 12 h. The cells were washed with PBS and stained with a Live/Dead Staining Kit (InvivoGen, San Diego, CA, USA), anti-CD8-FITC (BD Bioscience), and anti-CD4-BV421 (BD Biosciences) for 20 min at 23°C to stain T cell surface markers. Cells were fixed and permeabilized using a Cytofix/Cytoperm kit (BD Bioscience) for 20 min at 4°C, and then intracellular cytokines were stained with anti-IFN-γ-PE (BD Biosciences), anti-IL-5-APC (BD Bioscience), and anti-IL-17A-PE-Cy7 (BD Bioscience) for 20 min at 23°C. After staining, the cells were analyzed using a MACS Quant flow cytometer (Miltenyi Biotec, San Diego, CA, USA) and FlowJo software (TreeStar, Ashland, OR, USA).  Cytokine ELISA  Splenocyte culture supernatants prepared as described above were collected, and the levels of IFN-γ, IL-5, IL-17A, TNF-α, IL-10, and TGF-β were measured using an ELISA kit (eBioscience Inc., San Diego, CA, USA).  Adoptive Transfer of CD4+ or CD8+ T Cells  Mouse spleen cell suspensions were prepared by passing spleen specimens through a nylon cell strainer (BD Biosciences), and red blood cells were lysed with FACS Lysing Solution (BD Biosciences). Splenic CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were separated using Miltenyi MACS microbeads conjugated with anti-CD4 and anti-CD8 monoclonal antibodies (Miltenyi Biotec) and a MACS LS column (Miltenyi Biotec). Isolated CD4+ or CD8+ T cells (5 × 105 cells/mouse) were administered i.p. to naïve C57BL/6 mice (n = 7). After 12 h, mice were challenged i.p. with S. Gallinarum 07Q015 (5 × 105 CFU/mouse) and mouse survival was monitored for 12 d.  Statistical Analysis  Data are expressed as the mean ± standard deviation (SD). Data in the bar and dot graphs between groups were compared using an unpaired Student’s t-test for normal data distribution or the Mann–Whitney non-parametric test for abnormal data distribution using GraphPad Prism (version 7.0; GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA). The survival of mice was determined using Kaplan–Meier survival analysis, and the significance of the difference was analyzed using a log-rank test with GraphPad Prism software. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.  ",TRUE,TRUE,

PMC8415480,Results,Results and Discussion,AM933173,0,0,0,,,"  Results  Preparation of an Inactivated S. Gallinarum Vaccine  The formalin inactivation method used in this study followed the bacterial vaccine manufacturing protocol of the Korean Animal and Plant Quarantine, in which SG (108–109 CFU/mL) was treated with 0.2% formaldehyde solution in PBS for 2 h at 37°C. For radiation-inactivated SG vaccines, a value between −103 and −106 was applied according to the ‘Sterility Assurance Level (SAL)’ used in the manufacture of sterile viruses (24, 25). To measure the SAL value, harvested SG (108–109 CFU/mL) in PBS were irradiated with gamma rays at the indicated dose for 1 h, and serially diluted samples were plated onto blood agar plate (BAP) (Figure 1A). No bacteria were detected on BAP at 3~4 kGy. SAL values of –103 and –106 were calculated as assessed by linear regression performed with all viable count data, indicating that SAL values of –103 and –106 were obtained with doses of 5.442 kGy and 6.879 kGy, respectively. Thus, 6 kGy was chosen as the radiation inactivation dose for SG (Figure 1B). After inactivating SG with either formalin or radiation, 1 mL inactivated bacteria was inoculated into 9 mL LB and incubated for 7 d to confirm complete inactivation.  Figure 1  Production and characterization of inactivated SG vaccines. (A) Schematic procedure for r-SG and f-SG vaccine production. (B) Radiation-inactivated vaccine was produced according to the ‘Sterility Assurance Level (SAL).’ SG was harvested and re-suspended in PBS and irradiated with the indicated dose of gamma radiation (60Co gamma-ray source) and plated on LB agar to count the number of surviving bacteria. No SG was detected in samples irradiated with doses of gamma radiation >3 kGy. (C) Measurement of single strand chromosomal DNA breaks and (D) bacterial protein carbonylation after radiation- or formalin-inactivation. (E) The surface structure of SG, r-SG, and f-SG visualized by scanning electron microscopy.  When radiation passes through a cell, it induces an ionization process that produces free radicals via the radiolysis of water (26–28), causing DNA damage. To determine whether the radiation inactivation method successfully induced SG DNA damage, Aldehyde Reactive Probe (ARP) was used to examine the DNA single-strand break rate of the SG chromosome (29). As shown in Figure 1C, SG DNA damage extensively increased with increased irradiation dose, and approximately (23.252 ± 0.253) sites/100,000 bp damage was detected at 6 kGy. In contrast, only (1.216 ± 0.102) sites/100,000 bp were detected with f-SG, which was comparable to live SG ([0.058 ± 0.001] sites/100,000 bp).  Since formalin- and radiation-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) can induce protein antigen damage by carbonylation, which can trigger a Th2-biased immune response, the degree of carbonylation was analyzed by a 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine (DNPH) immunoassay (30). As shown in Figure 1D, r-SG (6 kGy inactivating does) did not show a significant increase in carbonylation ([0.955 ± 0.032] nmol/mL) compared to live SG ([1.602 ± 0.048] nmol/mL). However, 0.2% f-SG exhibited 4.8-fold higher carbonylation ([4.591 ± 0.450] nmol/mL) compared to r-SG (Figure 1D). To directly visualize the extracellular structures of live SG, r-SG, and f-SG, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was performed. As shown in Figure 1E, there were no substantial differences in the extracellular structure between the groups.  Vaccination With r-SG Causes a Stronger Humoral Immune Response  Because previous studies indicated that high carbonylation induced by formalin treatment decreased antigen-specific humoral immune responses (31, 32), we compared r-SG with f-SG in vivo. Mice (n = 5 per group) were immunized i.p. with either 105 or 106 CFU of either r-SG or f-SG vaccine three times at two week intervals, then the SG-specific serum antibody titer was measured two weeks after the last immunization (Figure 2A). SG-specific IgM and IgG were increased in a dose-dependent manner by immunizing with either r-SG or f-SG. However, the group immunized with 106 CFU r-SG showed significant enhancement in SG-specific IgM (4,320 ± 2,170) and IgG (5,760 ± 2,061) compared to the f-SG vaccination group (600 ± 126 for IgM, 800 ± 0 for IgG) (Figures 2B, C). To determine whether this SG-specific IgG enhancement by r-SG vaccination was due to a Th1- or Th2-biased IgG response, we analyzed the levels of IgG subclasses. As shown in Figures 2D, E, both IgG1 (Th2; 1,020 ± 618) and IgG2a (Th1; 220 ± 78) were modestly increased in the r-SG group, but not significantly when compared to the PBS (188 ± 77 for IgG1, 75 ± 14 for IgG2a) and f-SG (70 ± 12 for IgG1, 50 ± 0 for IgG2a) groups. Surprisingly, T-independent antibodies IgG2b (r-SG: 1,160 ± 682, f-SG: 170 ± 62) and IgG3 (r-SG: 8,990 ± 4,775, f-SG: 70 ± 12) were found to be significantly increased in the r-SG group (Figures 2F, G).  Figure 2  Analysis of humoral immune responses induced by immunization of r-SG or f-SG. Mice (n = 5 per group) were immunized i.p. with either 1 × 105 CFU or 1 × 106 CFU of r-SG or f-SG three times at two week intervals and sera were collected two weeks after the last vaccination. (A) Schematic overview of mice study design. SG-specific (B) IgM and (C) IgG and IgG subclasses (D) IgG1, (E) IgG2a, (F) IgG2b, and (G) IgG3 in sera were measured by ELISA. (H) Immunized mice (n = 6 per group) were infected i.p. with 5 × 105 CFU SG WT strain and survival was monitored for 12 d. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01 compared to PBS group. #P < 0.05, ##P < 0.01 compared to f-SG vaccinated group.  To confirm whether the SG-specific immune responses induced by the r-SG vaccine could provide protection against SG, immunized mice (n = 6 per group) were i.p. challenged with 5 × 105 CFU WT SG two weeks after the last immunization. While only 16% of PBS-immunized mice, and 33% of f-SG-immunized mice, survived by 6 d post-injection, 100% of r-SG-immunized mice survived at 12 d post-injection. This suggested that r-SG might induce more potent humoral and protective immune responses than f-SG (Figure 2H).  Higher Functional Antibody Responses Induced by r-SG  IgG2b and IgG3 have long been considered the key subclasses produced in response to carbohydrates and other T-independent antigens, such as LPS and pneumococcal polysaccharide. Thus, we next sought to confirm that the higher T-independent humoral immune response observed was due to the immune response to SG serogroup D carbohydrate by measuring homogeneous antibody titers of SG-immunized mouse sera against serogroup D (SE, SP) and serogroup B (ST) strains. Sera isolated from mice immunized with 106 CFU of either r-SG or f-SG were used to determine the levels of SE-, SP-, or ST-specific antibody titers by ELISA. As shown in Figures 3A, B, serogroup D Salmonella (SE and SP)-specific IgM (r-SG: 425 ± 143, 325 ± 75 f-SG: 80 ± 12, 60 ± 10) and IgG (r-SG: 1,800 ± 503, 325 ± 75 f-SG: 280 ± 48, 60 ± 10) isotype responses increased significantly in the sera of r-SG-immunized mice. As mentioned above, the major subclasses of IgG were IgG2b and IgG3 against SE and SP. In contrast, no significant levels of IgM (r-SG: 50 ± 0, f-SG: 50 ± 0) and IgG (r-SG: 1,500 ± 619, f-SG: 440 ± 97) were detected in serogroup B Salmonella (ST) (Figure 3C). Moreover, we found that these serogroup specific antibodies bound only to serogroup D LPS, not serogroup B LPS (Supplementary Figure 1). These data indicate that r-SG-induced IgG2b, and IgG3 antibodies were mostly group D-specific. Furthermore, we found that both r-SG and f-SG boosted high group D LPS-specific IgG and IgM, but not group B LPS-specific antibodies.  Figure 3  Homogeneous antibody responses by r-SG against Group D Salmonella. Mice (n = 5 per group) were immunized i.p. with 1 × 106 CFU of r-SG or f-SG three times at two week intervals and sera were collected two weeks after the last vaccination. (A) SE-specific IgM and IgG, (B) SP-specific IgM and IgG, and (C) ST-specific IgM and IgG in sera were measured by ELISA. (D) Summary of opsonization indices for r-SG and f-SG vaccines against serogroup D (SG, SE, and SP) and serogroup B (ST) Salmonella. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, n.s., not significant, compared to unvaccinated mice.  To demonstrate that the increase in the homogeneous IgG response was not due to non-specific binding to the immobilized antigen, we measured the functional activity of SG-immunized mouse sera using an OPKA, as described previously (33). Live SG, SE, SP, or ST (100–250 CFU) were incubated for 45 min at 37°C with the pooled SG-immunized sera together with baby rabbit complement and differentiated granulocytes (HL60), and the surviving bacteria were counted on LB agar plates. As shown in Figure 3D, the opsonic index (OI; 50% killing serum titer) of PBS-immunized sera (control) was 200, which is the OPKA detection limit in all Salmonella groups. Sera immunized with f-SG showed OI of 28,970 to SG, but <2,000 for other serogroups. In contrast, sera immunized with r-SG had extremely high OI titers against group D Salmonella: 311,751 (SG), 776,716 (SE), and 1,749,600 (SP); while OI titers to ST were only 200. These results confirmed that the radiation inactivation method induced a higher serotype-specific humoral immune response than the formalin inactivation.  Higher SG-Specific Th17 Cell Immunity Induced by r-SG  To more accurately confirm the immune-induced response to r-SG, we analyzed cell-mediated immune activity in a population of activated CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in vivo. Mice (n = 5 per group) were immunized i.p. with PBS, r-SG (106 CFU), or f-SG (106 CFU) three times at two week intervals, and single cell suspensions of splenocytes were re-stimulated with 10 µg/mL SG lysate followed by analysis of Th1 (IFN-γ-producing CD4+ T cells), Th2 (IL-5-producing CD4+ T cells), Th17 (IL-17A-producing CD4+ T cells), and activated CD8+ T cells (IFN-γ-producing CD8+ T cells) by gating (Figure 4A). As shown in Figure 4B, any group immunized with either r-SG or f-SG showed no significant difference in IL-5+CD4+ cells compared to the PBS group. Only the r-SG-immunized group showed a significant level of IFN-γ+CD4+ (r-SG: 7.12 ± 0.56, f-SG: 5.50 ± 0.44; P = 0.005) and IL-17A+CD4+ cells (r-SG: 1.34 ± 0.19, f-SG: 0.99 ± 0.18; P = 0.03). Both the r-SG and f-SG groups had significant increases in IFN-γ+CD8+ cells compared to the PBS group, but no differences were found between the r-SG and f-SG groups.  Figure 4  Analysis of SG-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses. Mice (n = 5 per group) were immunized i.p. with 1 × 106 CFU of r-SG or f-SG three times at two week intervals. Spleen cell suspensions were re-stimulated with 10 μg/mL SG lysate for 12 h and SG-specific Th1 (IFN-γ-expressing CD4+ T cells), Th2 (IL-5-expressing CD4+ T cells), Th17 (IL-17A-expressing CD4+ T cells), and activated CD8+ T cells (IFN-γ-producing CD8+ T cells) were analyzed by intracellular cytokine staining based on the T cell-specific makers (anti-CD4, and anti-CD8). (A) Representative plots for Th1, Th2, Th17, and activated CD8+ T cells in spleens from PBS-, r-SG-, and f-SG-vaccinated mice. (B) Percentages of Th1, Th2, Th17, and activated CD8+ T cells in spleens of all vaccinated mice. The mean ± SD shown are representative of three independent experiments. (C) Single cell suspensions of splenocytes were treated with 10 μg/mL SG lysate for 72 h, and supernatants were collected for determination of SG-specific cytokines (IFN-γ, IL-5, IL-17A, TNF-α, IL-10, and TGF-b) using ELISA. The mean ± SD shown are representative of two independent experiments. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, and ***P < 0.001, n.s., not significant, compared with unvaccinated mice (D) Splenic CD4+ or (E) CD8+ T cells from naïve (n = 7) or r-SG- or f-SG- vaccinated mice were pooled and transferred i.p. to mice. At 12 h after inoculation, mice were challenged i.p. with 5 × 105 CFU SG WT strain. Mouse survival was monitored for 10 d. ***P < 0.001, compared with unvaccinated mice. ##P < 0.01, n.s., not significant, compared with f-SG vaccinated mice.  Next, the levels of cytokines secreted from splenocytes in response to SG lysate stimulation were measured by ELISA (Figure 4C). Consistent with the above results, significantly higher levels of IFN-γ and IL-17A were detected in the r-SG group compared to the PBS and f-SG groups, but IL-5 production was not detected in any group. In addition, we measured the levels of additional cytokines (IL-10 and TNF-α) associated with Salmonella infections (34, 35). TNF-α was significantly increased (r-SG: 359.1 ± 30.53, f-SG: 234.8 ± 12.3; P = 0.0054), but a modest increase of IL-10 was observed in the r-SG group compared to the f-SG group. Although TGF-β is known to be required for class-switching from IgG3 to IgG2b (36), no significant production of TGF-β was detected in either the r-SG or f-SG groups These data confirm that r-SG could induce higher SG-specific immune responses in the direction of Th1 and Th17, and that a higher IgG2b humoral response was not likely to be in the direction of the TGF-β pathway.  To directly examine whether T cells memorized via the r-SG or f-SG vaccine could protect against SG infection, either splenic CD4+ or CD8+ T cells were isolated from immunized mice and then transferred to naïve mice via the i.p. route. Mice were then challenged with a lethal dose of SG (5 × 105 CFU) 16 h after adaptive transfer. As shown in Figures 4D, E, the group that received CD4+ T cells from PBS- or f-SG-vaccinated mice died within 5 d after injection, whereas the group that received CD4+ T cells from r-SG-vaccinated mice showed 40% survival during the monitoring period, which was significant compared to the PBS (P < 0.0001) and f-SG (P = 0.003) groups. In contrast, mice that received CD8+ T cells from r-SG- or f-SG-vaccinated donors survived longer than mice in the PBS group, but no significant differences were found between the r-SG and f-SG groups, which correlated with the flow cytometry and ELISA data above. These data suggest that the higher protective immune response induced by the r-SG vaccine could be caused in part by higher activated CD4+ T cells, particularly associated with Th1 and Th17 cells.  Higher Protective Immune Responses by r-SG Vaccination in Chickens  To compare the efficacy of the vaccine between r-SG and f-SG in chickens, five-week-old female Brown Leghorn chickens were immunized with r-SG (3 × 108 CFU), f-SG (3 × 108 CFU), or commercial 9R live vaccine (2 × 107 CFU) twice at three-week intervals (Figure 5A). Sera were collected 14 d after the last vaccination, and serogroup D Salmonella (SG, SE, and SP)-specific IgG were measured using ELISA. As shown in Figure 5B, all groups immunized with r-SG, f-SG, or 9R showed a significant increase in Group D-specific IgG antibodies (r-SG: 50,220 ± 18,491, f-SG: 57,780 ± 17,779, 9R: 37,260 ± 14,070) compared to the unvaccinated group, but there was no significant difference among the vaccinated groups. Next, we measured the functional activity of SG-immunized chicken sera using OPKA against live SG. As shown in Figure 5C, the opsonic index (OI; 50% killing serum titer) was 105 ± 65 (PBS), 15,376 ± 6,332 (r-SG), 12,318 ± 3,069 (f-SG), and 553 ± 245 (9R) indicating that both f-SG and r-SG induced higher functional SG-specific antibodies than the live 9R vaccine (Figure 5C).

PMC8557374,CONCLUDING REMARKS,Other,GCA_000696285,0,0,0,?,"Referring to genomes or organisms here?....""harboured by different Bacillus species distributed at very different geographical locations around the world""","  CONCLUDING REMARKS  Here we show that pLS20 constitutes the prototype of a family of related plasmids that are harboured by different Bacillus species distributed at very different geographical locations around the world. Although the plasmids share a conserved structural organization, they could be divided into four clades. Besides a variable region located in between the partition and conjugation modules, all the plasmids contain three conserved modules: a replication, a partitioning and a conjugation module. In addition, plasmids belonging to clades I and IV contain a DNA repair module that is comprised by genes uvrX and yolD, while plasmids belonging to clade II and two of the three clade III plasmids only contain a yolD gene. The very large conjugation module can be divided into two subregions. Except for one, all the other plasmids contain a 5′-located region of three genes that are responsible for controlling the activation of the conjugation pathway. This region is followed by a very large operon encoding all the genes required for the different steps of the conjugation pathway. Remarkably, the sequential steps of the conjugation process are reflected by the order of genes within the conjugation operon. Thus, the first two genes of the conjugation operon constitute a bipartite P-AT system. These two genes are followed by genes involved in the first steps of the conjugation process: selection of and attachment to a recipient cell. The regions downstream are occupied respectively by genes encoding proteins involved in steps two (generation of the T4SS), three (DNA processing) and four (conversion of single-stranded to double-stranded plasmid DNA). Comparative analysis of representative plasmids of the different clades revealed that most of the genes located in the conjugation operons are conserved in all plasmids, indicating that these perform important functions. In addition, some plasmids contain a few or several unique genes that may contribute additional features. The results of the comparative analyses are useful for future studies, not only allowing conserved and unique genes between plasmids of the pLS20 family to be differentiated, and conserved residues or regions within homologous protein to be identified, our analyses also help better understanding of the relationship between the pLS20 family plasmids and other conjugative plasmids of G+ bacteria.

PMC8557374,INTRODUCTION,Introduction,GCA_000696285,1,0,0,,"""The majority of these were not annotated as a plasmid but we reconstructed them from multiple contigs that are present in different next-generation sequencing (NGS) projects. ""","  INTRODUCTION  Many bacteria possess autonomously replicating extrachromosomal DNA molecules named plasmids, which are composed of essential and—most often—one or more modules that are non-essential to the plasmid (1–3). In this work, we define a module as a DNA region containing all the genes and/or genetic information for performing a function or cellular process. One of the modules that is essential for all plasmids concerns a replication module responsible for regulating (initiation of) DNA replication and thereby controlling the plasmid copy number. Most plasmids replicate via the theta or the rolling-circle mechanism. Large low-copy number theta-replicating plasmids contain a segregation module whose encoded proteins ensure faithful partitioning of the plasmid during cell division. A large subset of plasmids is mobile due to the presence of a non-essential module allowing the plasmid to transfer itself horizontally to other cells via conjugation or mobilization (see below). Genes encoding virulence determinants, toxins or antibiotic resistance are often present on conjugative or mobilizable plasmids, and so can efficiently spread, causing major clinical problems and enormous economic consequences worldwide (4,5). A better understanding of the conjugation and mobilization processes is warranted to help develop drugs and strategies impeding the spread of pernicious genes by these transfer routes.  Conjugation modules comprise all the genes required for performing the following steps in the conjugation process. First, selection of and attachment to the recipient cell. Two, generation of a sophisticated translocation channel, a type IV secretion system (T4SS), connecting the donor and the recipient cells. Three, DNA processing generating the DNA form that is transferred, which in most cases is a single DNA-strand (ssDNA), and subsequent transport of the ssDNA strand through the T4SS. Finally, establishment of the transferred DNA in the recipient cell by converting the ssDNA into a double-stranded DNA molecule. Mobilizable plasmids only encode the proteins involved in the DNA processing reaction and exploit the proteins generated by a conjugative plasmid that are necessary for transfer. Because the conjugation process involves many genes, conjugative plasmids are large and use the theta type of replication during growth. Mobilizable plasmids are much smaller and can use the theta or rolling circle mechanism of replication. Conjugative elements can also be embedded in the bacterial chromosome, which are then named integrated and conjugative elements (ICE). Excellent reviews on the process of conjugation have been published elsewhere (6–13).  Conjugation occurs in both Gram-positive (G+) and Gram-negative (G-) bacteria. However, conjugative elements from G+ bacteria are less well studied than those from G− and the available information is based on a very limited number of conjugative plasmids that share little similarity between them. Although these studies have provided important insights, results on conjugation systems will have added relevance and impacts if they concern a prototype plasmid representing a family of related plasmids. For instance, comprehensive analysis of multiple related sequences may discriminate essential from non-essential genes and identify conserved regions or residues within a set of orthologous proteins that may be important for function.  The conjugative plasmid pLS20 (≈65 kb) was originally identified from the Bacillus subtilis natto strain IFO3335 (14). We chose to study pLS20 because it was the only known conjugative B. subtilis plasmid at the time we started, and its replication and partition module had already been identified and characterized (15–17). Contrary to most conjugative systems, pLS20 conjugates efficiently in both solid and liquid media (18–21). Since conjugation in liquid medium is rapid and gives very reproducible results, pLS20 is an attractive system to study conjugation. In the recent years, considerable progress has been made in understanding some aspects of the pLS20 conjugation process, particularly about mating pair formation, regulation of the conjugation genes and the DNA processing reaction (21–29).  Previously, we have shown that the 43 kb plasmid p576 from the Bacillus pumilus strain NRS576 isolated from the USA is related to pLS20 that was isolated from a B. subtilis natto strain in Japan (30–33). This suggested that pLS20 might be the prototype of a family of related plasmids. Here, we show that this is indeed the case. We have identified 35 plasmids in the public databases that are related to pLS20. The majority of these were not annotated as a plasmid but we reconstructed them from multiple contigs that are present in different next-generation sequencing (NGS) projects. All these 35 plasmids are harboured by different Bacillus species, and they could be classified into four clades. The identified plasmids have a conserved organization sharing similar origin, partitioning and conjugation modules, as well as several genes of unknown function. In addition, the majority of these pLS20 family plasmids also contain a DNA repair module. The (dis)similarities between the plasmids are analysed and discussed, providing important information for our understanding of these important and wide spread plasmids, and for future research in conjugation-related studies in general, particularly for those in G+ bacteria.

PMC8557374,MATERIALS AND METHODS,Materials and Methods,GCA_000696285,0,0,0,,This paper doesn't make much sense because the methods section doesn't describe any of the work that's laid out in the results/discussions. There are basically two sets of methods here.,"  MATERIALS AND METHODS  Bacterial strains, plasmids and oligonucleotides  Bacterial strains were grown in Lysogeny Broth (LB) medium (34) or plated on LB plates containing 1.5% agar. When appropriate, the following antibiotics were added: ampicillin (100 μg/ml) for Escherichia coli. The strains, plasmids and oligonucleotides used are listed in Supplementary Tables S1, S2 and S3, respectively. All oligonucleotides were purchased from Isogen Life Science, The Netherlands.  DNA isolation and large plasmid screening  Bacillus strains were grown overnight at 37°C with shaking (180 RPM) in fresh LB medium in a total volume of 12 ml. The next day, 10 ml of the culture was pelleted in 5 Eppendorf tubes of 2 ml and processed as follows. Bacterial pellets were resuspended in 1 ml of Birnboim solution A (20% sucrose, 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.1, 10 mM EDTA and 50 mM NaCl) to which lysozyme was added freshly (2 mg/ml). After freezing the samples at -80°C and subsequent thawing, the tubes were incubated at 37°C with shaking during 15 min. The cells were lysed by adding 33 μl of 1% sarkosyl solution and proteinase K (100 μg/ml) to 1 ml of cell suspension and incubating the mixture at 60°C without shaking during 20 min. Next, the mixture was subjected to a phenol-chloroform extraction step and subsequently precipitated overnight in the presence of 96% ethanol. After washing with 70% ethanol solution, resulting DNA pellets were resuspended in sterile MiliQ water and treated with RNAse A. Finally, DNA samples (1–2 μl) were loaded on a 0.7% agarose gel (1× TBE buffer) without EtBr and run at 30 V for 16 h. Next, gels were stained with a 1xTBE solution containing EtBr for 2 h, followed by a destaining step and finally photographed under ultraviolet light.  Sequencing  Circularization of pBatNRS213  Plasmid pBatNRS213 was circularized as follows. A PCR was performed using total DNA extract of B. atrophaeus strain NRS213 as template DNA in combination with the outward oriented oligos oJV216 and oJV217 that hybridize near the ends of the linear contig corresponding to pBatNRS213 plasmid. The PCR product was digested with SalI and ligated into pBluescript II KS (+) vector linearized with the same restriction enzyme. The ligation mixture was used to transform competent E. coli XL-blue strain, and transformants were selected on LB agar plates supplemented with ampicillin, IPTG (1 mM) and X-gal (60 μg/ml). Some at randomly chosen colonies that had a white colour were analysed by colony PCR for the presence of an insert using oligos M13Fw-21_ext and M13-R. The positively identified derivative was named pJV40. The insert was sequenced by the Sanger method using oligos M13Fw-21_ext and M13-R.  Next-generation sequencing (NGS) of strain B. amyloliquefaciens B1895  A total DNA sample of B. amyloliquefaciens B1895 strain was used for sequence determination using the Illumina MiSeq platform. Preparation of samples and sequencing was done in collaboration with Dr Ricardo Ramos Parque Científico de Madrid (Madrid, Spain). DNA libraries were prepared with the NEBNext DNA library prep kit for Illumina (New England Biolabs). Briefly, 1 μg DNA was sonicated, and fragments of □675 or 1075 bp were selected. DNA ends were repaired, A-tailed and then ligated to adapters. Next, fragments were PCR amplified (8 cycles) and quality checked on a DNA 7500 chip on a 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent). Library sizes of 800 and 1200 bp were isolated, validated (Bioanalyzer) and titrated with quantitative PCR (qPCR). After denaturation, the libraries were seeded on a flow cell (MiSeq v2, 2×150 bp) at a density of 16 pM. Importantly, sequencing conditions were applied that resulted in in deep sequencing (∼4 Gb of sequence data). Adapters and low-quality sequences were removed (35,36). After verifying the quality of the processed data (FastQC), de novo assembly was performed using software SPAdes (mode careful active; cov-cutoff auto; k-mer sizes 21,33,55,77,99,127; other parameters set as the default parameter) (37,38). PlasmidSPAdes (same parameters as used for the previous assembly) was also used to carry out another complementary assembly to identify the extrachromosomal elements (39). The resulting assemblies were evaluated using Quast to generate summary statistics (no of contigs, total length, GC%, N50, L50) (40). The plasmid was circularized using a dedicated perl script that searches for reads within the original sequencing data that span both ends of a contig (41). For a contig to be considered circular there had to be at least three reads spanning a minimum of 60 bp of each contig end. Final SPAdes assembly was automatically annotated using the PROKKA tool 1.14.5 (42). The annotation of plasmid pBamB1895 was checked manually and names were adapted to the nomenclature used for plasmid pLS20.  Bioinformatic methods  Identification of pLS20-like plasmids in the NCBI database reference genomes  The origin of replication region of pLS20 containing all the information for autonomous DNA replication (i.e. the replication module), spanning bp 64 501 to 65 745 of pLS20cat, accession number AB615352 was used as a query to carried out a BlastN search against the NCBI RefSeq genome database (BlastN algorithm, limited to bacteria (taxid 2)). All sequences with an e-value < 2e-133 and a query cover >50% were retrieved for subsequent analysis. The hits were organized depending on whether they concerned entire plasmid sequences or contigs. The complete sequences of plasmids were aligned using the algorithm directly EMBOSS Stretcher (43) or Nucmer (44). Before aligning, the plasmids were rotated and oriented such that plasmid ended with the first base pair of the alp7A gene. The Nucmer results presented as dot plot graphics in Supplementary Figure S1 were generated using mummerplot software. In the case of contigs, all the sequences belonging to the corresponding NGS project were downloaded to identify plasmid-related contigs. For this, a TblastX search was performed against all the sequences of the NGS project using as a query the sequences of the complete plasmids pLS20, pDSYZ, pBglSRCM103574 and p576. Contigs with an e-value 0.0 were identified as part of the plasmid. Subsequently, the identified contigs were aligned against the closest related query plasmid using the program Mauve (45). Besides confirming that the contig corresponded to a plasmid sequence, this allowed ordering and orienting the contigs, resulting in partially reconstructed plasmids.  Comparative genetic maps and protein analysis  Comparative studies were performed using a set of representative plasmids whose complete or almost complete sequence was known. The representative plasmids were selected based on the phylogenetic relatedness of the plasmids and corresponded to one plasmid of each (sub)clade (see below). The homologous genes of the selected plasmids were initially detected using the tools ‘get_homologues’ or ‘Blast’ (46,47). Initially identified homologies were checked by performing global pairwise alignment to confirm and optimize global alignments between pairs of sequences. The percentages of identity obtained by pairwise alignments were used to determine whether the genes encoding the proteins were considered homologous or not: proteins were considered homologous and not homologous when their identity levels were above 30 and below 15%, respectively. Additional analyses were performed for genes encoding proteins sharing identity levels between 15 and 30% to determine whether these proteins share common features. These analyses included the prediction of (i) transmembrane domains (TMHMM server, http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TMHMM/), (ii) an N-terminal sec-dependent secretion signal (SignalP-5.0 server, http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP/), (iii) coiled coil regions (COILS server, https://embnet.vital-it.ch/software/COILS_form.html) or (iv) any conserved domains or classification to a protein family (InterProScan, www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/services/web/toolform.ebi?tool=iprscan5&sequence). In addition, proteins were screened for similar secondary structure using the Jpred server (www.compbio.dundee.ac.uk/jpred/) or possible structural relationships using the HHPred server (toolkit.tuebingen.mpg.de/tools/hhpred). Genetic maps were generated using the GenomeDiagram module (Biopython, biopython.org) and edited with Inkscape software to manually annotate and represent the homology relationships on the plasmids maps.  Phylogenetic trees  Phylogenetic trees were constructed using IQ-TREE software (48). In all cases, the IQ-TREE software was allowed to determine the substitution model to be used through the ModelFinder module (49), and the ultrafast bootstrap statistical method (1000 replicates) was applied. The root was placed at the midpoint on the unrooted generated trees. The specific conditions, parameters and statistics applied for each tree were as follows.  pLS20 family phylogenetic tree based on the replication module  This tree was constructed from an alignment generated by the MAFFT algorithm (mafft.cbrc.jp/alignment/server/) using the following settings: E-INS-i method, recommended for sequences with multiple conserved domains and long gaps and discarding the gaps. The likelihood tree was made from 35 sequences each having a length of 842 nucleotides. The model selected by ModelFinder was TPM3u + F + G4. The Log-likelihood of the tree was -4201.04.  pLS20 family phylogenetic tree based on conserved CDS of pLS20-like plasmids  This tree was constructed with the help of the get_homologues and get_phylomarkers programs (46,50). Clusters of orthologous genes (COG) detected by the get_homologues program were filtered on a pipeline in order to identify high-quality markers, whose coding DNA sequences were subsequently concatenated and used to elaborate a likelihood tree using IQ-TREE. The get_homologues program was applied using the following parameters: COG algorithm, E-value < 1e-5 and coverage > 60. The settings of the Get_phylomarkers program were as follows. IQ-TREE algorithm, k 1.0, m 0.6, T high and test all DNA models. The resulting tree was based on an alignment of 34 sequences corresponding to a concatenated 5186 long nucleotide sequence. The CDS from which the concatenated sequence of each plasmid was obtained corresponded to genes 24c (alp7A), 25 (rap), 28, 36, 38, 39, 40, 58 (rel) and 60 (according to the nomenclature of plasmid pLS20). The substitution model was GTR+F+ASC+G4. The Log-likelihood of the tree: -48326.87.  Phylogenetic tree of the Rap proteins  The MAFFT algorithm applying the following settings aligned the sequences of the Rap proteins of the seven pLS20-like plasmids analysed in the comparative study. G-INS-i method, recommended for sequences with global homology, and discarding the gaps. The likelihood tree was made from eight sequences with 386 residues. The model selected by ModelFinder was cpREV+F+I+G4. The Log-likelihood of the tree is -5289.94.  The constructed trees were used to determine (sub)clades. For this purpose, the program ‘TreeCluster’ was used, selecting the clustering method, Avg Clade, threshold 0.045 (51). This program allows defining clusters from phylogenetic trees applying the same criterion (chosen algorithm) to all the branches of the tree, which facilitates the interpretation and consistency of the clades/clusters.

A better understanding of the conjugation process is required for developing drugs and strategies to impede the conjugation-mediated spread of these genes. So far, only a limited number of conjugative elements have been studied. For most of them, it is not known whether they represent a group of conjugative elements, nor about their distribution patterns. Here we show that pLS20 from the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis is the prototype conjugative plasmid of a family of at least 35 members that can be divided into four clades, and which are harboured by different Bacillus species found in different global locations and environmental niches. Analyses of their phylogenetic relationship and their conjugation operons have expanded our understanding of a family of conjugative plasmids of Gram-positive origin.  ",FALSE,FALSE,

PMC8557374,CONCLUDING REMARKS,Other,GCA_001029865,0,0,0,?,"Referring to genomes or organisms here?....""harboured by different Bacillus species distributed at very different geographical locations around the world""","  CONCLUDING REMARKS  Here we show that pLS20 constitutes the prototype of a family of related plasmids that are harboured by different Bacillus species distributed at very different geographical locations around the world. Although the plasmids share a conserved structural organization, they could be divided into four clades. Besides a variable region located in between the partition and conjugation modules, all the plasmids contain three conserved modules: a replication, a partitioning and a conjugation module. In addition, plasmids belonging to clades I and IV contain a DNA repair module that is comprised by genes uvrX and yolD, while plasmids belonging to clade II and two of the three clade III plasmids only contain a yolD gene. The very large conjugation module can be divided into two subregions. Except for one, all the other plasmids contain a 5′-located region of three genes that are responsible for controlling the activation of the conjugation pathway. This region is followed by a very large operon encoding all the genes required for the different steps of the conjugation pathway. Remarkably, the sequential steps of the conjugation process are reflected by the order of genes within the conjugation operon. Thus, the first two genes of the conjugation operon constitute a bipartite P-AT system. These two genes are followed by genes involved in the first steps of the conjugation process: selection of and attachment to a recipient cell. The regions downstream are occupied respectively by genes encoding proteins involved in steps two (generation of the T4SS), three (DNA processing) and four (conversion of single-stranded to double-stranded plasmid DNA). Comparative analysis of representative plasmids of the different clades revealed that most of the genes located in the conjugation operons are conserved in all plasmids, indicating that these perform important functions. In addition, some plasmids contain a few or several unique genes that may contribute additional features. The results of the comparative analyses are useful for future studies, not only allowing conserved and unique genes between plasmids of the pLS20 family to be differentiated, and conserved residues or regions within homologous protein to be identified, our analyses also help better understanding of the relationship between the pLS20 family plasmids and other conjugative plasmids of G+ bacteria.

PMC8557374,INTRODUCTION,Introduction,GCA_001029865,1,0,0,,"""The majority of these were not annotated as a plasmid but we reconstructed them from multiple contigs that are present in different next-generation sequencing (NGS) projects. ""","  INTRODUCTION  Many bacteria possess autonomously replicating extrachromosomal DNA molecules named plasmids, which are composed of essential and—most often—one or more modules that are non-essential to the plasmid (1–3). In this work, we define a module as a DNA region containing all the genes and/or genetic information for performing a function or cellular process. One of the modules that is essential for all plasmids concerns a replication module responsible for regulating (initiation of) DNA replication and thereby controlling the plasmid copy number. Most plasmids replicate via the theta or the rolling-circle mechanism. Large low-copy number theta-replicating plasmids contain a segregation module whose encoded proteins ensure faithful partitioning of the plasmid during cell division. A large subset of plasmids is mobile due to the presence of a non-essential module allowing the plasmid to transfer itself horizontally to other cells via conjugation or mobilization (see below). Genes encoding virulence determinants, toxins or antibiotic resistance are often present on conjugative or mobilizable plasmids, and so can efficiently spread, causing major clinical problems and enormous economic consequences worldwide (4,5). A better understanding of the conjugation and mobilization processes is warranted to help develop drugs and strategies impeding the spread of pernicious genes by these transfer routes.  Conjugation modules comprise all the genes required for performing the following steps in the conjugation process. First, selection of and attachment to the recipient cell. Two, generation of a sophisticated translocation channel, a type IV secretion system (T4SS), connecting the donor and the recipient cells. Three, DNA processing generating the DNA form that is transferred, which in most cases is a single DNA-strand (ssDNA), and subsequent transport of the ssDNA strand through the T4SS. Finally, establishment of the transferred DNA in the recipient cell by converting the ssDNA into a double-stranded DNA molecule. Mobilizable plasmids only encode the proteins involved in the DNA processing reaction and exploit the proteins generated by a conjugative plasmid that are necessary for transfer. Because the conjugation process involves many genes, conjugative plasmids are large and use the theta type of replication during growth. Mobilizable plasmids are much smaller and can use the theta or rolling circle mechanism of replication. Conjugative elements can also be embedded in the bacterial chromosome, which are then named integrated and conjugative elements (ICE). Excellent reviews on the process of conjugation have been published elsewhere (6–13).  Conjugation occurs in both Gram-positive (G+) and Gram-negative (G-) bacteria. However, conjugative elements from G+ bacteria are less well studied than those from G− and the available information is based on a very limited number of conjugative plasmids that share little similarity between them. Although these studies have provided important insights, results on conjugation systems will have added relevance and impacts if they concern a prototype plasmid representing a family of related plasmids. For instance, comprehensive analysis of multiple related sequences may discriminate essential from non-essential genes and identify conserved regions or residues within a set of orthologous proteins that may be important for function.  The conjugative plasmid pLS20 (≈65 kb) was originally identified from the Bacillus subtilis natto strain IFO3335 (14). We chose to study pLS20 because it was the only known conjugative B. subtilis plasmid at the time we started, and its replication and partition module had already been identified and characterized (15–17). Contrary to most conjugative systems, pLS20 conjugates efficiently in both solid and liquid media (18–21). Since conjugation in liquid medium is rapid and gives very reproducible results, pLS20 is an attractive system to study conjugation. In the recent years, considerable progress has been made in understanding some aspects of the pLS20 conjugation process, particularly about mating pair formation, regulation of the conjugation genes and the DNA processing reaction (21–29).  Previously, we have shown that the 43 kb plasmid p576 from the Bacillus pumilus strain NRS576 isolated from the USA is related to pLS20 that was isolated from a B. subtilis natto strain in Japan (30–33). This suggested that pLS20 might be the prototype of a family of related plasmids. Here, we show that this is indeed the case. We have identified 35 plasmids in the public databases that are related to pLS20. The majority of these were not annotated as a plasmid but we reconstructed them from multiple contigs that are present in different next-generation sequencing (NGS) projects. All these 35 plasmids are harboured by different Bacillus species, and they could be classified into four clades. The identified plasmids have a conserved organization sharing similar origin, partitioning and conjugation modules, as well as several genes of unknown function. In addition, the majority of these pLS20 family plasmids also contain a DNA repair module. The (dis)similarities between the plasmids are analysed and discussed, providing important information for our understanding of these important and wide spread plasmids, and for future research in conjugation-related studies in general, particularly for those in G+ bacteria.

PMC8557374,MATERIALS AND METHODS,Materials and Methods,GCA_001029865,0,0,0,,This paper doesn't make much sense because the methods section doesn't describe any of the work that's laid out in the results/discussions. There are basically two sets of methods here.,"  MATERIALS AND METHODS  Bacterial strains, plasmids and oligonucleotides  Bacterial strains were grown in Lysogeny Broth (LB) medium (34) or plated on LB plates containing 1.5% agar. When appropriate, the following antibiotics were added: ampicillin (100 μg/ml) for Escherichia coli. The strains, plasmids and oligonucleotides used are listed in Supplementary Tables S1, S2 and S3, respectively. All oligonucleotides were purchased from Isogen Life Science, The Netherlands.  DNA isolation and large plasmid screening  Bacillus strains were grown overnight at 37°C with shaking (180 RPM) in fresh LB medium in a total volume of 12 ml. The next day, 10 ml of the culture was pelleted in 5 Eppendorf tubes of 2 ml and processed as follows. Bacterial pellets were resuspended in 1 ml of Birnboim solution A (20% sucrose, 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.1, 10 mM EDTA and 50 mM NaCl) to which lysozyme was added freshly (2 mg/ml). After freezing the samples at -80°C and subsequent thawing, the tubes were incubated at 37°C with shaking during 15 min. The cells were lysed by adding 33 μl of 1% sarkosyl solution and proteinase K (100 μg/ml) to 1 ml of cell suspension and incubating the mixture at 60°C without shaking during 20 min. Next, the mixture was subjected to a phenol-chloroform extraction step and subsequently precipitated overnight in the presence of 96% ethanol. After washing with 70% ethanol solution, resulting DNA pellets were resuspended in sterile MiliQ water and treated with RNAse A. Finally, DNA samples (1–2 μl) were loaded on a 0.7% agarose gel (1× TBE buffer) without EtBr and run at 30 V for 16 h. Next, gels were stained with a 1xTBE solution containing EtBr for 2 h, followed by a destaining step and finally photographed under ultraviolet light.  Sequencing  Circularization of pBatNRS213  Plasmid pBatNRS213 was circularized as follows. A PCR was performed using total DNA extract of B. atrophaeus strain NRS213 as template DNA in combination with the outward oriented oligos oJV216 and oJV217 that hybridize near the ends of the linear contig corresponding to pBatNRS213 plasmid. The PCR product was digested with SalI and ligated into pBluescript II KS (+) vector linearized with the same restriction enzyme. The ligation mixture was used to transform competent E. coli XL-blue strain, and transformants were selected on LB agar plates supplemented with ampicillin, IPTG (1 mM) and X-gal (60 μg/ml). Some at randomly chosen colonies that had a white colour were analysed by colony PCR for the presence of an insert using oligos M13Fw-21_ext and M13-R. The positively identified derivative was named pJV40. The insert was sequenced by the Sanger method using oligos M13Fw-21_ext and M13-R.  Next-generation sequencing (NGS) of strain B. amyloliquefaciens B1895  A total DNA sample of B. amyloliquefaciens B1895 strain was used for sequence determination using the Illumina MiSeq platform. Preparation of samples and sequencing was done in collaboration with Dr Ricardo Ramos Parque Científico de Madrid (Madrid, Spain). DNA libraries were prepared with the NEBNext DNA library prep kit for Illumina (New England Biolabs). Briefly, 1 μg DNA was sonicated, and fragments of □675 or 1075 bp were selected. DNA ends were repaired, A-tailed and then ligated to adapters. Next, fragments were PCR amplified (8 cycles) and quality checked on a DNA 7500 chip on a 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent). Library sizes of 800 and 1200 bp were isolated, validated (Bioanalyzer) and titrated with quantitative PCR (qPCR). After denaturation, the libraries were seeded on a flow cell (MiSeq v2, 2×150 bp) at a density of 16 pM. Importantly, sequencing conditions were applied that resulted in in deep sequencing (∼4 Gb of sequence data). Adapters and low-quality sequences were removed (35,36). After verifying the quality of the processed data (FastQC), de novo assembly was performed using software SPAdes (mode careful active; cov-cutoff auto; k-mer sizes 21,33,55,77,99,127; other parameters set as the default parameter) (37,38). PlasmidSPAdes (same parameters as used for the previous assembly) was also used to carry out another complementary assembly to identify the extrachromosomal elements (39). The resulting assemblies were evaluated using Quast to generate summary statistics (no of contigs, total length, GC%, N50, L50) (40). The plasmid was circularized using a dedicated perl script that searches for reads within the original sequencing data that span both ends of a contig (41). For a contig to be considered circular there had to be at least three reads spanning a minimum of 60 bp of each contig end. Final SPAdes assembly was automatically annotated using the PROKKA tool 1.14.5 (42). The annotation of plasmid pBamB1895 was checked manually and names were adapted to the nomenclature used for plasmid pLS20.  Bioinformatic methods  Identification of pLS20-like plasmids in the NCBI database reference genomes  The origin of replication region of pLS20 containing all the information for autonomous DNA replication (i.e. the replication module), spanning bp 64 501 to 65 745 of pLS20cat, accession number AB615352 was used as a query to carried out a BlastN search against the NCBI RefSeq genome database (BlastN algorithm, limited to bacteria (taxid 2)). All sequences with an e-value < 2e-133 and a query cover >50% were retrieved for subsequent analysis. The hits were organized depending on whether they concerned entire plasmid sequences or contigs. The complete sequences of plasmids were aligned using the algorithm directly EMBOSS Stretcher (43) or Nucmer (44). Before aligning, the plasmids were rotated and oriented such that plasmid ended with the first base pair of the alp7A gene. The Nucmer results presented as dot plot graphics in Supplementary Figure S1 were generated using mummerplot software. In the case of contigs, all the sequences belonging to the corresponding NGS project were downloaded to identify plasmid-related contigs. For this, a TblastX search was performed against all the sequences of the NGS project using as a query the sequences of the complete plasmids pLS20, pDSYZ, pBglSRCM103574 and p576. Contigs with an e-value 0.0 were identified as part of the plasmid. Subsequently, the identified contigs were aligned against the closest related query plasmid using the program Mauve (45). Besides confirming that the contig corresponded to a plasmid sequence, this allowed ordering and orienting the contigs, resulting in partially reconstructed plasmids.  Comparative genetic maps and protein analysis  Comparative studies were performed using a set of representative plasmids whose complete or almost complete sequence was known. The representative plasmids were selected based on the phylogenetic relatedness of the plasmids and corresponded to one plasmid of each (sub)clade (see below). The homologous genes of the selected plasmids were initially detected using the tools ‘get_homologues’ or ‘Blast’ (46,47). Initially identified homologies were checked by performing global pairwise alignment to confirm and optimize global alignments between pairs of sequences. The percentages of identity obtained by pairwise alignments were used to determine whether the genes encoding the proteins were considered homologous or not: proteins were considered homologous and not homologous when their identity levels were above 30 and below 15%, respectively. Additional analyses were performed for genes encoding proteins sharing identity levels between 15 and 30% to determine whether these proteins share common features. These analyses included the prediction of (i) transmembrane domains (TMHMM server, http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TMHMM/), (ii) an N-terminal sec-dependent secretion signal (SignalP-5.0 server, http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP/), (iii) coiled coil regions (COILS server, https://embnet.vital-it.ch/software/COILS_form.html) or (iv) any conserved domains or classification to a protein family (InterProScan, www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/services/web/toolform.ebi?tool=iprscan5&sequence). In addition, proteins were screened for similar secondary structure using the Jpred server (www.compbio.dundee.ac.uk/jpred/) or possible structural relationships using the HHPred server (toolkit.tuebingen.mpg.de/tools/hhpred). Genetic maps were generated using the GenomeDiagram module (Biopython, biopython.org) and edited with Inkscape software to manually annotate and represent the homology relationships on the plasmids maps.  Phylogenetic trees  Phylogenetic trees were constructed using IQ-TREE software (48). In all cases, the IQ-TREE software was allowed to determine the substitution model to be used through the ModelFinder module (49), and the ultrafast bootstrap statistical method (1000 replicates) was applied. The root was placed at the midpoint on the unrooted generated trees. The specific conditions, parameters and statistics applied for each tree were as follows.  pLS20 family phylogenetic tree based on the replication module  This tree was constructed from an alignment generated by the MAFFT algorithm (mafft.cbrc.jp/alignment/server/) using the following settings: E-INS-i method, recommended for sequences with multiple conserved domains and long gaps and discarding the gaps. The likelihood tree was made from 35 sequences each having a length of 842 nucleotides. The model selected by ModelFinder was TPM3u + F + G4. The Log-likelihood of the tree was -4201.04.  pLS20 family phylogenetic tree based on conserved CDS of pLS20-like plasmids  This tree was constructed with the help of the get_homologues and get_phylomarkers programs (46,50). Clusters of orthologous genes (COG) detected by the get_homologues program were filtered on a pipeline in order to identify high-quality markers, whose coding DNA sequences were subsequently concatenated and used to elaborate a likelihood tree using IQ-TREE. The get_homologues program was applied using the following parameters: COG algorithm, E-value < 1e-5 and coverage > 60. The settings of the Get_phylomarkers program were as follows. IQ-TREE algorithm, k 1.0, m 0.6, T high and test all DNA models. The resulting tree was based on an alignment of 34 sequences corresponding to a concatenated 5186 long nucleotide sequence. The CDS from which the concatenated sequence of each plasmid was obtained corresponded to genes 24c (alp7A), 25 (rap), 28, 36, 38, 39, 40, 58 (rel) and 60 (according to the nomenclature of plasmid pLS20). The substitution model was GTR+F+ASC+G4. The Log-likelihood of the tree: -48326.87.  Phylogenetic tree of the Rap proteins  The MAFFT algorithm applying the following settings aligned the sequences of the Rap proteins of the seven pLS20-like plasmids analysed in the comparative study. G-INS-i method, recommended for sequences with global homology, and discarding the gaps. The likelihood tree was made from eight sequences with 386 residues. The model selected by ModelFinder was cpREV+F+I+G4. The Log-likelihood of the tree is -5289.94.  The constructed trees were used to determine (sub)clades. For this purpose, the program ‘TreeCluster’ was used, selecting the clustering method, Avg Clade, threshold 0.045 (51). This program allows defining clusters from phylogenetic trees applying the same criterion (chosen algorithm) to all the branches of the tree, which facilitates the interpretation and consistency of the clades/clusters.

PMC8557374,Abstract,Abstract,GCA_001286745,0,0,0,,,"  Abstract  Conjugation plays important roles in genome plasticity, adaptation and evolution but is also the major horizontal gene-transfer route responsible for spreading toxin, virulence and antibiotic resistance genes. A better understanding of the conjugation process is required for developing drugs and strategies to impede the conjugation-mediated spread of these genes. So far, only a limited number of conjugative elements have been studied. For most of them, it is not known whether they represent a group of conjugative elements, nor about their distribution patterns. Here we show that pLS20 from the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis is the prototype conjugative plasmid of a family of at least 35 members that can be divided into four clades, and which are harboured by different Bacillus species found in different global locations and environmental niches. Analyses of their phylogenetic relationship and their conjugation operons have expanded our understanding of a family of conjugative plasmids of Gram-positive origin.  ",FALSE,FALSE,

PMC8557374,CONCLUDING REMARKS,Other,GCA_001286745,0,0,0,?,,"  CONCLUDING REMARKS  Here we show that pLS20 constitutes the prototype of a family of related plasmids that are harboured by different Bacillus species distributed at very different geographical locations around the world. Although the plasmids share a conserved structural organization, they could be divided into four clades. Besides a variable region located in between the partition and conjugation modules, all the plasmids contain three conserved modules: a replication, a partitioning and a conjugation module. In addition, plasmids belonging to clades I and IV contain a DNA repair module that is comprised by genes uvrX and yolD, while plasmids belonging to clade II and two of the three clade III plasmids only contain a yolD gene. The very large conjugation module can be divided into two subregions. Except for one, all the other plasmids contain a 5′-located region of three genes that are responsible for controlling the activation of the conjugation pathway. This region is followed by a very large operon encoding all the genes required for the different steps of the conjugation pathway. Remarkably, the sequential steps of the conjugation process are reflected by the order of genes within the conjugation operon. Thus, the first two genes of the conjugation operon constitute a bipartite P-AT system. These two genes are followed by genes involved in the first steps of the conjugation process: selection of and attachment to a recipient cell. The regions downstream are occupied respectively by genes encoding proteins involved in steps two (generation of the T4SS), three (DNA processing) and four (conversion of single-stranded to double-stranded plasmid DNA). Comparative analysis of representative plasmids of the different clades revealed that most of the genes located in the conjugation operons are conserved in all plasmids, indicating that these perform important functions. In addition, some plasmids contain a few or several unique genes that may contribute additional features. The results of the comparative analyses are useful for future studies, not only allowing conserved and unique genes between plasmids of the pLS20 family to be differentiated, and conserved residues or regions within homologous protein to be identified, our analyses also help better understanding of the relationship between the pLS20 family plasmids and other conjugative plasmids of G+ bacteria.

PMC8557374,INTRODUCTION,Introduction,GCA_001286745,1,0,0,,,"  INTRODUCTION  Many bacteria possess autonomously replicating extrachromosomal DNA molecules named plasmids, which are composed of essential and—most often—one or more modules that are non-essential to the plasmid (1–3). In this work, we define a module as a DNA region containing all the genes and/or genetic information for performing a function or cellular process. One of the modules that is essential for all plasmids concerns a replication module responsible for regulating (initiation of) DNA replication and thereby controlling the plasmid copy number. Most plasmids replicate via the theta or the rolling-circle mechanism. Large low-copy number theta-replicating plasmids contain a segregation module whose encoded proteins ensure faithful partitioning of the plasmid during cell division. A large subset of plasmids is mobile due to the presence of a non-essential module allowing the plasmid to transfer itself horizontally to other cells via conjugation or mobilization (see below). Genes encoding virulence determinants, toxins or antibiotic resistance are often present on conjugative or mobilizable plasmids, and so can efficiently spread, causing major clinical problems and enormous economic consequences worldwide (4,5). A better understanding of the conjugation and mobilization processes is warranted to help develop drugs and strategies impeding the spread of pernicious genes by these transfer routes.  Conjugation modules comprise all the genes required for performing the following steps in the conjugation process. First, selection of and attachment to the recipient cell. Two, generation of a sophisticated translocation channel, a type IV secretion system (T4SS), connecting the donor and the recipient cells. Three, DNA processing generating the DNA form that is transferred, which in most cases is a single DNA-strand (ssDNA), and subsequent transport of the ssDNA strand through the T4SS. Finally, establishment of the transferred DNA in the recipient cell by converting the ssDNA into a double-stranded DNA molecule. Mobilizable plasmids only encode the proteins involved in the DNA processing reaction and exploit the proteins generated by a conjugative plasmid that are necessary for transfer. Because the conjugation process involves many genes, conjugative plasmids are large and use the theta type of replication during growth. Mobilizable plasmids are much smaller and can use the theta or rolling circle mechanism of replication. Conjugative elements can also be embedded in the bacterial chromosome, which are then named integrated and conjugative elements (ICE). Excellent reviews on the process of conjugation have been published elsewhere (6–13).  Conjugation occurs in both Gram-positive (G+) and Gram-negative (G-) bacteria. However, conjugative elements from G+ bacteria are less well studied than those from G− and the available information is based on a very limited number of conjugative plasmids that share little similarity between them. Although these studies have provided important insights, results on conjugation systems will have added relevance and impacts if they concern a prototype plasmid representing a family of related plasmids. For instance, comprehensive analysis of multiple related sequences may discriminate essential from non-essential genes and identify conserved regions or residues within a set of orthologous proteins that may be important for function.  The conjugative plasmid pLS20 (≈65 kb) was originally identified from the Bacillus subtilis natto strain IFO3335 (14). We chose to study pLS20 because it was the only known conjugative B. subtilis plasmid at the time we started, and its replication and partition module had already been identified and characterized (15–17). Contrary to most conjugative systems, pLS20 conjugates efficiently in both solid and liquid media (18–21). Since conjugation in liquid medium is rapid and gives very reproducible results, pLS20 is an attractive system to study conjugation. In the recent years, considerable progress has been made in understanding some aspects of the pLS20 conjugation process, particularly about mating pair formation, regulation of the conjugation genes and the DNA processing reaction (21–29).  Previously, we have shown that the 43 kb plasmid p576 from the Bacillus pumilus strain NRS576 isolated from the USA is related to pLS20 that was isolated from a B. subtilis natto strain in Japan (30–33). This suggested that pLS20 might be the prototype of a family of related plasmids. Here, we show that this is indeed the case. We have identified 35 plasmids in the public databases that are related to pLS20. The majority of these were not annotated as a plasmid but we reconstructed them from multiple contigs that are present in different next-generation sequencing (NGS) projects. All these 35 plasmids are harboured by different Bacillus species, and they could be classified into four clades. The identified plasmids have a conserved organization sharing similar origin, partitioning and conjugation modules, as well as several genes of unknown function. In addition, the majority of these pLS20 family plasmids also contain a DNA repair module. The (dis)similarities between the plasmids are analysed and discussed, providing important information for our understanding of these important and wide spread plasmids, and for future research in conjugation-related studies in general, particularly for those in G+ bacteria.

PMC8557374,MATERIALS AND METHODS,Materials and Methods,GCA_001286745,0,0,0,,,"  MATERIALS AND METHODS  Bacterial strains, plasmids and oligonucleotides  Bacterial strains were grown in Lysogeny Broth (LB) medium (34) or plated on LB plates containing 1.5% agar. When appropriate, the following antibiotics were added: ampicillin (100 μg/ml) for Escherichia coli. The strains, plasmids and oligonucleotides used are listed in Supplementary Tables S1, S2 and S3, respectively. All oligonucleotides were purchased from Isogen Life Science, The Netherlands.  DNA isolation and large plasmid screening  Bacillus strains were grown overnight at 37°C with shaking (180 RPM) in fresh LB medium in a total volume of 12 ml. The next day, 10 ml of the culture was pelleted in 5 Eppendorf tubes of 2 ml and processed as follows. Bacterial pellets were resuspended in 1 ml of Birnboim solution A (20% sucrose, 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.1, 10 mM EDTA and 50 mM NaCl) to which lysozyme was added freshly (2 mg/ml). After freezing the samples at -80°C and subsequent thawing, the tubes were incubated at 37°C with shaking during 15 min. The cells were lysed by adding 33 μl of 1% sarkosyl solution and proteinase K (100 μg/ml) to 1 ml of cell suspension and incubating the mixture at 60°C without shaking during 20 min. Next, the mixture was subjected to a phenol-chloroform extraction step and subsequently precipitated overnight in the presence of 96% ethanol. After washing with 70% ethanol solution, resulting DNA pellets were resuspended in sterile MiliQ water and treated with RNAse A. Finally, DNA samples (1–2 μl) were loaded on a 0.7% agarose gel (1× TBE buffer) without EtBr and run at 30 V for 16 h. Next, gels were stained with a 1xTBE solution containing EtBr for 2 h, followed by a destaining step and finally photographed under ultraviolet light.  Sequencing  Circularization of pBatNRS213  Plasmid pBatNRS213 was circularized as follows. A PCR was performed using total DNA extract of B. atrophaeus strain NRS213 as template DNA in combination with the outward oriented oligos oJV216 and oJV217 that hybridize near the ends of the linear contig corresponding to pBatNRS213 plasmid. The PCR product was digested with SalI and ligated into pBluescript II KS (+) vector linearized with the same restriction enzyme. The ligation mixture was used to transform competent E. coli XL-blue strain, and transformants were selected on LB agar plates supplemented with ampicillin, IPTG (1 mM) and X-gal (60 μg/ml). Some at randomly chosen colonies that had a white colour were analysed by colony PCR for the presence of an insert using oligos M13Fw-21_ext and M13-R. The positively identified derivative was named pJV40. The insert was sequenced by the Sanger method using oligos M13Fw-21_ext and M13-R.  Next-generation sequencing (NGS) of strain B. amyloliquefaciens B1895  A total DNA sample of B. amyloliquefaciens B1895 strain was used for sequence determination using the Illumina MiSeq platform. Preparation of samples and sequencing was done in collaboration with Dr Ricardo Ramos Parque Científico de Madrid (Madrid, Spain). DNA libraries were prepared with the NEBNext DNA library prep kit for Illumina (New England Biolabs). Briefly, 1 μg DNA was sonicated, and fragments of □675 or 1075 bp were selected. DNA ends were repaired, A-tailed and then ligated to adapters. Next, fragments were PCR amplified (8 cycles) and quality checked on a DNA 7500 chip on a 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent). Library sizes of 800 and 1200 bp were isolated, validated (Bioanalyzer) and titrated with quantitative PCR (qPCR). After denaturation, the libraries were seeded on a flow cell (MiSeq v2, 2×150 bp) at a density of 16 pM. Importantly, sequencing conditions were applied that resulted in in deep sequencing (∼4 Gb of sequence data). Adapters and low-quality sequences were removed (35,36). After verifying the quality of the processed data (FastQC), de novo assembly was performed using software SPAdes (mode careful active; cov-cutoff auto; k-mer sizes 21,33,55,77,99,127; other parameters set as the default parameter) (37,38). PlasmidSPAdes (same parameters as used for the previous assembly) was also used to carry out another complementary assembly to identify the extrachromosomal elements (39). The resulting assemblies were evaluated using Quast to generate summary statistics (no of contigs, total length, GC%, N50, L50) (40). The plasmid was circularized using a dedicated perl script that searches for reads within the original sequencing data that span both ends of a contig (41). For a contig to be considered circular there had to be at least three reads spanning a minimum of 60 bp of each contig end. Final SPAdes assembly was automatically annotated using the PROKKA tool 1.14.5 (42). The annotation of plasmid pBamB1895 was checked manually and names were adapted to the nomenclature used for plasmid pLS20.  Bioinformatic methods  Identification of pLS20-like plasmids in the NCBI database reference genomes  The origin of replication region of pLS20 containing all the information for autonomous DNA replication (i.e. the replication module), spanning bp 64 501 to 65 745 of pLS20cat, accession number AB615352 was used as a query to carried out a BlastN search against the NCBI RefSeq genome database (BlastN algorithm, limited to bacteria (taxid 2)). All sequences with an e-value < 2e-133 and a query cover >50% were retrieved for subsequent analysis. The hits were organized depending on whether they concerned entire plasmid sequences or contigs. The complete sequences of plasmids were aligned using the algorithm directly EMBOSS Stretcher (43) or Nucmer (44). Before aligning, the plasmids were rotated and oriented such that plasmid ended with the first base pair of the alp7A gene. The Nucmer results presented as dot plot graphics in Supplementary Figure S1 were generated using mummerplot software. In the case of contigs, all the sequences belonging to the corresponding NGS project were downloaded to identify plasmid-related contigs. For this, a TblastX search was performed against all the sequences of the NGS project using as a query the sequences of the complete plasmids pLS20, pDSYZ, pBglSRCM103574 and p576. Contigs with an e-value 0.0 were identified as part of the plasmid. Subsequently, the identified contigs were aligned against the closest related query plasmid using the program Mauve (45). Besides confirming that the contig corresponded to a plasmid sequence, this allowed ordering and orienting the contigs, resulting in partially reconstructed plasmids.  Comparative genetic maps and protein analysis  Comparative studies were performed using a set of representative plasmids whose complete or almost complete sequence was known. The representative plasmids were selected based on the phylogenetic relatedness of the plasmids and corresponded to one plasmid of each (sub)clade (see below). The homologous genes of the selected plasmids were initially detected using the tools ‘get_homologues’ or ‘Blast’ (46,47). Initially identified homologies were checked by performing global pairwise alignment to confirm and optimize global alignments between pairs of sequences. The percentages of identity obtained by pairwise alignments were used to determine whether the genes encoding the proteins were considered homologous or not: proteins were considered homologous and not homologous when their identity levels were above 30 and below 15%, respectively. Additional analyses were performed for genes encoding proteins sharing identity levels between 15 and 30% to determine whether these proteins share common features. These analyses included the prediction of (i) transmembrane domains (TMHMM server, http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TMHMM/), (ii) an N-terminal sec-dependent secretion signal (SignalP-5.0 server, http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP/), (iii) coiled coil regions (COILS server, https://embnet.vital-it.ch/software/COILS_form.html) or (iv) any conserved domains or classification to a protein family (InterProScan, www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/services/web/toolform.ebi?tool=iprscan5&sequence). In addition, proteins were screened for similar secondary structure using the Jpred server (www.compbio.dundee.ac.uk/jpred/) or possible structural relationships using the HHPred server (toolkit.tuebingen.mpg.de/tools/hhpred). Genetic maps were generated using the GenomeDiagram module (Biopython, biopython.org) and edited with Inkscape software to manually annotate and represent the homology relationships on the plasmids maps.  Phylogenetic trees  Phylogenetic trees were constructed using IQ-TREE software (48). In all cases, the IQ-TREE software was allowed to determine the substitution model to be used through the ModelFinder module (49), and the ultrafast bootstrap statistical method (1000 replicates) was applied. The root was placed at the midpoint on the unrooted generated trees. The specific conditions, parameters and statistics applied for each tree were as follows.  pLS20 family phylogenetic tree based on the replication module  This tree was constructed from an alignment generated by the MAFFT algorithm (mafft.cbrc.jp/alignment/server/) using the following settings: E-INS-i method, recommended for sequences with multiple conserved domains and long gaps and discarding the gaps. The likelihood tree was made from 35 sequences each having a length of 842 nucleotides. The model selected by ModelFinder was TPM3u + F + G4. The Log-likelihood of the tree was -4201.04.  pLS20 family phylogenetic tree based on conserved CDS of pLS20-like plasmids  This tree was constructed with the help of the get_homologues and get_phylomarkers programs (46,50). Clusters of orthologous genes (COG) detected by the get_homologues program were filtered on a pipeline in order to identify high-quality markers, whose coding DNA sequences were subsequently concatenated and used to elaborate a likelihood tree using IQ-TREE. The get_homologues program was applied using the following parameters: COG algorithm, E-value < 1e-5 and coverage > 60. The settings of the Get_phylomarkers program were as follows. IQ-TREE algorithm, k 1.0, m 0.6, T high and test all DNA models. The resulting tree was based on an alignment of 34 sequences corresponding to a concatenated 5186 long nucleotide sequence. The CDS from which the concatenated sequence of each plasmid was obtained corresponded to genes 24c (alp7A), 25 (rap), 28, 36, 38, 39, 40, 58 (rel) and 60 (according to the nomenclature of plasmid pLS20). The substitution model was GTR+F+ASC+G4. The Log-likelihood of the tree: -48326.87.  Phylogenetic tree of the Rap proteins  The MAFFT algorithm applying the following settings aligned the sequences of the Rap proteins of the seven pLS20-like plasmids analysed in the comparative study. G-INS-i method, recommended for sequences with global homology, and discarding the gaps. The likelihood tree was made from eight sequences with 386 residues. The model selected by ModelFinder was cpREV+F+I+G4. The Log-likelihood of the tree is -5289.94.  The constructed trees were used to determine (sub)clades. For this purpose, the program ‘TreeCluster’ was used, selecting the clustering method, Avg Clade, threshold 0.045 (51). This program allows defining clusters from phylogenetic trees applying the same criterion (chosen algorithm) to all the branches of the tree, which facilitates the interpretation and consistency of the clades/clusters.

PMC8557374,Abstract,Abstract,GCA_001286845,0,0,0,,,"  Abstract  Conjugation plays important roles in genome plasticity, adaptation and evolution but is also the major horizontal gene-transfer route responsible for spreading toxin, virulence and antibiotic resistance genes. A better understanding of the conjugation process is required for developing drugs and strategies to impede the conjugation-mediated spread of these genes. So far, only a limited number of conjugative elements have been studied. For most of them, it is not known whether they represent a group of conjugative elements, nor about their distribution patterns. Here we show that pLS20 from the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis is the prototype conjugative plasmid of a family of at least 35 members that can be divided into four clades, and which are harboured by different Bacillus species found in different global locations and environmental niches. Analyses of their phylogenetic relationship and their conjugation operons have expanded our understanding of a family of conjugative plasmids of Gram-positive origin.  ",FALSE,FALSE,

PMC8557374,CONCLUDING REMARKS,Other,GCA_001286845,0,0,0,?,,"  CONCLUDING REMARKS  Here we show that pLS20 constitutes the prototype of a family of related plasmids that are harboured by different Bacillus species distributed at very different geographical locations around the world. Although the plasmids share a conserved structural organization, they could be divided into four clades. Besides a variable region located in between the partition and conjugation modules, all the plasmids contain three conserved modules: a replication, a partitioning and a conjugation module. In addition, plasmids belonging to clades I and IV contain a DNA repair module that is comprised by genes uvrX and yolD, while plasmids belonging to clade II and two of the three clade III plasmids only contain a yolD gene. The very large conjugation module can be divided into two subregions. Except for one, all the other plasmids contain a 5′-located region of three genes that are responsible for controlling the activation of the conjugation pathway. This region is followed by a very large operon encoding all the genes required for the different steps of the conjugation pathway. Remarkably, the sequential steps of the conjugation process are reflected by the order of genes within the conjugation operon. Thus, the first two genes of the conjugation operon constitute a bipartite P-AT system. These two genes are followed by genes involved in the first steps of the conjugation process: selection of and attachment to a recipient cell. The regions downstream are occupied respectively by genes encoding proteins involved in steps two (generation of the T4SS), three (DNA processing) and four (conversion of single-stranded to double-stranded plasmid DNA). Comparative analysis of representative plasmids of the different clades revealed that most of the genes located in the conjugation operons are conserved in all plasmids, indicating that these perform important functions. In addition, some plasmids contain a few or several unique genes that may contribute additional features. The results of the comparative analyses are useful for future studies, not only allowing conserved and unique genes between plasmids of the pLS20 family to be differentiated, and conserved residues or regions within homologous protein to be identified, our analyses also help better understanding of the relationship between the pLS20 family plasmids and other conjugative plasmids of G+ bacteria.

PMC8557374,INTRODUCTION,Introduction,GCA_001286845,1,0,0,,,"  INTRODUCTION  Many bacteria possess autonomously replicating extrachromosomal DNA molecules named plasmids, which are composed of essential and—most often—one or more modules that are non-essential to the plasmid (1–3). In this work, we define a module as a DNA region containing all the genes and/or genetic information for performing a function or cellular process. One of the modules that is essential for all plasmids concerns a replication module responsible for regulating (initiation of) DNA replication and thereby controlling the plasmid copy number. Most plasmids replicate via the theta or the rolling-circle mechanism. Large low-copy number theta-replicating plasmids contain a segregation module whose encoded proteins ensure faithful partitioning of the plasmid during cell division. A large subset of plasmids is mobile due to the presence of a non-essential module allowing the plasmid to transfer itself horizontally to other cells via conjugation or mobilization (see below). Genes encoding virulence determinants, toxins or antibiotic resistance are often present on conjugative or mobilizable plasmids, and so can efficiently spread, causing major clinical problems and enormous economic consequences worldwide (4,5). A better understanding of the conjugation and mobilization processes is warranted to help develop drugs and strategies impeding the spread of pernicious genes by these transfer routes.  Conjugation modules comprise all the genes required for performing the following steps in the conjugation process. First, selection of and attachment to the recipient cell. Two, generation of a sophisticated translocation channel, a type IV secretion system (T4SS), connecting the donor and the recipient cells. Three, DNA processing generating the DNA form that is transferred, which in most cases is a single DNA-strand (ssDNA), and subsequent transport of the ssDNA strand through the T4SS. Finally, establishment of the transferred DNA in the recipient cell by converting the ssDNA into a double-stranded DNA molecule. Mobilizable plasmids only encode the proteins involved in the DNA processing reaction and exploit the proteins generated by a conjugative plasmid that are necessary for transfer. Because the conjugation process involves many genes, conjugative plasmids are large and use the theta type of replication during growth. Mobilizable plasmids are much smaller and can use the theta or rolling circle mechanism of replication. Conjugative elements can also be embedded in the bacterial chromosome, which are then named integrated and conjugative elements (ICE). Excellent reviews on the process of conjugation have been published elsewhere (6–13).  Conjugation occurs in both Gram-positive (G+) and Gram-negative (G-) bacteria. However, conjugative elements from G+ bacteria are less well studied than those from G− and the available information is based on a very limited number of conjugative plasmids that share little similarity between them. Although these studies have provided important insights, results on conjugation systems will have added relevance and impacts if they concern a prototype plasmid representing a family of related plasmids. For instance, comprehensive analysis of multiple related sequences may discriminate essential from non-essential genes and identify conserved regions or residues within a set of orthologous proteins that may be important for function.  The conjugative plasmid pLS20 (≈65 kb) was originally identified from the Bacillus subtilis natto strain IFO3335 (14). We chose to study pLS20 because it was the only known conjugative B. subtilis plasmid at the time we started, and its replication and partition module had already been identified and characterized (15–17). Contrary to most conjugative systems, pLS20 conjugates efficiently in both solid and liquid media (18–21). Since conjugation in liquid medium is rapid and gives very reproducible results, pLS20 is an attractive system to study conjugation. In the recent years, considerable progress has been made in understanding some aspects of the pLS20 conjugation process, particularly about mating pair formation, regulation of the conjugation genes and the DNA processing reaction (21–29).  Previously, we have shown that the 43 kb plasmid p576 from the Bacillus pumilus strain NRS576 isolated from the USA is related to pLS20 that was isolated from a B. subtilis natto strain in Japan (30–33). This suggested that pLS20 might be the prototype of a family of related plasmids. Here, we show that this is indeed the case. We have identified 35 plasmids in the public databases that are related to pLS20. The majority of these were not annotated as a plasmid but we reconstructed them from multiple contigs that are present in different next-generation sequencing (NGS) projects. All these 35 plasmids are harboured by different Bacillus species, and they could be classified into four clades. The identified plasmids have a conserved organization sharing similar origin, partitioning and conjugation modules, as well as several genes of unknown function. In addition, the majority of these pLS20 family plasmids also contain a DNA repair module. The (dis)similarities between the plasmids are analysed and discussed, providing important information for our understanding of these important and wide spread plasmids, and for future research in conjugation-related studies in general, particularly for those in G+ bacteria.

PMC8557374,MATERIALS AND METHODS,Materials and Methods,GCA_001286845,0,0,0,,,"  MATERIALS AND METHODS  Bacterial strains, plasmids and oligonucleotides  Bacterial strains were grown in Lysogeny Broth (LB) medium (34) or plated on LB plates containing 1.5% agar. When appropriate, the following antibiotics were added: ampicillin (100 μg/ml) for Escherichia coli. The strains, plasmids and oligonucleotides used are listed in Supplementary Tables S1, S2 and S3, respectively. All oligonucleotides were purchased from Isogen Life Science, The Netherlands.  DNA isolation and large plasmid screening  Bacillus strains were grown overnight at 37°C with shaking (180 RPM) in fresh LB medium in a total volume of 12 ml. The next day, 10 ml of the culture was pelleted in 5 Eppendorf tubes of 2 ml and processed as follows. Bacterial pellets were resuspended in 1 ml of Birnboim solution A (20% sucrose, 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.1, 10 mM EDTA and 50 mM NaCl) to which lysozyme was added freshly (2 mg/ml). After freezing the samples at -80°C and subsequent thawing, the tubes were incubated at 37°C with shaking during 15 min. The cells were lysed by adding 33 μl of 1% sarkosyl solution and proteinase K (100 μg/ml) to 1 ml of cell suspension and incubating the mixture at 60°C without shaking during 20 min. Next, the mixture was subjected to a phenol-chloroform extraction step and subsequently precipitated overnight in the presence of 96% ethanol. After washing with 70% ethanol solution, resulting DNA pellets were resuspended in sterile MiliQ water and treated with RNAse A. Finally, DNA samples (1–2 μl) were loaded on a 0.7% agarose gel (1× TBE buffer) without EtBr and run at 30 V for 16 h. Next, gels were stained with a 1xTBE solution containing EtBr for 2 h, followed by a destaining step and finally photographed under ultraviolet light.  Sequencing  Circularization of pBatNRS213  Plasmid pBatNRS213 was circularized as follows. A PCR was performed using total DNA extract of B. atrophaeus strain NRS213 as template DNA in combination with the outward oriented oligos oJV216 and oJV217 that hybridize near the ends of the linear contig corresponding to pBatNRS213 plasmid. The PCR product was digested with SalI and ligated into pBluescript II KS (+) vector linearized with the same restriction enzyme. The ligation mixture was used to transform competent E. coli XL-blue strain, and transformants were selected on LB agar plates supplemented with ampicillin, IPTG (1 mM) and X-gal (60 μg/ml). Some at randomly chosen colonies that had a white colour were analysed by colony PCR for the presence of an insert using oligos M13Fw-21_ext and M13-R. The positively identified derivative was named pJV40. The insert was sequenced by the Sanger method using oligos M13Fw-21_ext and M13-R.  Next-generation sequencing (NGS) of strain B. amyloliquefaciens B1895  A total DNA sample of B. amyloliquefaciens B1895 strain was used for sequence determination using the Illumina MiSeq platform. Preparation of samples and sequencing was done in collaboration with Dr Ricardo Ramos Parque Científico de Madrid (Madrid, Spain). DNA libraries were prepared with the NEBNext DNA library prep kit for Illumina (New England Biolabs). Briefly, 1 μg DNA was sonicated, and fragments of □675 or 1075 bp were selected. DNA ends were repaired, A-tailed and then ligated to adapters. Next, fragments were PCR amplified (8 cycles) and quality checked on a DNA 7500 chip on a 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent). Library sizes of 800 and 1200 bp were isolated, validated (Bioanalyzer) and titrated with quantitative PCR (qPCR). After denaturation, the libraries were seeded on a flow cell (MiSeq v2, 2×150 bp) at a density of 16 pM. Importantly, sequencing conditions were applied that resulted in in deep sequencing (∼4 Gb of sequence data). Adapters and low-quality sequences were removed (35,36). After verifying the quality of the processed data (FastQC), de novo assembly was performed using software SPAdes (mode careful active; cov-cutoff auto; k-mer sizes 21,33,55,77,99,127; other parameters set as the default parameter) (37,38). PlasmidSPAdes (same parameters as used for the previous assembly) was also used to carry out another complementary assembly to identify the extrachromosomal elements (39). The resulting assemblies were evaluated using Quast to generate summary statistics (no of contigs, total length, GC%, N50, L50) (40). The plasmid was circularized using a dedicated perl script that searches for reads within the original sequencing data that span both ends of a contig (41). For a contig to be considered circular there had to be at least three reads spanning a minimum of 60 bp of each contig end. Final SPAdes assembly was automatically annotated using the PROKKA tool 1.14.5 (42). The annotation of plasmid pBamB1895 was checked manually and names were adapted to the nomenclature used for plasmid pLS20.  Bioinformatic methods  Identification of pLS20-like plasmids in the NCBI database reference genomes  The origin of replication region of pLS20 containing all the information for autonomous DNA replication (i.e. the replication module), spanning bp 64 501 to 65 745 of pLS20cat, accession number AB615352 was used as a query to carried out a BlastN search against the NCBI RefSeq genome database (BlastN algorithm, limited to bacteria (taxid 2)). All sequences with an e-value < 2e-133 and a query cover >50% were retrieved for subsequent analysis. The hits were organized depending on whether they concerned entire plasmid sequences or contigs. The complete sequences of plasmids were aligned using the algorithm directly EMBOSS Stretcher (43) or Nucmer (44). Before aligning, the plasmids were rotated and oriented such that plasmid ended with the first base pair of the alp7A gene. The Nucmer results presented as dot plot graphics in Supplementary Figure S1 were generated using mummerplot software. In the case of contigs, all the sequences belonging to the corresponding NGS project were downloaded to identify plasmid-related contigs. For this, a TblastX search was performed against all the sequences of the NGS project using as a query the sequences of the complete plasmids pLS20, pDSYZ, pBglSRCM103574 and p576. Contigs with an e-value 0.0 were identified as part of the plasmid. Subsequently, the identified contigs were aligned against the closest related query plasmid using the program Mauve (45). Besides confirming that the contig corresponded to a plasmid sequence, this allowed ordering and orienting the contigs, resulting in partially reconstructed plasmids.  Comparative genetic maps and protein analysis  Comparative studies were performed using a set of representative plasmids whose complete or almost complete sequence was known. The representative plasmids were selected based on the phylogenetic relatedness of the plasmids and corresponded to one plasmid of each (sub)clade (see below). The homologous genes of the selected plasmids were initially detected using the tools ‘get_homologues’ or ‘Blast’ (46,47). Initially identified homologies were checked by performing global pairwise alignment to confirm and optimize global alignments between pairs of sequences. The percentages of identity obtained by pairwise alignments were used to determine whether the genes encoding the proteins were considered homologous or not: proteins were considered homologous and not homologous when their identity levels were above 30 and below 15%, respectively. Additional analyses were performed for genes encoding proteins sharing identity levels between 15 and 30% to determine whether these proteins share common features. These analyses included the prediction of (i) transmembrane domains (TMHMM server, http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TMHMM/), (ii) an N-terminal sec-dependent secretion signal (SignalP-5.0 server, http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP/), (iii) coiled coil regions (COILS server, https://embnet.vital-it.ch/software/COILS_form.html) or (iv) any conserved domains or classification to a protein family (InterProScan, www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/services/web/toolform.ebi?tool=iprscan5&sequence). In addition, proteins were screened for similar secondary structure using the Jpred server (www.compbio.dundee.ac.uk/jpred/) or possible structural relationships using the HHPred server (toolkit.tuebingen.mpg.de/tools/hhpred). Genetic maps were generated using the GenomeDiagram module (Biopython, biopython.org) and edited with Inkscape software to manually annotate and represent the homology relationships on the plasmids maps.  Phylogenetic trees  Phylogenetic trees were constructed using IQ-TREE software (48). In all cases, the IQ-TREE software was allowed to determine the substitution model to be used through the ModelFinder module (49), and the ultrafast bootstrap statistical method (1000 replicates) was applied. The root was placed at the midpoint on the unrooted generated trees. The specific conditions, parameters and statistics applied for each tree were as follows.  pLS20 family phylogenetic tree based on the replication module  This tree was constructed from an alignment generated by the MAFFT algorithm (mafft.cbrc.jp/alignment/server/) using the following settings: E-INS-i method, recommended for sequences with multiple conserved domains and long gaps and discarding the gaps. The likelihood tree was made from 35 sequences each having a length of 842 nucleotides. The model selected by ModelFinder was TPM3u + F + G4. The Log-likelihood of the tree was -4201.04.  pLS20 family phylogenetic tree based on conserved CDS of pLS20-like plasmids  This tree was constructed with the help of the get_homologues and get_phylomarkers programs (46,50). Clusters of orthologous genes (COG) detected by the get_homologues program were filtered on a pipeline in order to identify high-quality markers, whose coding DNA sequences were subsequently concatenated and used to elaborate a likelihood tree using IQ-TREE. The get_homologues program was applied using the following parameters: COG algorithm, E-value < 1e-5 and coverage > 60. The settings of the Get_phylomarkers program were as follows. IQ-TREE algorithm, k 1.0, m 0.6, T high and test all DNA models. The resulting tree was based on an alignment of 34 sequences corresponding to a concatenated 5186 long nucleotide sequence. The CDS from which the concatenated sequence of each plasmid was obtained corresponded to genes 24c (alp7A), 25 (rap), 28, 36, 38, 39, 40, 58 (rel) and 60 (according to the nomenclature of plasmid pLS20). The substitution model was GTR+F+ASC+G4. The Log-likelihood of the tree: -48326.87.  Phylogenetic tree of the Rap proteins  The MAFFT algorithm applying the following settings aligned the sequences of the Rap proteins of the seven pLS20-like plasmids analysed in the comparative study. G-INS-i method, recommended for sequences with global homology, and discarding the gaps. The likelihood tree was made from eight sequences with 386 residues. The model selected by ModelFinder was cpREV+F+I+G4. The Log-likelihood of the tree is -5289.94.  The constructed trees were used to determine (sub)clades. For this purpose, the program ‘TreeCluster’ was used, selecting the clustering method, Avg Clade, threshold 0.045 (51). This program allows defining clusters from phylogenetic trees applying the same criterion (chosen algorithm) to all the branches of the tree, which facilitates the interpretation and consistency of the clades/clusters.

PMC8557374,Abstract,Abstract,GCA_001587195,0,0,0,,,"  Abstract  Conjugation plays important roles in genome plasticity, adaptation and evolution but is also the major horizontal gene-transfer route responsible for spreading toxin, virulence and antibiotic resistance genes. A better understanding of the conjugation process is required for developing drugs and strategies to impede the conjugation-mediated spread of these genes. So far, only a limited number of conjugative elements have been studied. For most of them, it is not known whether they represent a group of conjugative elements, nor about their distribution patterns. Here we show that pLS20 from the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis is the prototype conjugative plasmid of a family of at least 35 members that can be divided into four clades, and which are harboured by different Bacillus species found in different global locations and environmental niches. Analyses of their phylogenetic relationship and their conjugation operons have expanded our understanding of a family of conjugative plasmids of Gram-positive origin.  ",FALSE,FALSE,

PMC8557374,CONCLUDING REMARKS,Other,GCA_001587195,0,0,0,?,,"  CONCLUDING REMARKS  Here we show that pLS20 constitutes the prototype of a family of related plasmids that are harboured by different Bacillus species distributed at very different geographical locations around the world. Although the plasmids share a conserved structural organization, they could be divided into four clades. Besides a variable region located in between the partition and conjugation modules, all the plasmids contain three conserved modules: a replication, a partitioning and a conjugation module. In addition, plasmids belonging to clades I and IV contain a DNA repair module that is comprised by genes uvrX and yolD, while plasmids belonging to clade II and two of the three clade III plasmids only contain a yolD gene. The very large conjugation module can be divided into two subregions. Except for one, all the other plasmids contain a 5′-located region of three genes that are responsible for controlling the activation of the conjugation pathway. This region is followed by a very large operon encoding all the genes required for the different steps of the conjugation pathway. Remarkably, the sequential steps of the conjugation process are reflected by the order of genes within the conjugation operon. Thus, the first two genes of the conjugation operon constitute a bipartite P-AT system. These two genes are followed by genes involved in the first steps of the conjugation process: selection of and attachment to a recipient cell. The regions downstream are occupied respectively by genes encoding proteins involved in steps two (generation of the T4SS), three (DNA processing) and four (conversion of single-stranded to double-stranded plasmid DNA). Comparative analysis of representative plasmids of the different clades revealed that most of the genes located in the conjugation operons are conserved in all plasmids, indicating that these perform important functions. In addition, some plasmids contain a few or several unique genes that may contribute additional features. The results of the comparative analyses are useful for future studies, not only allowing conserved and unique genes between plasmids of the pLS20 family to be differentiated, and conserved residues or regions within homologous protein to be identified, our analyses also help better understanding of the relationship between the pLS20 family plasmids and other conjugative plasmids of G+ bacteria.

PMC8557374,INTRODUCTION,Introduction,GCA_001587195,1,0,0,,,"  INTRODUCTION  Many bacteria possess autonomously replicating extrachromosomal DNA molecules named plasmids, which are composed of essential and—most often—one or more modules that are non-essential to the plasmid (1–3). In this work, we define a module as a DNA region containing all the genes and/or genetic information for performing a function or cellular process. One of the modules that is essential for all plasmids concerns a replication module responsible for regulating (initiation of) DNA replication and thereby controlling the plasmid copy number. Most plasmids replicate via the theta or the rolling-circle mechanism. Large low-copy number theta-replicating plasmids contain a segregation module whose encoded proteins ensure faithful partitioning of the plasmid during cell division. A large subset of plasmids is mobile due to the presence of a non-essential module allowing the plasmid to transfer itself horizontally to other cells via conjugation or mobilization (see below). Genes encoding virulence determinants, toxins or antibiotic resistance are often present on conjugative or mobilizable plasmids, and so can efficiently spread, causing major clinical problems and enormous economic consequences worldwide (4,5). A better understanding of the conjugation and mobilization processes is warranted to help develop drugs and strategies impeding the spread of pernicious genes by these transfer routes.  Conjugation modules comprise all the genes required for performing the following steps in the conjugation process. First, selection of and attachment to the recipient cell. Two, generation of a sophisticated translocation channel, a type IV secretion system (T4SS), connecting the donor and the recipient cells. Three, DNA processing generating the DNA form that is transferred, which in most cases is a single DNA-strand (ssDNA), and subsequent transport of the ssDNA strand through the T4SS. Finally, establishment of the transferred DNA in the recipient cell by converting the ssDNA into a double-stranded DNA molecule. Mobilizable plasmids only encode the proteins involved in the DNA processing reaction and exploit the proteins generated by a conjugative plasmid that are necessary for transfer. Because the conjugation process involves many genes, conjugative plasmids are large and use the theta type of replication during growth. Mobilizable plasmids are much smaller and can use the theta or rolling circle mechanism of replication. Conjugative elements can also be embedded in the bacterial chromosome, which are then named integrated and conjugative elements (ICE). Excellent reviews on the process of conjugation have been published elsewhere (6–13).  Conjugation occurs in both Gram-positive (G+) and Gram-negative (G-) bacteria. However, conjugative elements from G+ bacteria are less well studied than those from G− and the available information is based on a very limited number of conjugative plasmids that share little similarity between them. Although these studies have provided important insights, results on conjugation systems will have added relevance and impacts if they concern a prototype plasmid representing a family of related plasmids. For instance, comprehensive analysis of multiple related sequences may discriminate essential from non-essential genes and identify conserved regions or residues within a set of orthologous proteins that may be important for function.  The conjugative plasmid pLS20 (≈65 kb) was originally identified from the Bacillus subtilis natto strain IFO3335 (14). We chose to study pLS20 because it was the only known conjugative B. subtilis plasmid at the time we started, and its replication and partition module had already been identified and characterized (15–17). Contrary to most conjugative systems, pLS20 conjugates efficiently in both solid and liquid media (18–21). Since conjugation in liquid medium is rapid and gives very reproducible results, pLS20 is an attractive system to study conjugation. In the recent years, considerable progress has been made in understanding some aspects of the pLS20 conjugation process, particularly about mating pair formation, regulation of the conjugation genes and the DNA processing reaction (21–29).  Previously, we have shown that the 43 kb plasmid p576 from the Bacillus pumilus strain NRS576 isolated from the USA is related to pLS20 that was isolated from a B. subtilis natto strain in Japan (30–33). This suggested that pLS20 might be the prototype of a family of related plasmids. Here, we show that this is indeed the case. We have identified 35 plasmids in the public databases that are related to pLS20. The majority of these were not annotated as a plasmid but we reconstructed them from multiple contigs that are present in different next-generation sequencing (NGS) projects. All these 35 plasmids are harboured by different Bacillus species, and they could be classified into four clades. The identified plasmids have a conserved organization sharing similar origin, partitioning and conjugation modules, as well as several genes of unknown function. In addition, the majority of these pLS20 family plasmids also contain a DNA repair module. The (dis)similarities between the plasmids are analysed and discussed, providing important information for our understanding of these important and wide spread plasmids, and for future research in conjugation-related studies in general, particularly for those in G+ bacteria.

PMC8557374,MATERIALS AND METHODS,Materials and Methods,GCA_001587195,0,0,0,,,"  MATERIALS AND METHODS  Bacterial strains, plasmids and oligonucleotides  Bacterial strains were grown in Lysogeny Broth (LB) medium (34) or plated on LB plates containing 1.5% agar. When appropriate, the following antibiotics were added: ampicillin (100 μg/ml) for Escherichia coli. The strains, plasmids and oligonucleotides used are listed in Supplementary Tables S1, S2 and S3, respectively. All oligonucleotides were purchased from Isogen Life Science, The Netherlands.  DNA isolation and large plasmid screening  Bacillus strains were grown overnight at 37°C with shaking (180 RPM) in fresh LB medium in a total volume of 12 ml. The next day, 10 ml of the culture was pelleted in 5 Eppendorf tubes of 2 ml and processed as follows. Bacterial pellets were resuspended in 1 ml of Birnboim solution A (20% sucrose, 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.1, 10 mM EDTA and 50 mM NaCl) to which lysozyme was added freshly (2 mg/ml). After freezing the samples at -80°C and subsequent thawing, the tubes were incubated at 37°C with shaking during 15 min. The cells were lysed by adding 33 μl of 1% sarkosyl solution and proteinase K (100 μg/ml) to 1 ml of cell suspension and incubating the mixture at 60°C without shaking during 20 min. Next, the mixture was subjected to a phenol-chloroform extraction step and subsequently precipitated overnight in the presence of 96% ethanol. After washing with 70% ethanol solution, resulting DNA pellets were resuspended in sterile MiliQ water and treated with RNAse A. Finally, DNA samples (1–2 μl) were loaded on a 0.7% agarose gel (1× TBE buffer) without EtBr and run at 30 V for 16 h. Next, gels were stained with a 1xTBE solution containing EtBr for 2 h, followed by a destaining step and finally photographed under ultraviolet light.  Sequencing  Circularization of pBatNRS213  Plasmid pBatNRS213 was circularized as follows. A PCR was performed using total DNA extract of B. atrophaeus strain NRS213 as template DNA in combination with the outward oriented oligos oJV216 and oJV217 that hybridize near the ends of the linear contig corresponding to pBatNRS213 plasmid. The PCR product was digested with SalI and ligated into pBluescript II KS (+) vector linearized with the same restriction enzyme. The ligation mixture was used to transform competent E. coli XL-blue strain, and transformants were selected on LB agar plates supplemented with ampicillin, IPTG (1 mM) and X-gal (60 μg/ml). Some at randomly chosen colonies that had a white colour were analysed by colony PCR for the presence of an insert using oligos M13Fw-21_ext and M13-R. The positively identified derivative was named pJV40. The insert was sequenced by the Sanger method using oligos M13Fw-21_ext and M13-R.  Next-generation sequencing (NGS) of strain B. amyloliquefaciens B1895  A total DNA sample of B. amyloliquefaciens B1895 strain was used for sequence determination using the Illumina MiSeq platform. Preparation of samples and sequencing was done in collaboration with Dr Ricardo Ramos Parque Científico de Madrid (Madrid, Spain). DNA libraries were prepared with the NEBNext DNA library prep kit for Illumina (New England Biolabs). Briefly, 1 μg DNA was sonicated, and fragments of □675 or 1075 bp were selected. DNA ends were repaired, A-tailed and then ligated to adapters. Next, fragments were PCR amplified (8 cycles) and quality checked on a DNA 7500 chip on a 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent). Library sizes of 800 and 1200 bp were isolated, validated (Bioanalyzer) and titrated with quantitative PCR (qPCR). After denaturation, the libraries were seeded on a flow cell (MiSeq v2, 2×150 bp) at a density of 16 pM. Importantly, sequencing conditions were applied that resulted in in deep sequencing (∼4 Gb of sequence data). Adapters and low-quality sequences were removed (35,36). After verifying the quality of the processed data (FastQC), de novo assembly was performed using software SPAdes (mode careful active; cov-cutoff auto; k-mer sizes 21,33,55,77,99,127; other parameters set as the default parameter) (37,38). PlasmidSPAdes (same parameters as used for the previous assembly) was also used to carry out another complementary assembly to identify the extrachromosomal elements (39). The resulting assemblies were evaluated using Quast to generate summary statistics (no of contigs, total length, GC%, N50, L50) (40). The plasmid was circularized using a dedicated perl script that searches for reads within the original sequencing data that span both ends of a contig (41). For a contig to be considered circular there had to be at least three reads spanning a minimum of 60 bp of each contig end. Final SPAdes assembly was automatically annotated using the PROKKA tool 1.14.5 (42). The annotation of plasmid pBamB1895 was checked manually and names were adapted to the nomenclature used for plasmid pLS20.  Bioinformatic methods  Identification of pLS20-like plasmids in the NCBI database reference genomes  The origin of replication region of pLS20 containing all the information for autonomous DNA replication (i.e. the replication module), spanning bp 64 501 to 65 745 of pLS20cat, accession number AB615352 was used as a query to carried out a BlastN search against the NCBI RefSeq genome database (BlastN algorithm, limited to bacteria (taxid 2)). All sequences with an e-value < 2e-133 and a query cover >50% were retrieved for subsequent analysis. The hits were organized depending on whether they concerned entire plasmid sequences or contigs. The complete sequences of plasmids were aligned using the algorithm directly EMBOSS Stretcher (43) or Nucmer (44). Before aligning, the plasmids were rotated and oriented such that plasmid ended with the first base pair of the alp7A gene. The Nucmer results presented as dot plot graphics in Supplementary Figure S1 were generated using mummerplot software. In the case of contigs, all the sequences belonging to the corresponding NGS project were downloaded to identify plasmid-related contigs. For this, a TblastX search was performed against all the sequences of the NGS project using as a query the sequences of the complete plasmids pLS20, pDSYZ, pBglSRCM103574 and p576. Contigs with an e-value 0.0 were identified as part of the plasmid. Subsequently, the identified contigs were aligned against the closest related query plasmid using the program Mauve (45). Besides confirming that the contig corresponded to a plasmid sequence, this allowed ordering and orienting the contigs, resulting in partially reconstructed plasmids.  Comparative genetic maps and protein analysis  Comparative studies were performed using a set of representative plasmids whose complete or almost complete sequence was known. The representative plasmids were selected based on the phylogenetic relatedness of the plasmids and corresponded to one plasmid of each (sub)clade (see below). The homologous genes of the selected plasmids were initially detected using the tools ‘get_homologues’ or ‘Blast’ (46,47). Initially identified homologies were checked by performing global pairwise alignment to confirm and optimize global alignments between pairs of sequences. The percentages of identity obtained by pairwise alignments were used to determine whether the genes encoding the proteins were considered homologous or not: proteins were considered homologous and not homologous when their identity levels were above 30 and below 15%, respectively. Additional analyses were performed for genes encoding proteins sharing identity levels between 15 and 30% to determine whether these proteins share common features. These analyses included the prediction of (i) transmembrane domains (TMHMM server, http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TMHMM/), (ii) an N-terminal sec-dependent secretion signal (SignalP-5.0 server, http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP/), (iii) coiled coil regions (COILS server, https://embnet.vital-it.ch/software/COILS_form.html) or (iv) any conserved domains or classification to a protein family (InterProScan, www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/services/web/toolform.ebi?tool=iprscan5&sequence). In addition, proteins were screened for similar secondary structure using the Jpred server (www.compbio.dundee.ac.uk/jpred/) or possible structural relationships using the HHPred server (toolkit.tuebingen.mpg.de/tools/hhpred). Genetic maps were generated using the GenomeDiagram module (Biopython, biopython.org) and edited with Inkscape software to manually annotate and represent the homology relationships on the plasmids maps.  Phylogenetic trees  Phylogenetic trees were constructed using IQ-TREE software (48). In all cases, the IQ-TREE software was allowed to determine the substitution model to be used through the ModelFinder module (49), and the ultrafast bootstrap statistical method (1000 replicates) was applied. The root was placed at the midpoint on the unrooted generated trees. The specific conditions, parameters and statistics applied for each tree were as follows.  pLS20 family phylogenetic tree based on the replication module  This tree was constructed from an alignment generated by the MAFFT algorithm (mafft.cbrc.jp/alignment/server/) using the following settings: E-INS-i method, recommended for sequences with multiple conserved domains and long gaps and discarding the gaps. The likelihood tree was made from 35 sequences each having a length of 842 nucleotides. The model selected by ModelFinder was TPM3u + F + G4. The Log-likelihood of the tree was -4201.04.  pLS20 family phylogenetic tree based on conserved CDS of pLS20-like plasmids  This tree was constructed with the help of the get_homologues and get_phylomarkers programs (46,50). Clusters of orthologous genes (COG) detected by the get_homologues program were filtered on a pipeline in order to identify high-quality markers, whose coding DNA sequences were subsequently concatenated and used to elaborate a likelihood tree using IQ-TREE. The get_homologues program was applied using the following parameters: COG algorithm, E-value < 1e-5 and coverage > 60. The settings of the Get_phylomarkers program were as follows. IQ-TREE algorithm, k 1.0, m 0.6, T high and test all DNA models. The resulting tree was based on an alignment of 34 sequences corresponding to a concatenated 5186 long nucleotide sequence. The CDS from which the concatenated sequence of each plasmid was obtained corresponded to genes 24c (alp7A), 25 (rap), 28, 36, 38, 39, 40, 58 (rel) and 60 (according to the nomenclature of plasmid pLS20). The substitution model was GTR+F+ASC+G4. The Log-likelihood of the tree: -48326.87.  Phylogenetic tree of the Rap proteins  The MAFFT algorithm applying the following settings aligned the sequences of the Rap proteins of the seven pLS20-like plasmids analysed in the comparative study. G-INS-i method, recommended for sequences with global homology, and discarding the gaps. The likelihood tree was made from eight sequences with 386 residues. The model selected by ModelFinder was cpREV+F+I+G4. The Log-likelihood of the tree is -5289.94.  The constructed trees were used to determine (sub)clades. For this purpose, the program ‘TreeCluster’ was used, selecting the clustering method, Avg Clade, threshold 0.045 (51). This program allows defining clusters from phylogenetic trees applying the same criterion (chosen algorithm) to all the branches of the tree, which facilitates the interpretation and consistency of the clades/clusters.

PMC8557374,Abstract,Abstract,GCA_001591925,0,0,0,,,"  Abstract  Conjugation plays important roles in genome plasticity, adaptation and evolution but is also the major horizontal gene-transfer route responsible for spreading toxin, virulence and antibiotic resistance genes. A better understanding of the conjugation process is required for developing drugs and strategies to impede the conjugation-mediated spread of these genes. So far, only a limited number of conjugative elements have been studied. For most of them, it is not known whether they represent a group of conjugative elements, nor about their distribution patterns. Here we show that pLS20 from the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis is the prototype conjugative plasmid of a family of at least 35 members that can be divided into four clades, and which are harboured by different Bacillus species found in different global locations and environmental niches. Analyses of their phylogenetic relationship and their conjugation operons have expanded our understanding of a family of conjugative plasmids of Gram-positive origin.  ",FALSE,FALSE,

PMC8557374,CONCLUDING REMARKS,Other,GCA_001591925,0,0,0,?,,"  CONCLUDING REMARKS  Here we show that pLS20 constitutes the prototype of a family of related plasmids that are harboured by different Bacillus species distributed at very different geographical locations around the world. Although the plasmids share a conserved structural organization, they could be divided into four clades. Besides a variable region located in between the partition and conjugation modules, all the plasmids contain three conserved modules: a replication, a partitioning and a conjugation module. In addition, plasmids belonging to clades I and IV contain a DNA repair module that is comprised by genes uvrX and yolD, while plasmids belonging to clade II and two of the three clade III plasmids only contain a yolD gene. The very large conjugation module can be divided into two subregions. Except for one, all the other plasmids contain a 5′-located region of three genes that are responsible for controlling the activation of the conjugation pathway. This region is followed by a very large operon encoding all the genes required for the different steps of the conjugation pathway. Remarkably, the sequential steps of the conjugation process are reflected by the order of genes within the conjugation operon. Thus, the first two genes of the conjugation operon constitute a bipartite P-AT system. These two genes are followed by genes involved in the first steps of the conjugation process: selection of and attachment to a recipient cell. The regions downstream are occupied respectively by genes encoding proteins involved in steps two (generation of the T4SS), three (DNA processing) and four (conversion of single-stranded to double-stranded plasmid DNA). Comparative analysis of representative plasmids of the different clades revealed that most of the genes located in the conjugation operons are conserved in all plasmids, indicating that these perform important functions. In addition, some plasmids contain a few or several unique genes that may contribute additional features. The results of the comparative analyses are useful for future studies, not only allowing conserved and unique genes between plasmids of the pLS20 family to be differentiated, and conserved residues or regions within homologous protein to be identified, our analyses also help better understanding of the relationship between the pLS20 family plasmids and other conjugative plasmids of G+ bacteria.

PMC8557374,INTRODUCTION,Introduction,GCA_001591925,1,0,0,,,"  INTRODUCTION  Many bacteria possess autonomously replicating extrachromosomal DNA molecules named plasmids, which are composed of essential and—most often—one or more modules that are non-essential to the plasmid (1–3). In this work, we define a module as a DNA region containing all the genes and/or genetic information for performing a function or cellular process. One of the modules that is essential for all plasmids concerns a replication module responsible for regulating (initiation of) DNA replication and thereby controlling the plasmid copy number. Most plasmids replicate via the theta or the rolling-circle mechanism. Large low-copy number theta-replicating plasmids contain a segregation module whose encoded proteins ensure faithful partitioning of the plasmid during cell division. A large subset of plasmids is mobile due to the presence of a non-essential module allowing the plasmid to transfer itself horizontally to other cells via conjugation or mobilization (see below). Genes encoding virulence determinants, toxins or antibiotic resistance are often present on conjugative or mobilizable plasmids, and so can efficiently spread, causing major clinical problems and enormous economic consequences worldwide (4,5). A better understanding of the conjugation and mobilization processes is warranted to help develop drugs and strategies impeding the spread of pernicious genes by these transfer routes.  Conjugation modules comprise all the genes required for performing the following steps in the conjugation process. First, selection of and attachment to the recipient cell. Two, generation of a sophisticated translocation channel, a type IV secretion system (T4SS), connecting the donor and the recipient cells. Three, DNA processing generating the DNA form that is transferred, which in most cases is a single DNA-strand (ssDNA), and subsequent transport of the ssDNA strand through the T4SS. Finally, establishment of the transferred DNA in the recipient cell by converting the ssDNA into a double-stranded DNA molecule. Mobilizable plasmids only encode the proteins involved in the DNA processing reaction and exploit the proteins generated by a conjugative plasmid that are necessary for transfer. Because the conjugation process involves many genes, conjugative plasmids are large and use the theta type of replication during growth. Mobilizable plasmids are much smaller and can use the theta or rolling circle mechanism of replication. Conjugative elements can also be embedded in the bacterial chromosome, which are then named integrated and conjugative elements (ICE). Excellent reviews on the process of conjugation have been published elsewhere (6–13).  Conjugation occurs in both Gram-positive (G+) and Gram-negative (G-) bacteria. However, conjugative elements from G+ bacteria are less well studied than those from G− and the available information is based on a very limited number of conjugative plasmids that share little similarity between them. Although these studies have provided important insights, results on conjugation systems will have added relevance and impacts if they concern a prototype plasmid representing a family of related plasmids. For instance, comprehensive analysis of multiple related sequences may discriminate essential from non-essential genes and identify conserved regions or residues within a set of orthologous proteins that may be important for function.  The conjugative plasmid pLS20 (≈65 kb) was originally identified from the Bacillus subtilis natto strain IFO3335 (14). We chose to study pLS20 because it was the only known conjugative B. subtilis plasmid at the time we started, and its replication and partition module had already been identified and characterized (15–17). Contrary to most conjugative systems, pLS20 conjugates efficiently in both solid and liquid media (18–21). Since conjugation in liquid medium is rapid and gives very reproducible results, pLS20 is an attractive system to study conjugation. In the recent years, considerable progress has been made in understanding some aspects of the pLS20 conjugation process, particularly about mating pair formation, regulation of the conjugation genes and the DNA processing reaction (21–29).  Previously, we have shown that the 43 kb plasmid p576 from the Bacillus pumilus strain NRS576 isolated from the USA is related to pLS20 that was isolated from a B. subtilis natto strain in Japan (30–33). This suggested that pLS20 might be the prototype of a family of related plasmids. Here, we show that this is indeed the case. We have identified 35 plasmids in the public databases that are related to pLS20. The majority of these were not annotated as a plasmid but we reconstructed them from multiple contigs that are present in different next-generation sequencing (NGS) projects. All these 35 plasmids are harboured by different Bacillus species, and they could be classified into four clades. The identified plasmids have a conserved organization sharing similar origin, partitioning and conjugation modules, as well as several genes of unknown function. In addition, the majority of these pLS20 family plasmids also contain a DNA repair module. The (dis)similarities between the plasmids are analysed and discussed, providing important information for our understanding of these important and wide spread plasmids, and for future research in conjugation-related studies in general, particularly for those in G+ bacteria.

PMC8557374,MATERIALS AND METHODS,Materials and Methods,GCA_001591925,0,0,0,,,"  MATERIALS AND METHODS  Bacterial strains, plasmids and oligonucleotides  Bacterial strains were grown in Lysogeny Broth (LB) medium (34) or plated on LB plates containing 1.5% agar. When appropriate, the following antibiotics were added: ampicillin (100 μg/ml) for Escherichia coli. The strains, plasmids and oligonucleotides used are listed in Supplementary Tables S1, S2 and S3, respectively. All oligonucleotides were purchased from Isogen Life Science, The Netherlands.  DNA isolation and large plasmid screening  Bacillus strains were grown overnight at 37°C with shaking (180 RPM) in fresh LB medium in a total volume of 12 ml. The next day, 10 ml of the culture was pelleted in 5 Eppendorf tubes of 2 ml and processed as follows. Bacterial pellets were resuspended in 1 ml of Birnboim solution A (20% sucrose, 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.1, 10 mM EDTA and 50 mM NaCl) to which lysozyme was added freshly (2 mg/ml). After freezing the samples at -80°C and subsequent thawing, the tubes were incubated at 37°C with shaking during 15 min. The cells were lysed by adding 33 μl of 1% sarkosyl solution and proteinase K (100 μg/ml) to 1 ml of cell suspension and incubating the mixture at 60°C without shaking during 20 min. Next, the mixture was subjected to a phenol-chloroform extraction step and subsequently precipitated overnight in the presence of 96% ethanol. After washing with 70% ethanol solution, resulting DNA pellets were resuspended in sterile MiliQ water and treated with RNAse A. Finally, DNA samples (1–2 μl) were loaded on a 0.7% agarose gel (1× TBE buffer) without EtBr and run at 30 V for 16 h. Next, gels were stained with a 1xTBE solution containing EtBr for 2 h, followed by a destaining step and finally photographed under ultraviolet light.  Sequencing  Circularization of pBatNRS213  Plasmid pBatNRS213 was circularized as follows. A PCR was performed using total DNA extract of B. atrophaeus strain NRS213 as template DNA in combination with the outward oriented oligos oJV216 and oJV217 that hybridize near the ends of the linear contig corresponding to pBatNRS213 plasmid. The PCR product was digested with SalI and ligated into pBluescript II KS (+) vector linearized with the same restriction enzyme. The ligation mixture was used to transform competent E. coli XL-blue strain, and transformants were selected on LB agar plates supplemented with ampicillin, IPTG (1 mM) and X-gal (60 μg/ml). Some at randomly chosen colonies that had a white colour were analysed by colony PCR for the presence of an insert using oligos M13Fw-21_ext and M13-R. The positively identified derivative was named pJV40. The insert was sequenced by the Sanger method using oligos M13Fw-21_ext and M13-R.  Next-generation sequencing (NGS) of strain B. amyloliquefaciens B1895  A total DNA sample of B. amyloliquefaciens B1895 strain was used for sequence determination using the Illumina MiSeq platform. Preparation of samples and sequencing was done in collaboration with Dr Ricardo Ramos Parque Científico de Madrid (Madrid, Spain). DNA libraries were prepared with the NEBNext DNA library prep kit for Illumina (New England Biolabs). Briefly, 1 μg DNA was sonicated, and fragments of □675 or 1075 bp were selected. DNA ends were repaired, A-tailed and then ligated to adapters. Next, fragments were PCR amplified (8 cycles) and quality checked on a DNA 7500 chip on a 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent). Library sizes of 800 and 1200 bp were isolated, validated (Bioanalyzer) and titrated with quantitative PCR (qPCR). After denaturation, the libraries were seeded on a flow cell (MiSeq v2, 2×150 bp) at a density of 16 pM. Importantly, sequencing conditions were applied that resulted in in deep sequencing (∼4 Gb of sequence data). Adapters and low-quality sequences were removed (35,36). After verifying the quality of the processed data (FastQC), de novo assembly was performed using software SPAdes (mode careful active; cov-cutoff auto; k-mer sizes 21,33,55,77,99,127; other parameters set as the default parameter) (37,38). PlasmidSPAdes (same parameters as used for the previous assembly) was also used to carry out another complementary assembly to identify the extrachromosomal elements (39). The resulting assemblies were evaluated using Quast to generate summary statistics (no of contigs, total length, GC%, N50, L50) (40). The plasmid was circularized using a dedicated perl script that searches for reads within the original sequencing data that span both ends of a contig (41). For a contig to be considered circular there had to be at least three reads spanning a minimum of 60 bp of each contig end. Final SPAdes assembly was automatically annotated using the PROKKA tool 1.14.5 (42). The annotation of plasmid pBamB1895 was checked manually and names were adapted to the nomenclature used for plasmid pLS20.  Bioinformatic methods  Identification of pLS20-like plasmids in the NCBI database reference genomes  The origin of replication region of pLS20 containing all the information for autonomous DNA replication (i.e. the replication module), spanning bp 64 501 to 65 745 of pLS20cat, accession number AB615352 was used as a query to carried out a BlastN search against the NCBI RefSeq genome database (BlastN algorithm, limited to bacteria (taxid 2)). All sequences with an e-value < 2e-133 and a query cover >50% were retrieved for subsequent analysis. The hits were organized depending on whether they concerned entire plasmid sequences or contigs. The complete sequences of plasmids were aligned using the algorithm directly EMBOSS Stretcher (43) or Nucmer (44). Before aligning, the plasmids were rotated and oriented such that plasmid ended with the first base pair of the alp7A gene. The Nucmer results presented as dot plot graphics in Supplementary Figure S1 were generated using mummerplot software. In the case of contigs, all the sequences belonging to the corresponding NGS project were downloaded to identify plasmid-related contigs. For this, a TblastX search was performed against all the sequences of the NGS project using as a query the sequences of the complete plasmids pLS20, pDSYZ, pBglSRCM103574 and p576. Contigs with an e-value 0.0 were identified as part of the plasmid. Subsequently, the identified contigs were aligned against the closest related query plasmid using the program Mauve (45). Besides confirming that the contig corresponded to a plasmid sequence, this allowed ordering and orienting the contigs, resulting in partially reconstructed plasmids.  Comparative genetic maps and protein analysis  Comparative studies were performed using a set of representative plasmids whose complete or almost complete sequence was known. The representative plasmids were selected based on the phylogenetic relatedness of the plasmids and corresponded to one plasmid of each (sub)clade (see below). The homologous genes of the selected plasmids were initially detected using the tools ‘get_homologues’ or ‘Blast’ (46,47). Initially identified homologies were checked by performing global pairwise alignment to confirm and optimize global alignments between pairs of sequences. The percentages of identity obtained by pairwise alignments were used to determine whether the genes encoding the proteins were considered homologous or not: proteins were considered homologous and not homologous when their identity levels were above 30 and below 15%, respectively. Additional analyses were performed for genes encoding proteins sharing identity levels between 15 and 30% to determine whether these proteins share common features. These analyses included the prediction of (i) transmembrane domains (TMHMM server, http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TMHMM/), (ii) an N-terminal sec-dependent secretion signal (SignalP-5.0 server, http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP/), (iii) coiled coil regions (COILS server, https://embnet.vital-it.ch/software/COILS_form.html) or (iv) any conserved domains or classification to a protein family (InterProScan, www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/services/web/toolform.ebi?tool=iprscan5&sequence). In addition, proteins were screened for similar secondary structure using the Jpred server (www.compbio.dundee.ac.uk/jpred/) or possible structural relationships using the HHPred server (toolkit.tuebingen.mpg.de/tools/hhpred). Genetic maps were generated using the GenomeDiagram module (Biopython, biopython.org) and edited with Inkscape software to manually annotate and represent the homology relationships on the plasmids maps.  Phylogenetic trees  Phylogenetic trees were constructed using IQ-TREE software (48). In all cases, the IQ-TREE software was allowed to determine the substitution model to be used through the ModelFinder module (49), and the ultrafast bootstrap statistical method (1000 replicates) was applied. The root was placed at the midpoint on the unrooted generated trees. The specific conditions, parameters and statistics applied for each tree were as follows.  pLS20 family phylogenetic tree based on the replication module  This tree was constructed from an alignment generated by the MAFFT algorithm (mafft.cbrc.jp/alignment/server/) using the following settings: E-INS-i method, recommended for sequences with multiple conserved domains and long gaps and discarding the gaps. The likelihood tree was made from 35 sequences each having a length of 842 nucleotides. The model selected by ModelFinder was TPM3u + F + G4. The Log-likelihood of the tree was -4201.04.  pLS20 family phylogenetic tree based on conserved CDS of pLS20-like plasmids  This tree was constructed with the help of the get_homologues and get_phylomarkers programs (46,50). Clusters of orthologous genes (COG) detected by the get_homologues program were filtered on a pipeline in order to identify high-quality markers, whose coding DNA sequences were subsequently concatenated and used to elaborate a likelihood tree using IQ-TREE. The get_homologues program was applied using the following parameters: COG algorithm, E-value < 1e-5 and coverage > 60. The settings of the Get_phylomarkers program were as follows. IQ-TREE algorithm, k 1.0, m 0.6, T high and test all DNA models. The resulting tree was based on an alignment of 34 sequences corresponding to a concatenated 5186 long nucleotide sequence. The CDS from which the concatenated sequence of each plasmid was obtained corresponded to genes 24c (alp7A), 25 (rap), 28, 36, 38, 39, 40, 58 (rel) and 60 (according to the nomenclature of plasmid pLS20). The substitution model was GTR+F+ASC+G4. The Log-likelihood of the tree: -48326.87.  Phylogenetic tree of the Rap proteins  The MAFFT algorithm applying the following settings aligned the sequences of the Rap proteins of the seven pLS20-like plasmids analysed in the comparative study. G-INS-i method, recommended for sequences with global homology, and discarding the gaps. The likelihood tree was made from eight sequences with 386 residues. The model selected by ModelFinder was cpREV+F+I+G4. The Log-likelihood of the tree is -5289.94.  The constructed trees were used to determine (sub)clades. For this purpose, the program ‘TreeCluster’ was used, selecting the clustering method, Avg Clade, threshold 0.045 (51). This program allows defining clusters from phylogenetic trees applying the same criterion (chosen algorithm) to all the branches of the tree, which facilitates the interpretation and consistency of the clades/clusters.

PMC8557374,Abstract,Abstract,GCF_001286965,0,0,0,,,"  Abstract  Conjugation plays important roles in genome plasticity, adaptation and evolution but is also the major horizontal gene-transfer route responsible for spreading toxin, virulence and antibiotic resistance genes. A better understanding of the conjugation process is required for developing drugs and strategies to impede the conjugation-mediated spread of these genes. So far, only a limited number of conjugative elements have been studied. For most of them, it is not known whether they represent a group of conjugative elements, nor about their distribution patterns. Here we show that pLS20 from the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis is the prototype conjugative plasmid of a family of at least 35 members that can be divided into four clades, and which are harboured by different Bacillus species found in different global locations and environmental niches. Analyses of their phylogenetic relationship and their conjugation operons have expanded our understanding of a family of conjugative plasmids of Gram-positive origin.  ",FALSE,FALSE,

PMC8557374,CONCLUDING REMARKS,Other,GCF_001286965,0,0,0,?,,"  CONCLUDING REMARKS  Here we show that pLS20 constitutes the prototype of a family of related plasmids that are harboured by different Bacillus species distributed at very different geographical locations around the world. Although the plasmids share a conserved structural organization, they could be divided into four clades. Besides a variable region located in between the partition and conjugation modules, all the plasmids contain three conserved modules: a replication, a partitioning and a conjugation module. In addition, plasmids belonging to clades I and IV contain a DNA repair module that is comprised by genes uvrX and yolD, while plasmids belonging to clade II and two of the three clade III plasmids only contain a yolD gene. The very large conjugation module can be divided into two subregions. Except for one, all the other plasmids contain a 5′-located region of three genes that are responsible for controlling the activation of the conjugation pathway. This region is followed by a very large operon encoding all the genes required for the different steps of the conjugation pathway. Remarkably, the sequential steps of the conjugation process are reflected by the order of genes within the conjugation operon. Thus, the first two genes of the conjugation operon constitute a bipartite P-AT system. These two genes are followed by genes involved in the first steps of the conjugation process: selection of and attachment to a recipient cell. The regions downstream are occupied respectively by genes encoding proteins involved in steps two (generation of the T4SS), three (DNA processing) and four (conversion of single-stranded to double-stranded plasmid DNA). Comparative analysis of representative plasmids of the different clades revealed that most of the genes located in the conjugation operons are conserved in all plasmids, indicating that these perform important functions. In addition, some plasmids contain a few or several unique genes that may contribute additional features. The results of the comparative analyses are useful for future studies, not only allowing conserved and unique genes between plasmids of the pLS20 family to be differentiated, and conserved residues or regions within homologous protein to be identified, our analyses also help better understanding of the relationship between the pLS20 family plasmids and other conjugative plasmids of G+ bacteria.

PMC8557374,INTRODUCTION,Introduction,GCF_001286965,1,0,0,,,"  INTRODUCTION  Many bacteria possess autonomously replicating extrachromosomal DNA molecules named plasmids, which are composed of essential and—most often—one or more modules that are non-essential to the plasmid (1–3). In this work, we define a module as a DNA region containing all the genes and/or genetic information for performing a function or cellular process. One of the modules that is essential for all plasmids concerns a replication module responsible for regulating (initiation of) DNA replication and thereby controlling the plasmid copy number. Most plasmids replicate via the theta or the rolling-circle mechanism. Large low-copy number theta-replicating plasmids contain a segregation module whose encoded proteins ensure faithful partitioning of the plasmid during cell division. A large subset of plasmids is mobile due to the presence of a non-essential module allowing the plasmid to transfer itself horizontally to other cells via conjugation or mobilization (see below). Genes encoding virulence determinants, toxins or antibiotic resistance are often present on conjugative or mobilizable plasmids, and so can efficiently spread, causing major clinical problems and enormous economic consequences worldwide (4,5). A better understanding of the conjugation and mobilization processes is warranted to help develop drugs and strategies impeding the spread of pernicious genes by these transfer routes.  Conjugation modules comprise all the genes required for performing the following steps in the conjugation process. First, selection of and attachment to the recipient cell. Two, generation of a sophisticated translocation channel, a type IV secretion system (T4SS), connecting the donor and the recipient cells. Three, DNA processing generating the DNA form that is transferred, which in most cases is a single DNA-strand (ssDNA), and subsequent transport of the ssDNA strand through the T4SS. Finally, establishment of the transferred DNA in the recipient cell by converting the ssDNA into a double-stranded DNA molecule. Mobilizable plasmids only encode the proteins involved in the DNA processing reaction and exploit the proteins generated by a conjugative plasmid that are necessary for transfer. Because the conjugation process involves many genes, conjugative plasmids are large and use the theta type of replication during growth. Mobilizable plasmids are much smaller and can use the theta or rolling circle mechanism of replication. Conjugative elements can also be embedded in the bacterial chromosome, which are then named integrated and conjugative elements (ICE). Excellent reviews on the process of conjugation have been published elsewhere (6–13).  Conjugation occurs in both Gram-positive (G+) and Gram-negative (G-) bacteria. However, conjugative elements from G+ bacteria are less well studied than those from G− and the available information is based on a very limited number of conjugative plasmids that share little similarity between them. Although these studies have provided important insights, results on conjugation systems will have added relevance and impacts if they concern a prototype plasmid representing a family of related plasmids. For instance, comprehensive analysis of multiple related sequences may discriminate essential from non-essential genes and identify conserved regions or residues within a set of orthologous proteins that may be important for function.  The conjugative plasmid pLS20 (≈65 kb) was originally identified from the Bacillus subtilis natto strain IFO3335 (14). We chose to study pLS20 because it was the only known conjugative B. subtilis plasmid at the time we started, and its replication and partition module had already been identified and characterized (15–17). Contrary to most conjugative systems, pLS20 conjugates efficiently in both solid and liquid media (18–21). Since conjugation in liquid medium is rapid and gives very reproducible results, pLS20 is an attractive system to study conjugation. In the recent years, considerable progress has been made in understanding some aspects of the pLS20 conjugation process, particularly about mating pair formation, regulation of the conjugation genes and the DNA processing reaction (21–29).  Previously, we have shown that the 43 kb plasmid p576 from the Bacillus pumilus strain NRS576 isolated from the USA is related to pLS20 that was isolated from a B. subtilis natto strain in Japan (30–33). This suggested that pLS20 might be the prototype of a family of related plasmids. Here, we show that this is indeed the case. We have identified 35 plasmids in the public databases that are related to pLS20. The majority of these were not annotated as a plasmid but we reconstructed them from multiple contigs that are present in different next-generation sequencing (NGS) projects. All these 35 plasmids are harboured by different Bacillus species, and they could be classified into four clades. The identified plasmids have a conserved organization sharing similar origin, partitioning and conjugation modules, as well as several genes of unknown function. In addition, the majority of these pLS20 family plasmids also contain a DNA repair module. The (dis)similarities between the plasmids are analysed and discussed, providing important information for our understanding of these important and wide spread plasmids, and for future research in conjugation-related studies in general, particularly for those in G+ bacteria.

PMC8557374,MATERIALS AND METHODS,Materials and Methods,GCF_001286965,0,0,0,,,"  MATERIALS AND METHODS  Bacterial strains, plasmids and oligonucleotides  Bacterial strains were grown in Lysogeny Broth (LB) medium (34) or plated on LB plates containing 1.5% agar. When appropriate, the following antibiotics were added: ampicillin (100 μg/ml) for Escherichia coli. The strains, plasmids and oligonucleotides used are listed in Supplementary Tables S1, S2 and S3, respectively. All oligonucleotides were purchased from Isogen Life Science, The Netherlands.  DNA isolation and large plasmid screening  Bacillus strains were grown overnight at 37°C with shaking (180 RPM) in fresh LB medium in a total volume of 12 ml. The next day, 10 ml of the culture was pelleted in 5 Eppendorf tubes of 2 ml and processed as follows. Bacterial pellets were resuspended in 1 ml of Birnboim solution A (20% sucrose, 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.1, 10 mM EDTA and 50 mM NaCl) to which lysozyme was added freshly (2 mg/ml). After freezing the samples at -80°C and subsequent thawing, the tubes were incubated at 37°C with shaking during 15 min. The cells were lysed by adding 33 μl of 1% sarkosyl solution and proteinase K (100 μg/ml) to 1 ml of cell suspension and incubating the mixture at 60°C without shaking during 20 min. Next, the mixture was subjected to a phenol-chloroform extraction step and subsequently precipitated overnight in the presence of 96% ethanol. After washing with 70% ethanol solution, resulting DNA pellets were resuspended in sterile MiliQ water and treated with RNAse A. Finally, DNA samples (1–2 μl) were loaded on a 0.7% agarose gel (1× TBE buffer) without EtBr and run at 30 V for 16 h. Next, gels were stained with a 1xTBE solution containing EtBr for 2 h, followed by a destaining step and finally photographed under ultraviolet light.  Sequencing  Circularization of pBatNRS213  Plasmid pBatNRS213 was circularized as follows. A PCR was performed using total DNA extract of B. atrophaeus strain NRS213 as template DNA in combination with the outward oriented oligos oJV216 and oJV217 that hybridize near the ends of the linear contig corresponding to pBatNRS213 plasmid. The PCR product was digested with SalI and ligated into pBluescript II KS (+) vector linearized with the same restriction enzyme. The ligation mixture was used to transform competent E. coli XL-blue strain, and transformants were selected on LB agar plates supplemented with ampicillin, IPTG (1 mM) and X-gal (60 μg/ml). Some at randomly chosen colonies that had a white colour were analysed by colony PCR for the presence of an insert using oligos M13Fw-21_ext and M13-R. The positively identified derivative was named pJV40. The insert was sequenced by the Sanger method using oligos M13Fw-21_ext and M13-R.  Next-generation sequencing (NGS) of strain B. amyloliquefaciens B1895  A total DNA sample of B. amyloliquefaciens B1895 strain was used for sequence determination using the Illumina MiSeq platform. Preparation of samples and sequencing was done in collaboration with Dr Ricardo Ramos Parque Científico de Madrid (Madrid, Spain). DNA libraries were prepared with the NEBNext DNA library prep kit for Illumina (New England Biolabs). Briefly, 1 μg DNA was sonicated, and fragments of □675 or 1075 bp were selected. DNA ends were repaired, A-tailed and then ligated to adapters. Next, fragments were PCR amplified (8 cycles) and quality checked on a DNA 7500 chip on a 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent). Library sizes of 800 and 1200 bp were isolated, validated (Bioanalyzer) and titrated with quantitative PCR (qPCR). After denaturation, the libraries were seeded on a flow cell (MiSeq v2, 2×150 bp) at a density of 16 pM. Importantly, sequencing conditions were applied that resulted in in deep sequencing (∼4 Gb of sequence data). Adapters and low-quality sequences were removed (35,36). After verifying the quality of the processed data (FastQC), de novo assembly was performed using software SPAdes (mode careful active; cov-cutoff auto; k-mer sizes 21,33,55,77,99,127; other parameters set as the default parameter) (37,38). PlasmidSPAdes (same parameters as used for the previous assembly) was also used to carry out another complementary assembly to identify the extrachromosomal elements (39). The resulting assemblies were evaluated using Quast to generate summary statistics (no of contigs, total length, GC%, N50, L50) (40). The plasmid was circularized using a dedicated perl script that searches for reads within the original sequencing data that span both ends of a contig (41). For a contig to be considered circular there had to be at least three reads spanning a minimum of 60 bp of each contig end. Final SPAdes assembly was automatically annotated using the PROKKA tool 1.14.5 (42). The annotation of plasmid pBamB1895 was checked manually and names were adapted to the nomenclature used for plasmid pLS20.  Bioinformatic methods  Identification of pLS20-like plasmids in the NCBI database reference genomes  The origin of replication region of pLS20 containing all the information for autonomous DNA replication (i.e. the replication module), spanning bp 64 501 to 65 745 of pLS20cat, accession number AB615352 was used as a query to carried out a BlastN search against the NCBI RefSeq genome database (BlastN algorithm, limited to bacteria (taxid 2)). All sequences with an e-value < 2e-133 and a query cover >50% were retrieved for subsequent analysis. The hits were organized depending on whether they concerned entire plasmid sequences or contigs. The complete sequences of plasmids were aligned using the algorithm directly EMBOSS Stretcher (43) or Nucmer (44). Before aligning, the plasmids were rotated and oriented such that plasmid ended with the first base pair of the alp7A gene. The Nucmer results presented as dot plot graphics in Supplementary Figure S1 were generated using mummerplot software. In the case of contigs, all the sequences belonging to the corresponding NGS project were downloaded to identify plasmid-related contigs. For this, a TblastX search was performed against all the sequences of the NGS project using as a query the sequences of the complete plasmids pLS20, pDSYZ, pBglSRCM103574 and p576. Contigs with an e-value 0.0 were identified as part of the plasmid. Subsequently, the identified contigs were aligned against the closest related query plasmid using the program Mauve (45). Besides confirming that the contig corresponded to a plasmid sequence, this allowed ordering and orienting the contigs, resulting in partially reconstructed plasmids.  Comparative genetic maps and protein analysis  Comparative studies were performed using a set of representative plasmids whose complete or almost complete sequence was known. The representative plasmids were selected based on the phylogenetic relatedness of the plasmids and corresponded to one plasmid of each (sub)clade (see below). The homologous genes of the selected plasmids were initially detected using the tools ‘get_homologues’ or ‘Blast’ (46,47). Initially identified homologies were checked by performing global pairwise alignment to confirm and optimize global alignments between pairs of sequences. The percentages of identity obtained by pairwise alignments were used to determine whether the genes encoding the proteins were considered homologous or not: proteins were considered homologous and not homologous when their identity levels were above 30 and below 15%, respectively. Additional analyses were performed for genes encoding proteins sharing identity levels between 15 and 30% to determine whether these proteins share common features. These analyses included the prediction of (i) transmembrane domains (TMHMM server, http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TMHMM/), (ii) an N-terminal sec-dependent secretion signal (SignalP-5.0 server, http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP/), (iii) coiled coil regions (COILS server, https://embnet.vital-it.ch/software/COILS_form.html) or (iv) any conserved domains or classification to a protein family (InterProScan, www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/services/web/toolform.ebi?tool=iprscan5&sequence). In addition, proteins were screened for similar secondary structure using the Jpred server (www.compbio.dundee.ac.uk/jpred/) or possible structural relationships using the HHPred server (toolkit.tuebingen.mpg.de/tools/hhpred). Genetic maps were generated using the GenomeDiagram module (Biopython, biopython.org) and edited with Inkscape software to manually annotate and represent the homology relationships on the plasmids maps.  Phylogenetic trees  Phylogenetic trees were constructed using IQ-TREE software (48). In all cases, the IQ-TREE software was allowed to determine the substitution model to be used through the ModelFinder module (49), and the ultrafast bootstrap statistical method (1000 replicates) was applied. The root was placed at the midpoint on the unrooted generated trees. The specific conditions, parameters and statistics applied for each tree were as follows.  pLS20 family phylogenetic tree based on the replication module  This tree was constructed from an alignment generated by the MAFFT algorithm (mafft.cbrc.jp/alignment/server/) using the following settings: E-INS-i method, recommended for sequences with multiple conserved domains and long gaps and discarding the gaps. The likelihood tree was made from 35 sequences each having a length of 842 nucleotides. The model selected by ModelFinder was TPM3u + F + G4. The Log-likelihood of the tree was -4201.04.  pLS20 family phylogenetic tree based on conserved CDS of pLS20-like plasmids  This tree was constructed with the help of the get_homologues and get_phylomarkers programs (46,50). Clusters of orthologous genes (COG) detected by the get_homologues program were filtered on a pipeline in order to identify high-quality markers, whose coding DNA sequences were subsequently concatenated and used to elaborate a likelihood tree using IQ-TREE. The get_homologues program was applied using the following parameters: COG algorithm, E-value < 1e-5 and coverage > 60. The settings of the Get_phylomarkers program were as follows. IQ-TREE algorithm, k 1.0, m 0.6, T high and test all DNA models. The resulting tree was based on an alignment of 34 sequences corresponding to a concatenated 5186 long nucleotide sequence. The CDS from which the concatenated sequence of each plasmid was obtained corresponded to genes 24c (alp7A), 25 (rap), 28, 36, 38, 39, 40, 58 (rel) and 60 (according to the nomenclature of plasmid pLS20). The substitution model was GTR+F+ASC+G4. The Log-likelihood of the tree: -48326.87.  Phylogenetic tree of the Rap proteins  The MAFFT algorithm applying the following settings aligned the sequences of the Rap proteins of the seven pLS20-like plasmids analysed in the comparative study. G-INS-i method, recommended for sequences with global homology, and discarding the gaps. The likelihood tree was made from eight sequences with 386 residues. The model selected by ModelFinder was cpREV+F+I+G4. The Log-likelihood of the tree is -5289.94.  The constructed trees were used to determine (sub)clades. For this purpose, the program ‘TreeCluster’ was used, selecting the clustering method, Avg Clade, threshold 0.045 (51). This program allows defining clusters from phylogenetic trees applying the same criterion (chosen algorithm) to all the branches of the tree, which facilitates the interpretation and consistency of the clades/clusters.

PMC8557374,Abstract,Abstract,GCF_001584335,0,0,0,,,"  Abstract  Conjugation plays important roles in genome plasticity, adaptation and evolution but is also the major horizontal gene-transfer route responsible for spreading toxin, virulence and antibiotic resistance genes. A better understanding of the conjugation process is required for developing drugs and strategies to impede the conjugation-mediated spread of these genes. So far, only a limited number of conjugative elements have been studied. For most of them, it is not known whether they represent a group of conjugative elements, nor about their distribution patterns. Here we show that pLS20 from the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis is the prototype conjugative plasmid of a family of at least 35 members that can be divided into four clades, and which are harboured by different Bacillus species found in different global locations and environmental niches. Analyses of their phylogenetic relationship and their conjugation operons have expanded our understanding of a family of conjugative plasmids of Gram-positive origin.

It turns out that all of these assembly accessions are referenced specifically in the 'hits annotated as contigs' bits of the paper. However, for this particular ID/organism, they are actually sequencing and presenting plasmids for this same organism as part of the paper, so it was very difficult to determine when they're discussing their new dataset(s), and when they're using this old one. I had to do a lot of digging in the supplemental files to determine which datasets were being referred to in which sections."

PMC8557374,CONCLUDING REMARKS,Other,GCF_001584335,0,0,0,?,,"  CONCLUDING REMARKS  Here we show that pLS20 constitutes the prototype of a family of related plasmids that are harboured by different Bacillus species distributed at very different geographical locations around the world. Although the plasmids share a conserved structural organization, they could be divided into four clades. Besides a variable region located in between the partition and conjugation modules, all the plasmids contain three conserved modules: a replication, a partitioning and a conjugation module. In addition, plasmids belonging to clades I and IV contain a DNA repair module that is comprised by genes uvrX and yolD, while plasmids belonging to clade II and two of the three clade III plasmids only contain a yolD gene. The very large conjugation module can be divided into two subregions. Except for one, all the other plasmids contain a 5′-located region of three genes that are responsible for controlling the activation of the conjugation pathway. This region is followed by a very large operon encoding all the genes required for the different steps of the conjugation pathway. Remarkably, the sequential steps of the conjugation process are reflected by the order of genes within the conjugation operon. Thus, the first two genes of the conjugation operon constitute a bipartite P-AT system. These two genes are followed by genes involved in the first steps of the conjugation process: selection of and attachment to a recipient cell. The regions downstream are occupied respectively by genes encoding proteins involved in steps two (generation of the T4SS), three (DNA processing) and four (conversion of single-stranded to double-stranded plasmid DNA). Comparative analysis of representative plasmids of the different clades revealed that most of the genes located in the conjugation operons are conserved in all plasmids, indicating that these perform important functions. In addition, some plasmids contain a few or several unique genes that may contribute additional features. The results of the comparative analyses are useful for future studies, not only allowing conserved and unique genes between plasmids of the pLS20 family to be differentiated, and conserved residues or regions within homologous protein to be identified, our analyses also help better understanding of the relationship between the pLS20 family plasmids and other conjugative plasmids of G+ bacteria.

PMC8557374,INTRODUCTION,Introduction,GCF_001584335,1,0,0,,,"  INTRODUCTION  Many bacteria possess autonomously replicating extrachromosomal DNA molecules named plasmids, which are composed of essential and—most often—one or more modules that are non-essential to the plasmid (1–3). In this work, we define a module as a DNA region containing all the genes and/or genetic information for performing a function or cellular process. One of the modules that is essential for all plasmids concerns a replication module responsible for regulating (initiation of) DNA replication and thereby controlling the plasmid copy number. Most plasmids replicate via the theta or the rolling-circle mechanism. Large low-copy number theta-replicating plasmids contain a segregation module whose encoded proteins ensure faithful partitioning of the plasmid during cell division. A large subset of plasmids is mobile due to the presence of a non-essential module allowing the plasmid to transfer itself horizontally to other cells via conjugation or mobilization (see below). Genes encoding virulence determinants, toxins or antibiotic resistance are often present on conjugative or mobilizable plasmids, and so can efficiently spread, causing major clinical problems and enormous economic consequences worldwide (4,5). A better understanding of the conjugation and mobilization processes is warranted to help develop drugs and strategies impeding the spread of pernicious genes by these transfer routes.  Conjugation modules comprise all the genes required for performing the following steps in the conjugation process. First, selection of and attachment to the recipient cell. Two, generation of a sophisticated translocation channel, a type IV secretion system (T4SS), connecting the donor and the recipient cells. Three, DNA processing generating the DNA form that is transferred, which in most cases is a single DNA-strand (ssDNA), and subsequent transport of the ssDNA strand through the T4SS. Finally, establishment of the transferred DNA in the recipient cell by converting the ssDNA into a double-stranded DNA molecule. Mobilizable plasmids only encode the proteins involved in the DNA processing reaction and exploit the proteins generated by a conjugative plasmid that are necessary for transfer. Because the conjugation process involves many genes, conjugative plasmids are large and use the theta type of replication during growth. Mobilizable plasmids are much smaller and can use the theta or rolling circle mechanism of replication. Conjugative elements can also be embedded in the bacterial chromosome, which are then named integrated and conjugative elements (ICE). Excellent reviews on the process of conjugation have been published elsewhere (6–13).  Conjugation occurs in both Gram-positive (G+) and Gram-negative (G-) bacteria. However, conjugative elements from G+ bacteria are less well studied than those from G− and the available information is based on a very limited number of conjugative plasmids that share little similarity between them. Although these studies have provided important insights, results on conjugation systems will have added relevance and impacts if they concern a prototype plasmid representing a family of related plasmids. For instance, comprehensive analysis of multiple related sequences may discriminate essential from non-essential genes and identify conserved regions or residues within a set of orthologous proteins that may be important for function.  The conjugative plasmid pLS20 (≈65 kb) was originally identified from the Bacillus subtilis natto strain IFO3335 (14). We chose to study pLS20 because it was the only known conjugative B. subtilis plasmid at the time we started, and its replication and partition module had already been identified and characterized (15–17). Contrary to most conjugative systems, pLS20 conjugates efficiently in both solid and liquid media (18–21). Since conjugation in liquid medium is rapid and gives very reproducible results, pLS20 is an attractive system to study conjugation. In the recent years, considerable progress has been made in understanding some aspects of the pLS20 conjugation process, particularly about mating pair formation, regulation of the conjugation genes and the DNA processing reaction (21–29).  Previously, we have shown that the 43 kb plasmid p576 from the Bacillus pumilus strain NRS576 isolated from the USA is related to pLS20 that was isolated from a B. subtilis natto strain in Japan (30–33). This suggested that pLS20 might be the prototype of a family of related plasmids. Here, we show that this is indeed the case. We have identified 35 plasmids in the public databases that are related to pLS20. The majority of these were not annotated as a plasmid but we reconstructed them from multiple contigs that are present in different next-generation sequencing (NGS) projects. All these 35 plasmids are harboured by different Bacillus species, and they could be classified into four clades. The identified plasmids have a conserved organization sharing similar origin, partitioning and conjugation modules, as well as several genes of unknown function. In addition, the majority of these pLS20 family plasmids also contain a DNA repair module. The (dis)similarities between the plasmids are analysed and discussed, providing important information for our understanding of these important and wide spread plasmids, and for future research in conjugation-related studies in general, particularly for those in G+ bacteria.

PMC8557374,MATERIALS AND METHODS,Materials and Methods,GCF_001584335,0,0,0,,,"  MATERIALS AND METHODS  Bacterial strains, plasmids and oligonucleotides  Bacterial strains were grown in Lysogeny Broth (LB) medium (34) or plated on LB plates containing 1.5% agar. When appropriate, the following antibiotics were added: ampicillin (100 μg/ml) for Escherichia coli. The strains, plasmids and oligonucleotides used are listed in Supplementary Tables S1, S2 and S3, respectively. All oligonucleotides were purchased from Isogen Life Science, The Netherlands.  DNA isolation and large plasmid screening  Bacillus strains were grown overnight at 37°C with shaking (180 RPM) in fresh LB medium in a total volume of 12 ml. The next day, 10 ml of the culture was pelleted in 5 Eppendorf tubes of 2 ml and processed as follows. Bacterial pellets were resuspended in 1 ml of Birnboim solution A (20% sucrose, 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.1, 10 mM EDTA and 50 mM NaCl) to which lysozyme was added freshly (2 mg/ml). After freezing the samples at -80°C and subsequent thawing, the tubes were incubated at 37°C with shaking during 15 min. The cells were lysed by adding 33 μl of 1% sarkosyl solution and proteinase K (100 μg/ml) to 1 ml of cell suspension and incubating the mixture at 60°C without shaking during 20 min. Next, the mixture was subjected to a phenol-chloroform extraction step and subsequently precipitated overnight in the presence of 96% ethanol. After washing with 70% ethanol solution, resulting DNA pellets were resuspended in sterile MiliQ water and treated with RNAse A. Finally, DNA samples (1–2 μl) were loaded on a 0.7% agarose gel (1× TBE buffer) without EtBr and run at 30 V for 16 h. Next, gels were stained with a 1xTBE solution containing EtBr for 2 h, followed by a destaining step and finally photographed under ultraviolet light.  Sequencing  Circularization of pBatNRS213  Plasmid pBatNRS213 was circularized as follows. A PCR was performed using total DNA extract of B. atrophaeus strain NRS213 as template DNA in combination with the outward oriented oligos oJV216 and oJV217 that hybridize near the ends of the linear contig corresponding to pBatNRS213 plasmid. The PCR product was digested with SalI and ligated into pBluescript II KS (+) vector linearized with the same restriction enzyme. The ligation mixture was used to transform competent E. coli XL-blue strain, and transformants were selected on LB agar plates supplemented with ampicillin, IPTG (1 mM) and X-gal (60 μg/ml). Some at randomly chosen colonies that had a white colour were analysed by colony PCR for the presence of an insert using oligos M13Fw-21_ext and M13-R. The positively identified derivative was named pJV40. The insert was sequenced by the Sanger method using oligos M13Fw-21_ext and M13-R.  Next-generation sequencing (NGS) of strain B. amyloliquefaciens B1895  A total DNA sample of B. amyloliquefaciens B1895 strain was used for sequence determination using the Illumina MiSeq platform. Preparation of samples and sequencing was done in collaboration with Dr Ricardo Ramos Parque Científico de Madrid (Madrid, Spain). DNA libraries were prepared with the NEBNext DNA library prep kit for Illumina (New England Biolabs). Briefly, 1 μg DNA was sonicated, and fragments of □675 or 1075 bp were selected. DNA ends were repaired, A-tailed and then ligated to adapters. Next, fragments were PCR amplified (8 cycles) and quality checked on a DNA 7500 chip on a 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent). Library sizes of 800 and 1200 bp were isolated, validated (Bioanalyzer) and titrated with quantitative PCR (qPCR). After denaturation, the libraries were seeded on a flow cell (MiSeq v2, 2×150 bp) at a density of 16 pM. Importantly, sequencing conditions were applied that resulted in in deep sequencing (∼4 Gb of sequence data). Adapters and low-quality sequences were removed (35,36). After verifying the quality of the processed data (FastQC), de novo assembly was performed using software SPAdes (mode careful active; cov-cutoff auto; k-mer sizes 21,33,55,77,99,127; other parameters set as the default parameter) (37,38). PlasmidSPAdes (same parameters as used for the previous assembly) was also used to carry out another complementary assembly to identify the extrachromosomal elements (39). The resulting assemblies were evaluated using Quast to generate summary statistics (no of contigs, total length, GC%, N50, L50) (40). The plasmid was circularized using a dedicated perl script that searches for reads within the original sequencing data that span both ends of a contig (41). For a contig to be considered circular there had to be at least three reads spanning a minimum of 60 bp of each contig end. Final SPAdes assembly was automatically annotated using the PROKKA tool 1.14.5 (42). The annotation of plasmid pBamB1895 was checked manually and names were adapted to the nomenclature used for plasmid pLS20.  Bioinformatic methods  Identification of pLS20-like plasmids in the NCBI database reference genomes  The origin of replication region of pLS20 containing all the information for autonomous DNA replication (i.e. the replication module), spanning bp 64 501 to 65 745 of pLS20cat, accession number AB615352 was used as a query to carried out a BlastN search against the NCBI RefSeq genome database (BlastN algorithm, limited to bacteria (taxid 2)). All sequences with an e-value < 2e-133 and a query cover >50% were retrieved for subsequent analysis. The hits were organized depending on whether they concerned entire plasmid sequences or contigs. The complete sequences of plasmids were aligned using the algorithm directly EMBOSS Stretcher (43) or Nucmer (44). Before aligning, the plasmids were rotated and oriented such that plasmid ended with the first base pair of the alp7A gene. The Nucmer results presented as dot plot graphics in Supplementary Figure S1 were generated using mummerplot software. In the case of contigs, all the sequences belonging to the corresponding NGS project were downloaded to identify plasmid-related contigs. For this, a TblastX search was performed against all the sequences of the NGS project using as a query the sequences of the complete plasmids pLS20, pDSYZ, pBglSRCM103574 and p576. Contigs with an e-value 0.0 were identified as part of the plasmid. Subsequently, the identified contigs were aligned against the closest related query plasmid using the program Mauve (45). Besides confirming that the contig corresponded to a plasmid sequence, this allowed ordering and orienting the contigs, resulting in partially reconstructed plasmids.  Comparative genetic maps and protein analysis  Comparative studies were performed using a set of representative plasmids whose complete or almost complete sequence was known. The representative plasmids were selected based on the phylogenetic relatedness of the plasmids and corresponded to one plasmid of each (sub)clade (see below). The homologous genes of the selected plasmids were initially detected using the tools ‘get_homologues’ or ‘Blast’ (46,47). Initially identified homologies were checked by performing global pairwise alignment to confirm and optimize global alignments between pairs of sequences. The percentages of identity obtained by pairwise alignments were used to determine whether the genes encoding the proteins were considered homologous or not: proteins were considered homologous and not homologous when their identity levels were above 30 and below 15%, respectively. Additional analyses were performed for genes encoding proteins sharing identity levels between 15 and 30% to determine whether these proteins share common features. These analyses included the prediction of (i) transmembrane domains (TMHMM server, http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TMHMM/), (ii) an N-terminal sec-dependent secretion signal (SignalP-5.0 server, http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP/), (iii) coiled coil regions (COILS server, https://embnet.vital-it.ch/software/COILS_form.html) or (iv) any conserved domains or classification to a protein family (InterProScan, www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/services/web/toolform.ebi?tool=iprscan5&sequence). In addition, proteins were screened for similar secondary structure using the Jpred server (www.compbio.dundee.ac.uk/jpred/) or possible structural relationships using the HHPred server (toolkit.tuebingen.mpg.de/tools/hhpred). Genetic maps were generated using the GenomeDiagram module (Biopython, biopython.org) and edited with Inkscape software to manually annotate and represent the homology relationships on the plasmids maps.  Phylogenetic trees  Phylogenetic trees were constructed using IQ-TREE software (48). In all cases, the IQ-TREE software was allowed to determine the substitution model to be used through the ModelFinder module (49), and the ultrafast bootstrap statistical method (1000 replicates) was applied. The root was placed at the midpoint on the unrooted generated trees. The specific conditions, parameters and statistics applied for each tree were as follows.  pLS20 family phylogenetic tree based on the replication module  This tree was constructed from an alignment generated by the MAFFT algorithm (mafft.cbrc.jp/alignment/server/) using the following settings: E-INS-i method, recommended for sequences with multiple conserved domains and long gaps and discarding the gaps. The likelihood tree was made from 35 sequences each having a length of 842 nucleotides. The model selected by ModelFinder was TPM3u + F + G4. The Log-likelihood of the tree was -4201.04.  pLS20 family phylogenetic tree based on conserved CDS of pLS20-like plasmids  This tree was constructed with the help of the get_homologues and get_phylomarkers programs (46,50). Clusters of orthologous genes (COG) detected by the get_homologues program were filtered on a pipeline in order to identify high-quality markers, whose coding DNA sequences were subsequently concatenated and used to elaborate a likelihood tree using IQ-TREE. The get_homologues program was applied using the following parameters: COG algorithm, E-value < 1e-5 and coverage > 60. The settings of the Get_phylomarkers program were as follows. IQ-TREE algorithm, k 1.0, m 0.6, T high and test all DNA models. The resulting tree was based on an alignment of 34 sequences corresponding to a concatenated 5186 long nucleotide sequence. The CDS from which the concatenated sequence of each plasmid was obtained corresponded to genes 24c (alp7A), 25 (rap), 28, 36, 38, 39, 40, 58 (rel) and 60 (according to the nomenclature of plasmid pLS20). The substitution model was GTR+F+ASC+G4. The Log-likelihood of the tree: -48326.87.  Phylogenetic tree of the Rap proteins  The MAFFT algorithm applying the following settings aligned the sequences of the Rap proteins of the seven pLS20-like plasmids analysed in the comparative study. G-INS-i method, recommended for sequences with global homology, and discarding the gaps. The likelihood tree was made from eight sequences with 386 residues. The model selected by ModelFinder was cpREV+F+I+G4. The Log-likelihood of the tree is -5289.94.  The constructed trees were used to determine (sub)clades. For this purpose, the program ‘TreeCluster’ was used, selecting the clustering method, Avg Clade, threshold 0.045 (51). This program allows defining clusters from phylogenetic trees applying the same criterion (chosen algorithm) to all the branches of the tree, which facilitates the interpretation and consistency of the clades/clusters.

Introduction,Introduction,SAMN06130135,0,1,0,,"""The first clinical isolate of H. frisingense to undergo genomic sequencing was strain VT-16–41, which was isolated from a patient with a urinary tract infection""","  1. Introduction  The genus Herbaspirillum belongs to the beta class of the phylum Proteobacteria. Thirteen species are currently assigned to this genus; they have been isolated from various environments, including water [1], the rhizosphere [2], and plant tissues [3]. Three species of this genus, Herbaspirillum frisingense, Herbaspirillum seropedicae, and Herbaspirillum rubrisubalbicans, are described as nitrogen-fixing bacteria. These bacteria can convert atmospheric nitrogen (N2) into ammonium ions (NH4+), a form that can be assimilated by plants, through the nitrogenase enzyme complex encoded by nifHDK genes [4]. These bacteria establish an endophytic association with plants of economic interest, such as wheat, corn, sugarcane, and sorghum, thereby promoting the growth of these plants through nitrogen fixation in addition to the secretion of phytohormones such as indoleacetic acid [4].  The first identification of a clinical strain belonging to the genus Herbaspirillum occurred in 1996 when bacteria previously described as Pseudomonas were reclassified as Herbaspirillum [2]. Using techniques such as DNA–DNA hybridization and labeled probes, they identified 19 clinical isolates as belonging to the genus Herbaspirillum. These isolates originated in Germany, Sweden, and the United States, the oldest isolate being identified in 1968 [2]. Recently, isolates of the genus Herbaspirillum have been found more frequently in humans, especially in samples from immunocompromised patients with cancer, sepsis, cystic fibrosis, and pneumonia not related to cystic fibrosis [5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15]. The first clinical isolate of H. frisingense to undergo genomic sequencing was strain VT-16–41, which was isolated from a patient with a urinary tract infection [16]. In another study, Spilker et al. (2008) [17] identified 28 strains of the genus Herbaspirillum in sputum from patients with cystic fibrosis. Phylogenetic analysis showed that these strains represented various species of this genus; one, an isolate of H. frisingense, was designated as strain AU14559. However, it is not entirely clear whether Herbaspirillum bacteria are opportunistic, and thus only occasionally found in clinical samples, or whether they are pathogens that can cause secondary infections and worsen the condition of patients.  In addition to strain VT-16–41, the H. frisingense genomes deposited in public databases include those of three other strains identified as GSF30, IAC152, and cluster_DBSCAN_round4_6; all of these are environmental in origin. GSF30 is the type strain of the species and has been isolated from plants of the genus Miscanthus in southern Germany [4]. IAC152 has been isolated from sugarcane roots [18]. The cluster_DBSCAN_round4_6 genome has been sequenced and assembled from the microbiome associated with the eggs of the beetle Lagria villosa, and thus has not been isolated [19]. In this work, we describe the genome of H. frisingense AU14559 isolated from sputum obtained from patients with cystic fibrosis and its comparison with the genomes of other strains of this species for which genome sequence data are available in public databases. The aim of this work was to identify the genomic characteristics that have allowed this species to infect humans.  ",FALSE,TRUE,

Genome of H. frisingense AU14559  The genome assembly of H. frisingense AU14559 was performed based on data obtained through the NGS MiSeq and Ion Proton DNA sequencing platforms. Different assemblers were used to find the best ab initio assembly. The genome assemblies of H. frisingense AU14559 were evaluated using the QUAST program; the assembly from SPAdes yielded the best results and was chosen for further analysis. This assembly had 42 contigs and an N50 of 492 kb. After automatic gap closing using the FGAP tool, seven contigs remained. These were manually closed based on comparisons with the genome of H. frisingense GSF30 until a single contig representing the entire genome was obtained. The structure and reliability of the genome was checked by mapping back the reads in the assembly. No uncovered regions or inconsistencies between the paired-end reads were found. The closed genome of H. frisingense AU14559 consists of a single DNA molecule of 5,401,391 bp with 63.1% GC content; it contains 3 rRNA operons, encodes 59 tRNAs and 23 ncRNAs, and contains 4791 protein-coding genes covering 87.5% of the total genome size.  2.2. Identification of Publicly Available H. frisingense Genomes  The H. frisingense strain AU14559 was named because of the high identity of the 16S rRNA gene with H. frisingense GSF30 [17]. To confirm that strain AU14559 belongs to the H. frisingense species and to identify other potential genomes of the species, we calculated the average nucleotide identity (ANI) between the genome of strain AU14559 and all other genomes identified as genus Herbaspirillum in GenBank (n = 76). In agreement with the result obtained by 16S rRNA gene comparison, the ANI calculation positioned the AU14559 strain genome in a cluster formed by the bacterial genomes of the H. frisingense species (Figure 1). Specifically, AU14559 was placed in a group along with H. frisingense GSF30 and H. frisingense VT-16–41. The genomic group of H. frisingense included three other genomes: H. frisingense IAC152, Herbaspirillum sp. BH-1, and Herbaspirillum sp. SG826. Two other genomes, Herbaspirillum sp. AP02 and Herbaspirillum sp. AP21, were also positioned close to the genomic group of H. frisingense; however, the ANI values for these genomes were below the 95% identity cutoff for inclusion as H. frisingense. Similarly, the genome of strain cluster_DBSCAN_round4_6, previously identified as H. frisingense, also presented an ANI value below the 95% identity cutoff. Thus, our subsequent analyses included only the six genomes that met the cutoff for consideration as H. frisingense (ANI > 95%) (Figure 1). Within this group, four environmental isolates were found, GSF30, IAC152, BH-1, and SG826, and two clinical isolates, AU14559 and VT-16–41. Interestingly, in the ANI analysis, the two clinical strains clustered with the environmental strain GSF30.  2.3. Identification of Genomic Islands in H. frisingense AU14559  The genomic comparison performed in this study suggests that there are no major differences in the genomic contents of the clinical and environmental strains. To further investigate the particularities of the genome of strain AU14559, we performed a genomic island analysis. Genomic islands are genomic regions that show some evidence of horizontal gene transfer, such as the absence of these sections in phylogenetically close individuals or pattern differences such as abnormal GC content and codon usage compared to the rest of the genome. Furthermore, the presence of genes related to horizontal gene transfer, such as genes that encode secretion systems and phage genes, can also be used as proxies for the identification of genomic islands [20,21]. The identification of possible regions arising from horizontal gene transfer was performed using the GIPSy and AlienHunter algorithms. Through the search performed by GIPSy, in which the genome of the strain H. frisingense IAC152 was used as a reference, we found a total of 14 genomic islands. GIPSy classified six of these islands (islands 3, 6, 8, 14, 25, and 32) as possible pathogenicity islands, five (islands 3, 6, 12, 19, and 20) as symbiosis islands, and three (islands 8, 20, and 27) as metabolic islands (Figure 2). Although this program also classifies islands associated with resistance, no genomic islands were classified in this category. The AlienHunter algorithm identified a total of 52 genomic islands in strain AU14559; however, most of these islands overlapped with each other or with the islands found by GIPSy. Therefore, the results of the two searches were merged, and overlapping island markings and regions that were also found in the other genomes of the species were excluded, resulting in a total of 32 possible genomic islands, GI_1 to GI_32 (Figure 2). Some of the predicted genomic islands were shared by all the studied representatives of the species, others were identified only in clinical isolates, and some were identified exclusively in AU14559.  A unique genomic island of AU14559 was GI_25, which is classified as a pathogenicity island. This island was about 46 kb and contained genes related to the type 6 secretion system (T6SS). Island GI_30 was approximately 15 kb in size and was also classified by GIPSy as a pathogenicity island. On this island, genes related to iron acquisition were found that did not have homologs in other H. frisingense strains, such as the genes encoding TonB (AU_47470 and AU_47550), ExbD (AU_47480), ExbB (AU_47480), hemolysin (AU_47500), heme binding protein (AU_47520), FecR (AU_47530), and FecI (AU_47540). When looking for common proteins among clinical isolates of the genus Herbaspirillum isolated from sputum from patients with cystic fibrosis, we found two islands that were shared with other isolates. Within island GI_26, there was a sequence that encoded 21 proteins (AU_44350-AU_44550); this sequence was also present in the clinical strain H. seropedicae AU14040 [7] but absent from the other strains of H. frisingense and H. seropedicae. These proteins are mainly involved in nucleotide metabolism and in the degradation of phenolic compounds through the protocatechuate pathway. We also identified island GI_7 representing nine proteins (AU_09530-AU_09610) that were shared with the isolate H. seropedicae AU13965; these proteins are mainly involved in energy metabolism.  Other than these two islands, the protein encoded by the AU_35290 gene that is present in island GI_22 was the only one shared (with an identity of ~70%) among the three clinical Herbaspirillum isolates; however, no genes encoding homologs of this protein were present in the genomes of the other strains of H. seropedicae and H. frisingense. This protein contains the peptidase C39 family domain, which is normally associated with the degradation of bacteriocins. To identify the bacteriocin related to this protein, a search for potential regions related to the production of bacteriocins in the genome was performed using the BAGEL4 algorithm [22]. However, no potential region of interest was found. It is possible that these genes were recently acquired from the bacterial community from which these strains were isolated. We also identified an insertion of approximately 40.2 kb originating from the phage genome and located within genomic island GI_25. This region was also present, with a coverage of between 53 and 58% in the genomes of five environmental strains of the species H. seropedicae, H. rubrisubalbicans, and H. robiniae, which show identities ranging from 81.2% to 87.4%.  2.4. Identification of Core and Accessory Genomes Using Clustering Analysis  The clinical strains of H. frisingense were isolated from sputum (AU14559) and urine (VT-16–41). These habitats were very different from the habitats from which environmental strains have been isolated, such as soil, rhizosphere, and plant tissue. This drastic difference in environments suggests, in principle, that these strains have undergone genomic adaptations that enable them to survive in different habitats. To identify the genes present in all individuals (core genome) and those unique to each strain (accessory genome), we compared the genomes of the six H. frisingense isolates with each other using the Panaroo program, a graph-based tool that uses CD-Hit, together with a neighborhood analysis, to divide the genes present in genomes into different groups according to their identities [23]. Of the 6690 different clusters created by Panaroo, 4046 were shared among all strains of H. frisingense (Figure 3). Strain AU14559 had a total of 236 unique clusters, many fewer than the 591 unique clusters in VT-16–41, the other clinical strain, and the 442 unique clusters of the environmental strain IAC152. The number of clusters shared between the two clinical strains, AU14559 and VT-16–41, was 29.  Among the genes identified as part of the core genome were some that could act in the process of colonization of both plants and humans, such as the cellulose biosynthesis operon (wss) and the cyclic b-glucan biosynthesis gene. The wss operon (AU_11910-AU_11990), composed of nine genes, was found in all genomes, and encodes proteins related to cellulose biosynthesis [24]. Bacterial cellulose is an important component that is needed for biofilm formation and, consequently, for host colonization by both plant and human pathogens [24,25]. Mutations in these genes can lead to deficiencies in biofilm formation [24]. Biofilm formation is important for the survival of pathogenic bacteria in the human body as it protects the bacteria against immunological defenses during host infection and promotes antibiotic resistance [26]. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) estimates that the percentage of human infections related to biofilm production caused by microorganisms is between 65% and 80% [27].  The AU_35540 gene encodes cyclic beta-1,2-glucan synthase; although the nucleotide sequence of this gene displayed low identity (<50%) with its homologs, the amino acid identity of the encoded protein with its counterparts in the other genomes of H. frisingense remained above 85%. This suggests that there is selective pressure for its functionality. This protein is responsible for synthesizing cyclic glucans, which have a cyclic homopolysaccharide structure formed by D-glucose molecules [28]. These molecules appear to act extracellularly to modulate the responses of animal and plant hosts [29].  Although many genes present in strain AU14559 had homologs in GSF30, some of the genes acquired by this strain are not present in environmental strains. Using kofamKOALA [30], we identified the metabolic pathways composed exclusively of genes found in the clinical isolate AU14559. We identified eight genes involved in the type VI secretion system (T6SS); these are annotated as 3 vgrG, hcP, vasD, vasK, vasF, and clpV (AU_45300, AU_45420, AU_45540, AU_45470, AU_45510, AU_45350, AU_45530, and AU_45430, respectively). This region was the same as described above for GI_25. In the analysis performed against the VFDB database, the clpV gene was also identified as a virulence factor unique to AU14559. However, when aligning the protein sequences of these genes, we observed that only the three proteins annotated as VgrG did not have homologs in the other strains of H. frisingense; the remaining five proteins were also found in the other strains, but with a protein identity of approximately 80%. The three AU14559 vgrG genes were closer in the genome in a 46,100 bp region but represented three distinct proteins (Figure S1). Although vgrG genes were not present in other H. frisingense strains, they shared high identity (~85%) with proteins found in the isolates of H. seropedicae. In the T6SS structure, the VgrG protein is a phage tail spike-like protein located at the outer end of the tube formed by the Hcp proteins, which facilitates penetration into neighboring cells [31]. All the analyzed strains possessed the type I secretion system Sec-SRP and Tat (twin-arginine translocation) and did not possess the type IV secretion system.  2.5. Plant Growth-Promoting Genes  H. frisingense, similar to H. seropedicae and H. rubrisubalbicans, has mechanisms to promote plant growth, including biological nitrogen fixation [4]. To identify the genes related to these mechanisms, we searched the genomes of H. frisingense strains for genes related to plant growth-promoting as listed by Kuramae et al. (2020) [18]. This database presents a set of bacterial genes related to interaction with plants, such as nitrogen fixation, nodulation, and phytohormones production. In addition, it has genes that can help bacterial colonization not only in animals, but also in plants, such as siderophore biosynthesis and secretion systems. Thus, this database was used to ascertain the content of these genes in the analyzed genomes. The nitrogenase enzyme complex, encoded by nifHDK genes, is responsible for the conversion of atmospheric nitrogen (N2) into ammonium (NH4+), making it assimilable by plants [4]. From the search of the database, we observed that only strain GSF30 possessed the genes that encode these enzymes; they were absent from all other strains, both clinical and environmental (Figure 4). On the other hand, all strains possessed narGH genes, allowing them to use nitrate as the final electron acceptor during oxidative phosphorylation [32]. Similarly, all strains possessed a copy of the acdS gene (1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate deaminase), which encodes the protein responsible for the conversion of 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate to ethylene, an important phytohormone that is related to the increase in biomass [33]. The phoBLS and pstABC operons, which are associated with the solubilization and transport of phosphate, respectively [34,35], were also present in all strains.  2.6. Host–Pathogen Interaction  An essential requirement for the colonization of a host, be it beneficial or pathogenic, is the interaction between the two organisms. To identify proteins that might be related to host–pathogen interactions, we subjected the predicted proteomes of the five strains to comparison with a database of virulence factors, VFDB (Figure 5a), and a database of interaction factors, PHI-base (Figure 5b). The clinical strain H. frisingense AU14559 presented a total of 73 virulence genes and was the strain with the highest number of genes in this category. However, among the virulence factors found in this analysis, only the AU_45430 gene, which aligned with the clpV1 gene from the VFDB database, was unique to AU14559. The ClpV1 protein participates in the disassembly of the injection system that forms part of the type VI secretion system (T6SS) [36]. In the genome of H. frisingense AU14559, the T6SS region, in which the clpV1 gene is inserted, was 46,100 bp in length and encoded 30 proteins. A comparison of this entire genomic region with the results obtained using the GenBank database showed that its highest level of identity was with the clinical strain H. seropedicae AU14040. H. frisingense IAC152 appeared as only the tenth best hit (Figure S1). The region that includes clpV1 is the region that displays the lowest degree of DNA–DNA homology between AU14559 and other genomes of the genus Herbaspirillum. The ClpV1 protein from AU14559, in turn, showed 92.7% identity with ClpV1 from AU14040 and only 80% identity with ClpV1 from H. frisingense VT-16–41, the best hit within the species. Taken together, these results suggest that a recombination within the T6SS region resulted in the exchange of clpV1 for a different version of the gene. Interestingly, strain VT-16–41, which is also pathogenic, presented only 67 genes that encode possible virulence factors and was the strain with the second-lowest number of genes in this category; moreover, unlike AU14559, this strain did not present any unique virulence factor. The other tested strains of H. frisingense (GSF30, BH-1, SG826, and IAC152) presented 70, 72, 69, and 65 possible genes related to virulence in their genomes, respectively, but these differences primarily reflect the differences in copy number (Figure 5a).  A feature of the high relevance for interaction with the host is the type of exopolysaccharide (EPS) produced. In H. frisingense GSF30, the probable O-antigen biosynthesis locus (OGC) has been identified and includes genes related to colitis synthesis [37]. In H. frisingense AU14559, the OGC was found in the region between 455,968 and 481,635 bp. Analysis of the nucleotide composition of the OGCs of GSF30 and AU14559 showed a DNA–DNA identity of 98.9% and identical gene compositions. However, studies of the O-antigen structure of different Herbaspirillum species and strains revealed that clinical strains AU14040 and AU13965 of H. seropedicae and strain AU14559 of H. frisingense do not contain rhamnose, unlike environmental strains [38]. To understand this phenotype, we located the rfaBrmlABC operon, which is responsible for the synthesis of rhamnose, in the genomes of clinical and environmental strains of H. frisingense. In that analysis, we found that the second gene in the operon, identified as rmlA, was mutated, creating a premature stop codon (Figure S2). Although the rmlBC genes were intact, it is possible that this mutation inactivates the entire rhamnose biosynthesis operon. In BH-1, we also identified a mutation, but in this case, the mutation was in the first gene of the operon. The other strains, including the VT-16–41 clinical strain, possessed the complete operon.  Through alignments with the PHI-base database, we identified a total of 199 genes in H. frisingense AU14559 that may be involved in host–pathogen interactions; however, none of these genes were found exclusively in this strain. The genomes of VT-16–41, IAC152, BH-1, GSF30, and SG826 presented 195, 194, 197, 195, and 197 occurrences, respectively, against proteins in this database (Figure 5b).  2.7. Antibiotic Resistance Genes in H. frisingense  Antibiotic resistance is a feature that has become increasingly common in clinical isolates. Many resistance genes have already been mobilized in plasmids and are thus able to circulate among species in a hospital environment [39,40]. To identify genes potentially involved in antibiotic resistance mechanisms, we compared representatives of each of the clusters obtained by Panaroo from each of the five strains with the HMM profile of cured proteins from the Resfams database (core v1.2). Strain AU14559 possessed a total of 19 genes that are potentially involved in resistance (Figure 6). Strains VT-16–41, IAC152, BH-1, GSF30, and SG826 possessed 24, 21, 22, 24, and 20 proteins, respectively, that are potentially involved in antibiotic resistance. The main mechanism of action of resistance proteins encoded by the genome of strain AU14559 was drug efflux; its genome encoded nine RND efflux proteins (RND efflux, adeC-adeK-oprM, mexE, and mexX) and seven ABC efflux proteins (ABC efflux, macB and msbA). All the analyzed strains had 2 class A beta-lactamase genes belonging to the same cluster and a 1 class B beta-lactamase gene. In addition to these beta-lactamase genes, strain IAC152 had one additional class A beta-lactamase gene that was in a different cluster according to Panaroo’s analysis; this demonstrates that this gene is not an extra copy of another gene but that it encodes an enzyme that differs from the enzymes present in the other genomes of the species. Likewise, strain VT-16–41 possessed two genes that encode RND efflux proteins (RND_efflux and mexE), an MsbA protein that is involved in ABC efflux; however, the genes that encode these proteins were divided into two clusters by Panaroo. One of the clusters was present in VT-16–41 and IAC152, and the other was present in the other strains.  The results obtained in this analysis, as well as the results of the analysis of virulence genes, showed a very similar profile among the strains; in most cases, the strains varied only in the number of proteins in each family present. The exceptions were two unique genes present in the GSF30 environmental strain, those encoding aminoglycoside phosphotransferase (APH3) and those encoding chloramphenicol acetyltransferase. It is notable that there are many resistance genes associated with this species, even considering the environmental strains.  The presence of resistance genes in both clinical and environmental strains of H. frisingense raised the hypothesis that this is a common feature of the genus Herbaspirillum. To answer this question, we submitted all genomes of the genus Herbaspirillum (n = 76) to the same analysis performed for H. frisingense. The result of comparing these genomes with Resfams revealed that the antibiotic resistance genes found in H. frisingense were dispersed across the genus (Figure S3). In some isolates, we identified classes C and D beta-lactamases, in contrast to H. frisingense, which only had classes A and B. Interestingly, the isolates that had beta-lactamases class C and D did not have class A and B. Additionally, we found several genes identified as vanS. The vanS/R genes conditioned a two-component system that acted on vancomycin resistance, where VanS encodes a transcriptional activator.

The ANIs were calculated by the pyani pipeline after aligning the regions present in all genomes of the genus Herbaspirillum through the Mummer. Genomes with ANI higher than 95% can be considered to belong to the same species; this identified the AU14559 isolate, as well as the strains Herbaspirillum sp.BH-1 and Herbaspirillum sp.SG826, as belonging to the species Herbaspirillum frisingense.

Discussion,Results and Discussion,SAMN06130135,1,0,0,,"""Through our ANI analysis, we identified five genomes of the species H. frisingense that have been deposited in the GenBank database; four of these were environmental, and one was clinical. ""","  3. Discussion  The emergence of new, opportunistic pathogens is a serious public health problem. The isolation of bacteria, which were initially described as environmental, in clinical samples such as blood, urine, and sputum has become increasingly common and distributed in different countries (Figure S4). Among these emerging bacteria, the genus Herbaspirillum makes a considerable contribution. Described in 1986 [2] as a bacterium that can endophytically associate with grasses such as rice and corn, in recent years several clinical strains of various species belonging to this genus have been isolated. Herbaspirillum seropedicae, Herbaspirillum  frisingense, and Herbaspirillum huttiense are examples of species that have clinical isolates. In this work, we describe the sequencing and comparison of the genome of a new clinical strain of Herbaspirillum frisingense designated AU14559. The type strain of H. frisingense, GSF30, was described in 2001 as an environmental bacterium capable of biological nitrogen fixation [41]. Through our ANI analysis, we identified five genomes of the species H. frisingense that have been deposited in the GenBank database; four of these were environmental, and one was clinical. The search for genes related to biological nitrogen fixation was negative for all strains except the GSF30 type strain. Even the IAC152, BH-1, and SG826 strains, which were isolated from the environment, did not possess the genes necessary to perform biological nitrogen fixation. The high degree of identity among the proteins encoded by the nif clusters of H. frisingense, H. seropedicae, and H. rubrisubalbicans suggests that this cluster was acquired by an ancestral species via HGT [4]. The absence of the nif cluster indicates that this apparatus is still evolving and is not fixed in the species. Loss of the nif cluster has also been described in two other clinical isolates of H. seropedicae [42].  Exopolysaccharide (EPS) and lipopolysaccharide are important components of the bacterial cell membrane. In H. seropedicae it was shown that rhamnose has a high influence on the capacity of these bacteria to colonize maize roots. Rhamnose biosynthesis mutants showed a 100-fold reduction in adhesion and colonization [43]. According to Antunes et al., the clinical strains H. frisingense AU14559, H. seropedicae AU14040, and Herbaspirillum lineage 3 do not present rhamnose in their EPS, but all other species and strains analyzed do [38]. One possible hypothesis we suggest here is that this difference may be due to the action of the immune system. Park and Nahm showed that rhamnose is an important part of the immunodominant epitope in people immunized with the pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23) [44], and Oyelaran and colleagues showed that human serum has a high titre of anti-alpha rhamnose antibodies [45]. Added to this is the fact that humans do not use or have rhamnose associated with their glycome [46]. It is possible that the bacteria that mutated and lost the ability to synthesize rhamnose, and therefore add it to their exo or lipopolysaccharide, were selected while the others were eliminated by an immune response.  The ability to acquire iron from the environment is extremely important for pathogenic bacteria. Iron acts as a co-factor in several metabolic reactions by coordinating enzymatic complexes. However, its bioavailability in the human body is low, and this makes it necessary for pathogens to maximize their ability to remove iron from the environment. In our study, we observed that the clinical strain AU14559 possessed additional genes for iron capture and transport, exemplified by TonB transporters. An important mechanism for extracellular iron capture is the production of siderophores, low-molecular-weight molecules with a high affinity for iron. Siderophores are synthesized by large enzyme complexes, usually those belonging to the non-ribosomal peptide synthetase group. Both clinical and environmental strains of H. seropedicae can produce siderophore serobactins. However, the gene encoding serobactin is not present in any strain of H. frisingense.  Core genome analysis revealed the presence of three vgrG genes unique to AU14559 among the genomes of H. frisingense. The VgrG protein is part of the T6SS and, together with PAAR, is responsible for the contact with neighboring cells [47]. A study conducted on Serratia marcescens showed that different VgrG homologues are associated with different effector proteins secreted by T6SS [48]. The region where these genes were identified was classified as a pathogenic island (GI_25). Despite not having a similarity with other H. frisingense genomes, GI_25 has a similarity with the genomes of clinical and environmental strains of H. seropedicae, with the clinical strain of H. huttiense, and with strains of H. rubrisubalbicans, considered a phytopathogen for some sugarcane crops [49]. The GI_25 is flanked upstream by a transponsase in addition to presenting regions with a sharp drop in GC content (Figure 2 and Figure S1). It is possible that these genomic features facilitate the recombination process.  The genome of H. frisingense AU14559 differs from that of the environmental isolate H. frisingense GSF30 in ways such as the loss of nif genes in addition to the acquisition of other genes. However, it also has several characteristics in common with the environmental strain that may be involved in its resilience in the host; these include the fact that the secretion systems of the two strains are identical, most of their virulence and interaction factors are similar, both possess genes such as the gene that encodes the protein responsible for the synthesis of cyclic beta-1,2-glucan, which is involved in the evasion of the human immune system and is a requirement for intracellular survival of other pathogens [50], and both possess the wss operon, which may be involved in biofilm production [51], an important strategy employed by pathogens for survival in the human body.  Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in bacteria is a serious public health problem. According to the World Health Organization, AMR will be the leading cause of death worldwide in 2050 [52]. Antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) are increasingly common in the hospital environment [52], as is the identification of bacteria that have been previously described as environmental. In a previous study, we found that Elizabethkingia bacteria, initially isolated from soil, occupy the tenth position in the number of ARGs/genomes among bloodstream infection isolates [53]. Contrary to what might be expected, both clinical and environmental strains of H. frisingense share a high number of ARGs that are capable of conferring resistance to antibiotics of various classes. The resistance mechanism with the highest number of ARGs identified was drug efflux. Recently, our group carried out a study involving thousands of genomes of bacteria isolated from blood and we identified efflux pumps as one of the main resistance mechanisms [53]. However, the specificity of efflux systems still needs to be better elucidated. Some channels have known specificity to certain classes of drugs such as macB, which is an ABC transporter that confers resistance to macrolides [54], whereas RND transporters seem to have a lower specificity and are able to transport several classes of drugs [55]. An antibiogram analysis of the uropathogenic strain H. frisingense VT-16–41 (NCBI Biosample, accession number SAMN06130135) revealed that it is resistant to 11 different antibiotics. Considering that these genes are shared among different strains, it is possible that this profile extends to other strains. Antibiotic resistance was not deeply studied in the genus Herbaspirillum until the first clinical isolates emerged. However, when clinical strains began to be isolated and antibiogram tests began to be performed, it was possible to determine that the resistance profiles of these clinical isolates generally encompass more than three antibiotics of different classes; this classifies them as multidrug resistant (MDR) [56]. In addition, many of these clinical isolates of Herbaspirillum have intrinsic resistance against colistin, an antibiotic of last resort [5,14,57].  The microbiota present in the rhizosphere are extremely important in plant development; they influence nutrient acquisition, hormone production, and the defense against plant pathogens. This microbiota are also the main source of environmental bacteria for the human microbiome, modulating our own microbial diversity through food [58]. However, ingestion of these bacteria, together with raw vegetables, acts as a source of dissemination of resistance genes for humans, which are mainly derived from nonpathogenic bacteria present in the soil [58,59,60]. With the domestication of plants of economic interest, human action also influences the diversity of these microbiota and the functional composition of their genes, especially in organic farming, where sewage sludge and animal manure can be used as fertilizers [61,62] and where the number of resistance genes is significantly higher than that present in plants produced through conventional cultivation [63].  The results presented in this work are of particular importance considering that H. frisingense GSF30, as well as H. seropedicae and H. rubrisubalbicans, is widely used as a biofertilizer in grass crops [25]. We must evaluate the possibility that H. frisingense has the potential to colonize and infect a variety of hosts. This may be because the “native” environment of these bacteria, the rhizosphere, facilitates the emergence of opportunistic bacteria [64]. Cell adhesion and cytotoxicity studies with the environmental strain H. seropedicae SmR1 and the clinical strains H. huttiense spp. huttiense AU11883 and H. frisingense AU14559 showed that the clinical strains can adhere to lung Calu-3 cells. Furthermore, the treatment of Calu-3 cells with the strain AU14559 secretome led to drastic changes in cell morphology [65]. The rhizosphere is a nutrient-rich environment due to the exudates released by the plants, and this generates great competition between the bacteria present in this environment and thus acts as a selection factor for cells with more efficient nutrient and mineral uptake mechanisms; this is a common feature among human pathogens. This competitive environment often also makes it necessary for bacteria to develop defense mechanisms against other microorganisms, both through the production of defenses with the acquisition of antibiotic resistance genes and through the production of antibiotics and the infection of other eukaryotic organisms present in their environment, such as fungi and protozoa. These characteristics, together with the presence of genes that affect bacteria–plant interactions and may also be associated with bacteria–human interactions, may contribute to the recent cases in which H. frisingense has been identified in clinical samples.

Purification and Sequencing of Genomic DNA  H. frisingense AU14559 cells were grown overnight in NFbHP medium [66] at 37 °C until the culture reached an O.D. 600 nm of 0.8. Genomic DNA was purified using the phenol chloroform method [67], and the genome was sequenced in a hybrid strategy using the MiSeq paired-end 2 × 300 bp (Illumina Inc., Foster City, CA, USA) and Ion Proton single-end 1 × 200 bp (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA, USA) platforms.  4.2. Genome Assembly  The H. frisingense AU14559 genome was assembled individually and in a combined manner using the results obtained from the different sequencing platforms using Newbler v2.9 assemblers (454 Life Sciences, Branford, CT, USA), SPAdes v3.10.0 [68] and CLC assembler v10 (Qiagen). The assemblies were evaluated using the QUAST (Quality Assessment Tool for Genome Assemblies) algorithm [69] to choose the best automatic assembly. The contigs were then sorted using the genome of H. frisingense GSF30, the closest genome to strain AU14559, as a reference. As the genome of strain GSF30 was not closed, its contigs were ordered using the genome of Herbaspirillum seropedicae SmR1, the most closely related species with a closed genome, as a reference by visualizing the contigs in the Artemis Comparison Tool (ACT) [70]. Gap closure was performed using the algorithms FGAP [71] and GFnisher [72] and by manual inspection, looking for regions of similarity at the ends of the contigs and in assemblies performed by other assemblers using the BLASTN algorithm [73]. To validate the assembly, all reads were mapped onto the assembled genome with the purpose of identifying regions without coverage and inconsistencies in the genome. The closed genome was annotated using the Prokka algorithm that coordinates other tools to provide a complete genome annotation (ncRNA, tRNA, rRNA, and CDSs) [74]. The ncRNAs (non-coding RNA) were identified by Infernal using the RNA Families database (RFam) as reference and considering the RNA secondary structure.  4.3. Genome Comparisons  All publicly available genomes of the genus Herbaspirillum were retrieved and compared by calculating the average nucleotide identity (ANI) using the pyani pipeline [75]. Similarities and divergences were investigated using a genome–genome alignment performed using BLASTN [73] and visualized using ACT [70] and BRIG [76] software. The genes present in the clinical strain and absent from the environmental strains were further investigated with respect to their function, the domains present in their encoded proteins, and their relationship with interaction and resilience in humans. This process was performed using the BLASTP algorithm [77] and the Pfam database [78] and searches in PubMed. Possible horizontal gene transfer regions were determined by GIPSy software [79] using the genome of H. frisingense IAC152 as a reference and using Alien Hunter [80] without the use of a reference genome.  The genomes of the strains identified by the ANI calculation as belonging to H. frisingense were re-annotated by the Prokka algorithm [74] to standardize the CDS annotations. The resulting genes from each of these annotations, together with the genes from the H. frisingense strain AU14559, were then clustered using Panaroo [23] using a family threshold of 50% identity and length difference cutoff of 0.95.  To identify virulence and host–pathogen interaction factors in the analyzed genomes, the BLASTP algorithm [77] was used to perform an alignment of searches of the representatives of the clusters resulting from the analysis with Panaroo against the core dataset (only proteins verified experimentally) from the VFDB database (Virulence Factors DataBase) [81] and PHI-base (Pathogen Host Interactions database) [82]. For both searches in the databases, a cutoff of 50% identity, an e-value of 10-6, and a minimum coverage of 90% were used. Proteins from groups present exclusively in the clinical strain AU14559 were inserted into the KofamKOALA [30] tool to identify the metabolic pathways in which they are involved. Possible phage regions incorporated into the genome were identified using PHASTER [83]. To search for genes that confer resistance to antibiotics, the algorithm HMmer v3.3.2 [84] was used, searching for the proteins representing the clusters in an HMM profile of the cured bank of antibiotic resistance genes, ResFams (Core v1.2) [85]. Potential bacteriocin-coding regions were searched using BAGEL4 [22].  4.4. Prospecting for Plant Growth-Promoting Genes  From the list of genes compiled and classified by Kuramae et al. (2020) [18], CDSs in fasta format were programmatically extracted from the REST API of the UniProt database [86]. The created multifasta (amino acid) file was used to identify plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria genes (PGPRGs) (S-1). The CDSs were then aligned using the BLASTP program [77] against the Panaroo counterpart clusters. PGPRGs were considered as matches when they covered 80% of a cluster with an average identity of 50%.  ",FALSE,TRUE,

Regarding AMR, we found several antibiotic resistance genes distributed among all strains, including genes encoding class A and class B beta-lactamases. The antibiogram profile determined for the uropathogenic strain and the high identity among homologs in the different strains suggest that these genes are functional and that the profile is shared. Furthermore, we showed that all strains other than the type strain have lost the ability to fix nitrogen, but have retained other genes that are important for host interaction. Our data suggest that these bacteria present a pre-adaptation to different hosts and reinforce the notion that bacteria that interact with one host are more likely than free-living bacteria to colonize another host.

PMC8614823,Abstract,Abstract,SAMN06130135,1,0,0,,,"  The genus Herbaspirillum is widely studied for its ability to associate with grasses and to perform biological nitrogen fixation. However, the bacteria of the Herbaspirillum genus have frequently been isolated from clinical samples. Understanding the genomic characteristics that allow these bacteria to switch environments and become able to colonize human hosts is essential for monitoring emerging pathogens and predicting outbreaks. In this work, we describe the sequencing, assembly, and annotation of the genome of H. frisingense AU14559 isolated from the sputum of patients with cystic fibrosis, and its comparison with the genomes of the uropathogenic strain VT-16–41 and the environmental strains GSF30, BH-1, IAC152, and SG826. The genes responsible for biological nitrogen fixation were absent from all strains except for GSF30. On the other hand, genes encoding virulence and host interaction factors were mostly shared with environmental strains. We also identified a large set of intrinsic antibiotic resistance genes that were shared across all strains. Unlike other strains, in addition to unique genomic islands, AU14559 has a mutation that renders the biosynthesis of rhamnose and its incorporation into the exopolysaccharide unfeasible. These data suggest that H. frisingense has characteristics that provide it with the metabolic diversity needed to infect and colonize human hosts.  ",FALSE,FALSE,

HS-SPME was applied as an extraction method for volatiles. Dill ether is the most abundant constituent of A. graveolens essential oils, and it was found in sufficient quantities in all studied parts of the plant. A comparison of different parts revealed that A. graveolens seed oils exhibited the most potent antimicrobial activity when compared to the other parts of the plant. This could be attributed to the presence of the highest content of carvone and its precursor limonene in seed essential oil.

Myrcene, α-phellandrene, p-cymene, limonene, dill ether, carvone and dill apiole were found to be common components of A. graveolens plant seeds, flowers, leaves and stems essential oils. Dill ether is the most abundant constituent of A. graveolens essential oils, and it is found in sufficient quantities in all parts; 46.9, 33.3, 16.0, and 31.9% in flowers, seeds, leaves, and stems, respectively. The second main volatile component of A. graveolens essential oils were α-phellandrene, which was found in adequate quantities in flowers (2.9%), seeds (traces), leaves (6.1%) and stems (1.1%).  It is well established that essential oils are generally effective against many microorganisms, including bacteria and fungi. As typical lipophiles, they disrupt the structure of the cytoplasmic membrane and permeabilize it. In bacteria, membrane permeabilization is associated with the loss of ions and reduction of membrane potential (Bakkali et al., 2008; Sikkema et al., 1994). In this context, the present work was carried out to compare and investigate the activity of A. graveolens essential oils isolated from different parts against various strains of bacteria and fungi, the positive results will confirm the folkloric use of A. graveolens for curing many infectious diseases.  Our results show that A. graveolens oil samples (seeds, flowers, leaves and stems) exhibited good antimicrobial activities against the tested microorganisms (Table 2). Data analysis showed that the essential oil isolated from A. graveolens seeds exhibited the highest antimicrobial activity compared to other essential oils isolated from other parts of the same plant, followed by flowers, leaves and stems. Previous findings showed that essential oils rich with carvone and limonene usually exhibit strong antimicrobial activity (Delaquis et al., 2002; Singh et al., 2002). Taking this into account, one can expect good antimicrobial potential of A. graveolens essential oil in which carvone and its precursor limonene are the major constituents. This was proven by the antimicrobial assay of these samples, in which they showed superior activities when compared to control antimicrobials. The highest activity was observed against the S. aureus strain, with a diameter of inhibition equal to 25.0 ± 0.00 mm, followed by B. licheniformis, with a diameter of inhibition of 22.0 ± 1.60 mm, compared to gentamicin and tetracycline. Interestingly, all tested A. graveolens essential oil samples showed stronger antifungal activity against A. parasiticus than the control antifungal itraconazole (Table 2). These results are consistent with data previously reported that essential oils extracted from dill plants exhibit antifungal activity (Kaivan et al., 2016; Yuxin et al., 2013; Jun et al., 2012). To our knowledge, this is the first report with comparable testing of different parts of Saudi A. graveolens essential oils (seeds, flowers, leaves and stems) against different pathogenic microorganisms.

PMC8920927,Introduction,Introduction,CP011526,0,0,0,,,"  1  Introduction  Anethum graveolens L. (AG) is an important aromatic annual herb that is widely used as a spice in addition to its well-known carminative, stomachic and diuretic applications. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which is distributed in Southwest Asia and the Mediterranean and is native to Southeast Europe. It is commonly known as dill in English and “Shabat شبت” in Arabic (Navneet et al., 2019). It has been cultivated since ancient times and found to be closely related to the species of Indian dill (A. sowa) and European dill (A. graveolens). Mediterranean countries in Eastern Europe, India and Russia are the main producers of dill essential oil (Henry et al., 2015).  The seeds of A. graveolens are used in folk medicine as an appetizer, carminative, diuretic, stomachic, digestive, sedative and in hemorrhoids (Jana and Shekhawat, 2010; Singh et al., 2005). Chewing of the seeds improves bad breath, e.g., halitosis. A. graveolens stimulates milk flow in lactating/nursing mothers and is often given to livestock for this reason. It also cures mental disorders, urinary infections and piles (Zheng et al., 1992). This plant is one of the additives used in gripe water usually given for relief of colic pain and hiccups in babies/infants and flatulence in young children (Nautiyal and Tiwari., 2011). Furthermore, it is used as a natural flavor enhancer in many food items, particularly in sauces, salads, soups, sea foods, fried meats and mainly in pickles. The essential oil is extracted from leaves, seeds and stems and is used as a flavoring agent in food and beverages due to its pleasant aroma. Additionally, the essential oil is used as perfume to aromatize soaps, detergents and cosmetics (Leopold et al., 2003).  Phytochemical screening of this plant showed that its flowers, seeds, leaves and stems were rich in polyphenols, tannins, terpenes, and cardiac and flavonoid glycosides (Singh et al., 2005; Nautiyal and Tiwari., 2011). Various pharmacological activities have been reported from A. graveolens plant parts, such as antihypercholesterolemic, chemopreventive effects, antimicrobial, antioxidant, antihyperlipidemic, antiulcer, mucosal protective, antisecretory, anticancer, antidiabetic, anti-inflammatory, insecticidal and analgesic activities (Zheng et al., 1992).  The A. graveolens volatile oil was reported to have numerous pharmacological activities, including antioxidant (El Mansouri et al., 2016), anticancer (Mohammed et al., 2018), antibacterial, antifungal and antimicrobial activities (Chahal et al., 2017), diuretic (Sahib et al., 2012), antidiabetic (Goodarzi et al., 2016), and anti-inflammatory & analgesic (Naseri et al., 2012) activities. The essential oil of A. graveolens seeds growing in Saudi Arabia were analyzed using HS-SPME and reported previously (Al-Massarani et al., 2018). To the best of our knowledge, no previous study has been conducted to compare the essential oil content of different parts of A. graveolens growing in Saudi Arabia using HS-SPME. The aim of our study was to evaluate and compare the volatile oil profiles of the flowers, seeds, leaves and stems of A. graveolens growing in Saudi Arabia and to determine the antimicrobial activities of each of these parts.  The headspace solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME) technique is a relatively new method for the extraction of volatiles, was developed in 1993 and has attracted growing attention over the past decade. It utilizes a fine quartz fiber with a polymeric coating to extract organic compounds from its matrix and directly transfer them into the injector of a gas chromatograph for thermal desorption and analysis. HS-SPME is designed to extract volatile compounds with a wide range of boiling points without forming artifacts. In the current work, the essential oils of the seeds, flowers, leaves and stems of Saudi A. graveolens plants were separately extracted using HS-SPME and analyzed using GC/MS. Subsequently, the antimicrobial capacity of each essential oil sample was evaluated against various bacterial and fungal strains.  ",FALSE,TRUE,

In March 2019, the seeds, flowers, stems, and leaves were carefully separated and then dried in the shade. It was identified by plant taxonomist Dr. Rajakrishnan Rajagopal, a botanist of the Science College Herbarium, King Saud University. A voucher specimen (#24547) was deposited in the herbarium of the College of Science, KSU. All protocols involving plants adhered to relevant ethical guidelines/regulations of King Saud University (Article #14).  2.2  Headspace solid-phase microextraction  Plant materials were placed in a 5 ml headspace vial and enriched for 1 h on a SPME fiber (PDMS/DVB/Carboxen, SUPELCO part no. 57298-U) at a temperature of 80 °C in a metal block in such a way that the plant material was subjected to the elevated temperature while the SPME fiber was kept cold (room temperature). The enriched fiber was placed in the GC injector, and the fiber desorbed for 1 min at 250 °C.  2.3  GC–FID and GC–MS analysis  Gas chromatography–flame ionization detector (GC–FID) and GC–MS analyses were performed in one run using an MS-FID-splitter consisting of a quartz Y-splitter, a short (ca. 20 cm) 0.1 mm id fused silica restrictor column as an inlet to the GC–MS interface, and a ca. A 1 m × 0.25 mm deactivated fused silica column served as a transfer line to the FID detector. The restrictor column was used to limit the MS vacuum flow and prevent the insertion of combustion gases from the FID, which operated at atmospheric pressure. Moreover, the analytical column flow had to be greater than the inflow to the MS detector, which was limited to approximately 1 mL/min by the restriction line. The GC column flow should also be constant; otherwise, the FID/MS split ratio would change with temperature. This configuration yielded an FID and MS chromatogram with almost identical retention times (RTs), thus facilitating the assignment of FID peaks to each substance. The Thermo Fisher Scientific Trace GC Ultra used a split/split less injector heated at 250 °C and connected to a 50 m × 0.25 mm × 1.0 μm SE-52 (95% polydimethylsiloxane, 5% polydiphenylsiloxane) capillary column (prepared and tested for deactivation and separation efficiency in our lab, Kurt, 1986), an FID detector operating at 250 °C, and a TriPlus RSH Autosampler.  For essential oil component identification, a Thermo Fisher Scientific ISQ mass spectrometer connected with a GC/MS interface heated at 250 °C was used in electron ionization mode at 70 eV and a filament at 50 μA. Furthermore, an ion source operating at 230 °C and a scan range of 40–500 amu. The oven temperature use gradient program involved heating for 1 min at 60 °C, then heating increased to 230 °C at a rate of 3 °C/min, and a 230 °C isotherm for 12.3 min. The carrier gas was helium and flowed at a constant rate of 1.5 mL/min.  2.4  Identification of the essential oil components  Thermo Xcalibur 2.2 software was used to identify the EO compounds by correlating the obtained mass spectra with the databases of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (The NIST 08), Wiley 8th ed (Wiley Registry™), Adams library (Robert, 2007), Mass Finder terpenoids library, and our own library. However, the mass spectra's simple comparison is not sufficient for a clear identification, especially for sesquiterpenes. Thus, the chromatogram position was also considered a second criterion determined by comparing the calculated retention indices (RIs) of the peaks with the corresponding literature data (Wiley Registry™ & The NIST 08) or reference compounds. The RI values were determined by measuring the RTs of a series of n-alkanes that were eluted across the entire chromatogram and were calculated according to the method of Van den Dool and Kratz (Van and Kratz 1963). Moreover, the EO components were quantified using normalized peak area calculations of the FID chromatogram without (by first approximation) relative FID-response factors.  2.5  Antibacterial assay  Agar diffusion methods were used in this study to assay the antibacterial activity of the essential oils against 9 different microbial strains, including Gram-positive; Staphylococcus aureus (CP011526.1), Bacillus licheniformis (KX785171.1) and Listeria innocua (DSM, 20649) and the Gram-negative; Enterobacter xiangfangensis (CP017183.1), Escherichia fergusonii (CU928158.2) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (NR-117678.1) bacterial strains. TSB tryptone soya broth media were used previously to grow the microorganisms as mentioned above for 24 h. Nutrient agar plates were used to distribute 0.1 mL of the microbial suspensions. Ten and 20 μl of each essential oil were spotted on the inoculated plates. Under sterile conditions and after 15 min, plates were incubated under optimal growth conditions for each strain. The free area without microbial growth was measured three times to detect the diameter of the zone of inhibition, and the mean was calculated. Gentamycin (10 μg) and tetracycline (10 μg) were used as positive controls, while DMSO was used as a negative control.  2.6  Antifungal activity  All essential oils were tested for their antifungal activity using the broth microdilution method according to Gong and Guo (Gong and Guo, 2009). The activity was tested against three pathogenic fungi: Candida albicans (MF942350), Candida parapsilosis (MF942354) and Aspergillus parasiticus (CBS 100926). One hundred microliters of the sample solutions was smeared in an SDA plate with approximately 3 × 106 colony-forming units (CFU) mL−1, followed by incubation at 37 °C for 1 day. The zone of inhibition diameters (in mm) was measured, and the rates of growth inhibition were obtained according to the following formula taking into consideration ±SD as the means:%Growth inhibition rate = (dc − ds)/(dc − d0) × 100where dc is the diameter of the untreated control fungus, ds is the diameter of the sample-treated fungus and d0 is the diameter of the fungus cut.  The experiment was carried out in three independent replicates, and the result is the average with standard deviation. Itraconazole was used as the positive control, and DMSO was used as the negative control.  2.7  Statistical analysis  Data analysis was expressed as the mean ± standard deviation (SD) of three replicates. The data were subjected to one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Based on Microsoft Excel 2010 statistical package analyses, the significant differences were considered statistically significant values p < 0.05.  ",TRUE,TRUE,

Structures of major constituents present in the essential oils of A. graveolens seeds, flowers, leaves and stems are illustrated Figure 2.Figure 2Structures of major constituents in essential oils of A. graveolens seeds, flowers, leaves and stems.Figure 2  The essential oils of A. graveolens samples (seeds, flowers, leaves and stems) were tested for antimicrobial activity against gram-positive, such as S. aureus (CP011526.1), B. licheniformis (KX785171.1), and L. innocua (DSM, 20649), and gram-negative, such as E. xiangfangensis (CP017183.1), E. fergusonii (CU928158.2) and P. aeruginosa (NR-117678.1). In addition to the three pathogenic fungi C. albicans (MF942350), C. parapsilosis (MF942354) and A. parasiticus (CBS 100926), as shown in Table 2. The oil from seeds at 20 μL exhibited the highest antimicrobial activity. The best activity was observed against the S. aureus strain, with a diameter of inhibition equal to 25.0 ± 0.00, 17.0 ± 0.10, and 15.0 ± 1.10 mm for the essential oil isolated from seeds, flowers and leaves, respectively. This strain had a lower sensitivity to the essential oil isolated from stems (11.0 ± 0.6 mm) compared to the antibiotic tetracycline. The halos of inhibition for B. licheniformis (22.0 ± 1.60 and 18.0 ± 1.90 mm) by the essential oils from seeds and flowers, respectively, were greater than those of the remaining samples.

Dill ether is the most abundant constituent of A. graveolens essential oils, and it was found in sufficient quantities in all studied parts of the plant. A comparison of different parts revealed that A. graveolens seed oils exhibited the most potent antimicrobial activity when compared to the other parts of the plant. This could be attributed to the presence of the highest content of carvone and its precursor limonene in seed essential oil.

Myrcene, α-phellandrene, p-cymene, limonene, dill ether, carvone and dill apiole were found to be common components of A. graveolens plant seeds, flowers, leaves and stems essential oils. Dill ether is the most abundant constituent of A. graveolens essential oils, and it is found in sufficient quantities in all parts; 46.9, 33.3, 16.0, and 31.9% in flowers, seeds, leaves, and stems, respectively. The second main volatile component of A. graveolens essential oils were α-phellandrene, which was found in adequate quantities in flowers (2.9%), seeds (traces), leaves (6.1%) and stems (1.1%).  It is well established that essential oils are generally effective against many microorganisms, including bacteria and fungi. As typical lipophiles, they disrupt the structure of the cytoplasmic membrane and permeabilize it. In bacteria, membrane permeabilization is associated with the loss of ions and reduction of membrane potential (Bakkali et al., 2008; Sikkema et al., 1994). In this context, the present work was carried out to compare and investigate the activity of A. graveolens essential oils isolated from different parts against various strains of bacteria and fungi, the positive results will confirm the folkloric use of A. graveolens for curing many infectious diseases.  Our results show that A. graveolens oil samples (seeds, flowers, leaves and stems) exhibited good antimicrobial activities against the tested microorganisms (Table 2). Data analysis showed that the essential oil isolated from A. graveolens seeds exhibited the highest antimicrobial activity compared to other essential oils isolated from other parts of the same plant, followed by flowers, leaves and stems. Previous findings showed that essential oils rich with carvone and limonene usually exhibit strong antimicrobial activity (Delaquis et al., 2002; Singh et al., 2002). Taking this into account, one can expect good antimicrobial potential of A. graveolens essential oil in which carvone and its precursor limonene are the major constituents. This was proven by the antimicrobial assay of these samples, in which they showed superior activities when compared to control antimicrobials. The highest activity was observed against the S. aureus strain, with a diameter of inhibition equal to 25.0 ± 0.00 mm, followed by B. licheniformis, with a diameter of inhibition of 22.0 ± 1.60 mm, compared to gentamicin and tetracycline. Interestingly, all tested A. graveolens essential oil samples showed stronger antifungal activity against A. parasiticus than the control antifungal itraconazole (Table 2). These results are consistent with data previously reported that essential oils extracted from dill plants exhibit antifungal activity (Kaivan et al., 2016; Yuxin et al., 2013; Jun et al., 2012). To our knowledge, this is the first report with comparable testing of different parts of Saudi A. graveolens essential oils (seeds, flowers, leaves and stems) against different pathogenic microorganisms.

PMC8920927,Introduction,Introduction,CP017183,0,0,0,,,"  1  Introduction  Anethum graveolens L. (AG) is an important aromatic annual herb that is widely used as a spice in addition to its well-known carminative, stomachic and diuretic applications. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which is distributed in Southwest Asia and the Mediterranean and is native to Southeast Europe. It is commonly known as dill in English and “Shabat شبت” in Arabic (Navneet et al., 2019). It has been cultivated since ancient times and found to be closely related to the species of Indian dill (A. sowa) and European dill (A. graveolens). Mediterranean countries in Eastern Europe, India and Russia are the main producers of dill essential oil (Henry et al., 2015).  The seeds of A. graveolens are used in folk medicine as an appetizer, carminative, diuretic, stomachic, digestive, sedative and in hemorrhoids (Jana and Shekhawat, 2010; Singh et al., 2005). Chewing of the seeds improves bad breath, e.g., halitosis. A. graveolens stimulates milk flow in lactating/nursing mothers and is often given to livestock for this reason. It also cures mental disorders, urinary infections and piles (Zheng et al., 1992). This plant is one of the additives used in gripe water usually given for relief of colic pain and hiccups in babies/infants and flatulence in young children (Nautiyal and Tiwari., 2011). Furthermore, it is used as a natural flavor enhancer in many food items, particularly in sauces, salads, soups, sea foods, fried meats and mainly in pickles. The essential oil is extracted from leaves, seeds and stems and is used as a flavoring agent in food and beverages due to its pleasant aroma. Additionally, the essential oil is used as perfume to aromatize soaps, detergents and cosmetics (Leopold et al., 2003).  Phytochemical screening of this plant showed that its flowers, seeds, leaves and stems were rich in polyphenols, tannins, terpenes, and cardiac and flavonoid glycosides (Singh et al., 2005; Nautiyal and Tiwari., 2011). Various pharmacological activities have been reported from A. graveolens plant parts, such as antihypercholesterolemic, chemopreventive effects, antimicrobial, antioxidant, antihyperlipidemic, antiulcer, mucosal protective, antisecretory, anticancer, antidiabetic, anti-inflammatory, insecticidal and analgesic activities (Zheng et al., 1992).  The A. graveolens volatile oil was reported to have numerous pharmacological activities, including antioxidant (El Mansouri et al., 2016), anticancer (Mohammed et al., 2018), antibacterial, antifungal and antimicrobial activities (Chahal et al., 2017), diuretic (Sahib et al., 2012), antidiabetic (Goodarzi et al., 2016), and anti-inflammatory & analgesic (Naseri et al., 2012) activities. The essential oil of A. graveolens seeds growing in Saudi Arabia were analyzed using HS-SPME and reported previously (Al-Massarani et al., 2018). To the best of our knowledge, no previous study has been conducted to compare the essential oil content of different parts of A. graveolens growing in Saudi Arabia using HS-SPME. The aim of our study was to evaluate and compare the volatile oil profiles of the flowers, seeds, leaves and stems of A. graveolens growing in Saudi Arabia and to determine the antimicrobial activities of each of these parts.  The headspace solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME) technique is a relatively new method for the extraction of volatiles, was developed in 1993 and has attracted growing attention over the past decade. It utilizes a fine quartz fiber with a polymeric coating to extract organic compounds from its matrix and directly transfer them into the injector of a gas chromatograph for thermal desorption and analysis. HS-SPME is designed to extract volatile compounds with a wide range of boiling points without forming artifacts. In the current work, the essential oils of the seeds, flowers, leaves and stems of Saudi A. graveolens plants were separately extracted using HS-SPME and analyzed using GC/MS. Subsequently, the antimicrobial capacity of each essential oil sample was evaluated against various bacterial and fungal strains.  ",FALSE,TRUE,

In March 2019, the seeds, flowers, stems, and leaves were carefully separated and then dried in the shade. It was identified by plant taxonomist Dr. Rajakrishnan Rajagopal, a botanist of the Science College Herbarium, King Saud University. A voucher specimen (#24547) was deposited in the herbarium of the College of Science, KSU. All protocols involving plants adhered to relevant ethical guidelines/regulations of King Saud University (Article #14).  2.2  Headspace solid-phase microextraction  Plant materials were placed in a 5 ml headspace vial and enriched for 1 h on a SPME fiber (PDMS/DVB/Carboxen, SUPELCO part no. 57298-U) at a temperature of 80 °C in a metal block in such a way that the plant material was subjected to the elevated temperature while the SPME fiber was kept cold (room temperature). The enriched fiber was placed in the GC injector, and the fiber desorbed for 1 min at 250 °C.  2.3  GC–FID and GC–MS analysis  Gas chromatography–flame ionization detector (GC–FID) and GC–MS analyses were performed in one run using an MS-FID-splitter consisting of a quartz Y-splitter, a short (ca. 20 cm) 0.1 mm id fused silica restrictor column as an inlet to the GC–MS interface, and a ca. A 1 m × 0.25 mm deactivated fused silica column served as a transfer line to the FID detector. The restrictor column was used to limit the MS vacuum flow and prevent the insertion of combustion gases from the FID, which operated at atmospheric pressure. Moreover, the analytical column flow had to be greater than the inflow to the MS detector, which was limited to approximately 1 mL/min by the restriction line. The GC column flow should also be constant; otherwise, the FID/MS split ratio would change with temperature. This configuration yielded an FID and MS chromatogram with almost identical retention times (RTs), thus facilitating the assignment of FID peaks to each substance. The Thermo Fisher Scientific Trace GC Ultra used a split/split less injector heated at 250 °C and connected to a 50 m × 0.25 mm × 1.0 μm SE-52 (95% polydimethylsiloxane, 5% polydiphenylsiloxane) capillary column (prepared and tested for deactivation and separation efficiency in our lab, Kurt, 1986), an FID detector operating at 250 °C, and a TriPlus RSH Autosampler.  For essential oil component identification, a Thermo Fisher Scientific ISQ mass spectrometer connected with a GC/MS interface heated at 250 °C was used in electron ionization mode at 70 eV and a filament at 50 μA. Furthermore, an ion source operating at 230 °C and a scan range of 40–500 amu. The oven temperature use gradient program involved heating for 1 min at 60 °C, then heating increased to 230 °C at a rate of 3 °C/min, and a 230 °C isotherm for 12.3 min. The carrier gas was helium and flowed at a constant rate of 1.5 mL/min.  2.4  Identification of the essential oil components  Thermo Xcalibur 2.2 software was used to identify the EO compounds by correlating the obtained mass spectra with the databases of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (The NIST 08), Wiley 8th ed (Wiley Registry™), Adams library (Robert, 2007), Mass Finder terpenoids library, and our own library. However, the mass spectra's simple comparison is not sufficient for a clear identification, especially for sesquiterpenes. Thus, the chromatogram position was also considered a second criterion determined by comparing the calculated retention indices (RIs) of the peaks with the corresponding literature data (Wiley Registry™ & The NIST 08) or reference compounds. The RI values were determined by measuring the RTs of a series of n-alkanes that were eluted across the entire chromatogram and were calculated according to the method of Van den Dool and Kratz (Van and Kratz 1963). Moreover, the EO components were quantified using normalized peak area calculations of the FID chromatogram without (by first approximation) relative FID-response factors.  2.5  Antibacterial assay  Agar diffusion methods were used in this study to assay the antibacterial activity of the essential oils against 9 different microbial strains, including Gram-positive; Staphylococcus aureus (CP011526.1), Bacillus licheniformis (KX785171.1) and Listeria innocua (DSM, 20649) and the Gram-negative; Enterobacter xiangfangensis (CP017183.1), Escherichia fergusonii (CU928158.2) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (NR-117678.1) bacterial strains. TSB tryptone soya broth media were used previously to grow the microorganisms as mentioned above for 24 h. Nutrient agar plates were used to distribute 0.1 mL of the microbial suspensions. Ten and 20 μl of each essential oil were spotted on the inoculated plates. Under sterile conditions and after 15 min, plates were incubated under optimal growth conditions for each strain. The free area without microbial growth was measured three times to detect the diameter of the zone of inhibition, and the mean was calculated. Gentamycin (10 μg) and tetracycline (10 μg) were used as positive controls, while DMSO was used as a negative control.  2.6  Antifungal activity  All essential oils were tested for their antifungal activity using the broth microdilution method according to Gong and Guo (Gong and Guo, 2009). The activity was tested against three pathogenic fungi: Candida albicans (MF942350), Candida parapsilosis (MF942354) and Aspergillus parasiticus (CBS 100926). One hundred microliters of the sample solutions was smeared in an SDA plate with approximately 3 × 106 colony-forming units (CFU) mL−1, followed by incubation at 37 °C for 1 day. The zone of inhibition diameters (in mm) was measured, and the rates of growth inhibition were obtained according to the following formula taking into consideration ±SD as the means:%Growth inhibition rate = (dc − ds)/(dc − d0) × 100where dc is the diameter of the untreated control fungus, ds is the diameter of the sample-treated fungus and d0 is the diameter of the fungus cut.  The experiment was carried out in three independent replicates, and the result is the average with standard deviation. Itraconazole was used as the positive control, and DMSO was used as the negative control.  2.7  Statistical analysis  Data analysis was expressed as the mean ± standard deviation (SD) of three replicates. The data were subjected to one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Based on Microsoft Excel 2010 statistical package analyses, the significant differences were considered statistically significant values p < 0.05.  ",TRUE,TRUE,

HS-SPME was applied as an extraction method for volatiles. Dill ether is the most abundant constituent of A. graveolens essential oils, and it was found in sufficient quantities in all studied parts of the plant. A comparison of different parts revealed that A. graveolens seed oils exhibited the most potent antimicrobial activity when compared to the other parts of the plant. This could be attributed to the presence of the highest content of carvone and its precursor limonene in seed essential oil. To our knowledge, this study is the first to evaluate and compare different parts of A. graveolens plants growing in Saudi Arabia in terms of their chemical composition and antimicrobial activities.

Myrcene, α-phellandrene, p-cymene, limonene, dill ether, carvone and dill apiole were found to be common components of A. graveolens plant seeds, flowers, leaves and stems essential oils. Dill ether is the most abundant constituent of A. graveolens essential oils, and it is found in sufficient quantities in all parts; 46.9, 33.3, 16.0, and 31.9% in flowers, seeds, leaves, and stems, respectively. The second main volatile component of A. graveolens essential oils were α-phellandrene, which was found in adequate quantities in flowers (2.9%), seeds (traces), leaves (6.1%) and stems (1.1%).  It is well established that essential oils are generally effective against many microorganisms, including bacteria and fungi. As typical lipophiles, they disrupt the structure of the cytoplasmic membrane and permeabilize it. In bacteria, membrane permeabilization is associated with the loss of ions and reduction of membrane potential (Bakkali et al., 2008; Sikkema et al., 1994). In this context, the present work was carried out to compare and investigate the activity of A. graveolens essential oils isolated from different parts against various strains of bacteria and fungi, the positive results will confirm the folkloric use of A. graveolens for curing many infectious diseases.  Our results show that A. graveolens oil samples (seeds, flowers, leaves and stems) exhibited good antimicrobial activities against the tested microorganisms (Table 2). Data analysis showed that the essential oil isolated from A. graveolens seeds exhibited the highest antimicrobial activity compared to other essential oils isolated from other parts of the same plant, followed by flowers, leaves and stems. Previous findings showed that essential oils rich with carvone and limonene usually exhibit strong antimicrobial activity (Delaquis et al., 2002; Singh et al., 2002). Taking this into account, one can expect good antimicrobial potential of A. graveolens essential oil in which carvone and its precursor limonene are the major constituents. This was proven by the antimicrobial assay of these samples, in which they showed superior activities when compared to control antimicrobials. The highest activity was observed against the S. aureus strain, with a diameter of inhibition equal to 25.0 ± 0.00 mm, followed by B. licheniformis, with a diameter of inhibition of 22.0 ± 1.60 mm, compared to gentamicin and tetracycline. Interestingly, all tested A. graveolens essential oil samples showed stronger antifungal activity against A. parasiticus than the control antifungal itraconazole (Table 2). These results are consistent with data previously reported that essential oils extracted from dill plants exhibit antifungal activity (Kaivan et al., 2016; Yuxin et al., 2013; Jun et al., 2012). To our knowledge, this is the first report with comparable testing of different parts of Saudi A. graveolens essential oils (seeds, flowers, leaves and stems) against different pathogenic microorganisms.

PMC8920927,Introduction,Introduction,CU928158,0,0,0,,,"  1  Introduction  Anethum graveolens L. (AG) is an important aromatic annual herb that is widely used as a spice in addition to its well-known carminative, stomachic and diuretic applications. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which is distributed in Southwest Asia and the Mediterranean and is native to Southeast Europe. It is commonly known as dill in English and “Shabat شبت” in Arabic (Navneet et al., 2019). It has been cultivated since ancient times and found to be closely related to the species of Indian dill (A. sowa) and European dill (A. graveolens). Mediterranean countries in Eastern Europe, India and Russia are the main producers of dill essential oil (Henry et al., 2015).  The seeds of A. graveolens are used in folk medicine as an appetizer, carminative, diuretic, stomachic, digestive, sedative and in hemorrhoids (Jana and Shekhawat, 2010; Singh et al., 2005). Chewing of the seeds improves bad breath, e.g., halitosis. A. graveolens stimulates milk flow in lactating/nursing mothers and is often given to livestock for this reason. It also cures mental disorders, urinary infections and piles (Zheng et al., 1992). This plant is one of the additives used in gripe water usually given for relief of colic pain and hiccups in babies/infants and flatulence in young children (Nautiyal and Tiwari., 2011). Furthermore, it is used as a natural flavor enhancer in many food items, particularly in sauces, salads, soups, sea foods, fried meats and mainly in pickles. The essential oil is extracted from leaves, seeds and stems and is used as a flavoring agent in food and beverages due to its pleasant aroma. Additionally, the essential oil is used as perfume to aromatize soaps, detergents and cosmetics (Leopold et al., 2003).  Phytochemical screening of this plant showed that its flowers, seeds, leaves and stems were rich in polyphenols, tannins, terpenes, and cardiac and flavonoid glycosides (Singh et al., 2005; Nautiyal and Tiwari., 2011). Various pharmacological activities have been reported from A. graveolens plant parts, such as antihypercholesterolemic, chemopreventive effects, antimicrobial, antioxidant, antihyperlipidemic, antiulcer, mucosal protective, antisecretory, anticancer, antidiabetic, anti-inflammatory, insecticidal and analgesic activities (Zheng et al., 1992).  The A. graveolens volatile oil was reported to have numerous pharmacological activities, including antioxidant (El Mansouri et al., 2016), anticancer (Mohammed et al., 2018), antibacterial, antifungal and antimicrobial activities (Chahal et al., 2017), diuretic (Sahib et al., 2012), antidiabetic (Goodarzi et al., 2016), and anti-inflammatory & analgesic (Naseri et al., 2012) activities. The essential oil of A. graveolens seeds growing in Saudi Arabia were analyzed using HS-SPME and reported previously (Al-Massarani et al., 2018). To the best of our knowledge, no previous study has been conducted to compare the essential oil content of different parts of A. graveolens growing in Saudi Arabia using HS-SPME. The aim of our study was to evaluate and compare the volatile oil profiles of the flowers, seeds, leaves and stems of A. graveolens growing in Saudi Arabia and to determine the antimicrobial activities of each of these parts.  The headspace solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME) technique is a relatively new method for the extraction of volatiles, was developed in 1993 and has attracted growing attention over the past decade. It utilizes a fine quartz fiber with a polymeric coating to extract organic compounds from its matrix and directly transfer them into the injector of a gas chromatograph for thermal desorption and analysis. HS-SPME is designed to extract volatile compounds with a wide range of boiling points without forming artifacts. In the current work, the essential oils of the seeds, flowers, leaves and stems of Saudi A. graveolens plants were separately extracted using HS-SPME and analyzed using GC/MS. Subsequently, the antimicrobial capacity of each essential oil sample was evaluated against various bacterial and fungal strains.  ",FALSE,TRUE,

In March 2019, the seeds, flowers, stems, and leaves were carefully separated and then dried in the shade. It was identified by plant taxonomist Dr. Rajakrishnan Rajagopal, a botanist of the Science College Herbarium, King Saud University. A voucher specimen (#24547) was deposited in the herbarium of the College of Science, KSU. All protocols involving plants adhered to relevant ethical guidelines/regulations of King Saud University (Article #14).  2.2  Headspace solid-phase microextraction  Plant materials were placed in a 5 ml headspace vial and enriched for 1 h on a SPME fiber (PDMS/DVB/Carboxen, SUPELCO part no. 57298-U) at a temperature of 80 °C in a metal block in such a way that the plant material was subjected to the elevated temperature while the SPME fiber was kept cold (room temperature). The enriched fiber was placed in the GC injector, and the fiber desorbed for 1 min at 250 °C.  2.3  GC–FID and GC–MS analysis  Gas chromatography–flame ionization detector (GC–FID) and GC–MS analyses were performed in one run using an MS-FID-splitter consisting of a quartz Y-splitter, a short (ca. 20 cm) 0.1 mm id fused silica restrictor column as an inlet to the GC–MS interface, and a ca. A 1 m × 0.25 mm deactivated fused silica column served as a transfer line to the FID detector. The restrictor column was used to limit the MS vacuum flow and prevent the insertion of combustion gases from the FID, which operated at atmospheric pressure. Moreover, the analytical column flow had to be greater than the inflow to the MS detector, which was limited to approximately 1 mL/min by the restriction line. The GC column flow should also be constant; otherwise, the FID/MS split ratio would change with temperature. This configuration yielded an FID and MS chromatogram with almost identical retention times (RTs), thus facilitating the assignment of FID peaks to each substance. The Thermo Fisher Scientific Trace GC Ultra used a split/split less injector heated at 250 °C and connected to a 50 m × 0.25 mm × 1.0 μm SE-52 (95% polydimethylsiloxane, 5% polydiphenylsiloxane) capillary column (prepared and tested for deactivation and separation efficiency in our lab, Kurt, 1986), an FID detector operating at 250 °C, and a TriPlus RSH Autosampler.  For essential oil component identification, a Thermo Fisher Scientific ISQ mass spectrometer connected with a GC/MS interface heated at 250 °C was used in electron ionization mode at 70 eV and a filament at 50 μA. Furthermore, an ion source operating at 230 °C and a scan range of 40–500 amu. The oven temperature use gradient program involved heating for 1 min at 60 °C, then heating increased to 230 °C at a rate of 3 °C/min, and a 230 °C isotherm for 12.3 min. The carrier gas was helium and flowed at a constant rate of 1.5 mL/min.  2.4  Identification of the essential oil components  Thermo Xcalibur 2.2 software was used to identify the EO compounds by correlating the obtained mass spectra with the databases of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (The NIST 08), Wiley 8th ed (Wiley Registry™), Adams library (Robert, 2007), Mass Finder terpenoids library, and our own library. However, the mass spectra's simple comparison is not sufficient for a clear identification, especially for sesquiterpenes. Thus, the chromatogram position was also considered a second criterion determined by comparing the calculated retention indices (RIs) of the peaks with the corresponding literature data (Wiley Registry™ & The NIST 08) or reference compounds. The RI values were determined by measuring the RTs of a series of n-alkanes that were eluted across the entire chromatogram and were calculated according to the method of Van den Dool and Kratz (Van and Kratz 1963). Moreover, the EO components were quantified using normalized peak area calculations of the FID chromatogram without (by first approximation) relative FID-response factors.  2.5  Antibacterial assay  Agar diffusion methods were used in this study to assay the antibacterial activity of the essential oils against 9 different microbial strains, including Gram-positive; Staphylococcus aureus (CP011526.1), Bacillus licheniformis (KX785171.1) and Listeria innocua (DSM, 20649) and the Gram-negative; Enterobacter xiangfangensis (CP017183.1), Escherichia fergusonii (CU928158.2) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (NR-117678.1) bacterial strains. TSB tryptone soya broth media were used previously to grow the microorganisms as mentioned above for 24 h. Nutrient agar plates were used to distribute 0.1 mL of the microbial suspensions. Ten and 20 μl of each essential oil were spotted on the inoculated plates. Under sterile conditions and after 15 min, plates were incubated under optimal growth conditions for each strain. The free area without microbial growth was measured three times to detect the diameter of the zone of inhibition, and the mean was calculated. Gentamycin (10 μg) and tetracycline (10 μg) were used as positive controls, while DMSO was used as a negative control.  2.6  Antifungal activity  All essential oils were tested for their antifungal activity using the broth microdilution method according to Gong and Guo (Gong and Guo, 2009). The activity was tested against three pathogenic fungi: Candida albicans (MF942350), Candida parapsilosis (MF942354) and Aspergillus parasiticus (CBS 100926). One hundred microliters of the sample solutions was smeared in an SDA plate with approximately 3 × 106 colony-forming units (CFU) mL−1, followed by incubation at 37 °C for 1 day. The zone of inhibition diameters (in mm) was measured, and the rates of growth inhibition were obtained according to the following formula taking into consideration ±SD as the means:%Growth inhibition rate = (dc − ds)/(dc − d0) × 100where dc is the diameter of the untreated control fungus, ds is the diameter of the sample-treated fungus and d0 is the diameter of the fungus cut.  The experiment was carried out in three independent replicates, and the result is the average with standard deviation. Itraconazole was used as the positive control, and DMSO was used as the negative control.  2.7  Statistical analysis  Data analysis was expressed as the mean ± standard deviation (SD) of three replicates. The data were subjected to one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Based on Microsoft Excel 2010 statistical package analyses, the significant differences were considered statistically significant values p < 0.05.  ",TRUE,TRUE,

In addition to the three pathogenic fungi C. albicans (MF942350), C. parapsilosis (MF942354) and A. parasiticus (CBS 100926), as shown in Table 2. The oil from seeds at 20 μL exhibited the highest antimicrobial activity. The best activity was observed against the S. aureus strain, with a diameter of inhibition equal to 25.0 ± 0.00, 17.0 ± 0.10, and 15.0 ± 1.10 mm for the essential oil isolated from seeds, flowers and leaves, respectively.

PMC9064559,Abstract,Abstract,NC_002516,0,0,0,,,"  Industrialization and modernization have led to humans being more susceptible to diseases. Therapeutic enzymes from traditional earthbound bacterial origin result have less therapeutic value. Hence, the hunt for a novel source of enzymes is indispensable. Twenty different marine bacterial strains were isolated from mangrove soil around S. P. Pattinum, Tamilnadu, India. From repeated qualitative and quantitative experiments, the study results were that, out of twenty bacterial isolates, only one Gram-negative bacterium was positive for multiple therapeutic enzymes such as asparaginase, glutaminase, uricase and collagenase. Based on its 99% 16S rRNA sequence similarity with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the isolate was designated as Pseudomonas aeruginosa AR01. Modified minimal medium amended with asparagine results in a simple and cost-effective, one-pot production medium for enhanced production and easy purification of all therapeutic enzymes. The biochemical studies imply that the therapeutic enzymes from P. aeruginosa AR01 may find a significant role in medical applications. The in vitro cytotoxic study reveals that the anticancer enzyme from P. aeruginosa is considerably effective with an IC50 value of 12 μg mL−1 against K-562 cell line. Colony PCR was performed for the detection of specific therapeutic enzyme-coding genes in the genome of P. aeruginosa AR01. PCR results confirm that P. aeruginosa AR01 possesses nucleotide regions for corresponding therapeutic enzymes in its gene cluster. BLASTN and BLASTX analyses of the partial nucleotide sequences of therapeutic enzymes were deposited in GenBank. The results appear so promising that Pseudomonas aeruginosa AR01 may be a potent candidate for medical biotechnology.  A simple and rapid screening of therapeutic enzymes from bacteria was conducted using functional- and sequence-based approach.  ",FALSE,FALSE,

Conclusions  In summary, for the first time a novel marine bacterium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa AR01, has been claimed to produce multiple therapeutic enzymes such as asparaginase (125.04 IU per mL), glutaminase (112.80 IU per mL), uricase (12.53 IU per mL) and collagenase (59.49 IU per mL) at a significant level that simultaneously exhibited excellent therapeutic potential in its crude form. Although there are many scientific reports on the production of these therapeutic enzymes from Pseudomonas aeruginosa, they emerged as a result of either functional research or benchwork research (bioinformatics). This is the first study to report the one-pot production of multiple therapeutic enzymes from a single strain which is confirmed by both functional and sequence-based approaches. Biochemical study shows the therapeutic enzymes from P. aeruginosa have a great scope in medical applications as they exhibited unique enzyme activity over wide temperature and pH ranges. In conclusion, we have developed a simple and contemporary process to screen therapeutic enzymes from bacteria. This approach possesses unique economy features such as production of multiple enzymes in a low-cost, simple, downstream-friendly production medium at a significant level with high potential to change the aspect of Pseudomonas sp. from its neglect due to its mythical pathogenicity. This present work may render a new insight into the rational research of Pseudomonas aeruginosa for the exploration of therapeutic enzymes. Therefore, this method will attract much attention in academic and pharmaceutical research. Further details of the purification and amino acid sequence of these enzymes are being pursued in our laboratory. At this point, we believe that these results from the current study emphasize the therapeutic importance of Pseudomonas sp. as a lead organism for further extensive research. Hence, we conclude that Pseudomonas aeruginosa AR01 seems to have promising potential in red biotechnology.  ",FALSE,TRUE,

Discussion  In the present work, a multiple therapeutic enzyme-producing marine bacterium was isolated and identified as Pseudomonas aeruginosa AR01. Pseudomonas sp. is well known for its wide variety of enzyme production spectra. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is not a single report describing the screening and presence of multiple therapeutic enzymes by a functional and sequence-based approach from this species.  l-Asparaginase is one of a few microbial enzymes with high therapeutic importance in treating certain kinds of cancers, where it is used to starve cancer cells of l-asparagine. Cancer cells, mainly lymphatic cells, require a high amount of asparagine for fast and malignant growth, as they are always in migration. l-Asparaginase was reported in various microorganisms, and E. coli and Erwinia asparaginases were widely used as chemotherapy agents due to their high catalytic activity and specificity.40 Usage of recombinant l-asparaginase in combination with other agents causes hypersensitivity in long-term usage, leading to allergic reactions and anaphylaxis.41  In this investigation, qualitative screening of asparaginase and glutaminase using bromothymol blue as a pH indicator results in better sensitivity than phenol red. The control plates without l-asparagine also showed prominent colony formation but no change in colour. The bromothymol blue dye is yellow at acidic pH, green at neutral and turns deep blue at alkaline pH. Due to the liberation of ammonia, the pH around the colony becomes alkaline and the dye changes its colour to deep blue.26P. aeruginosa AR01 displayed maximum asparaginase and glutaminase activities of 125.04 and 112.80 IU per mL in the MM-ASP production medium respectively. This result was in accordance with those of El-Bessoumy et al.9 and Yasser and Zakia10 recorded for Pseudomonas aeruginosa 50071 when cultivated in a solid-state fermenter. A similar observation has been noted in a marine bacterium, P. aeruginosa PAO1,11 isolated from Andaman coastal region and P. aeruginosa SN004 (ref. 12) strains displayed a substantial asparaginase activity in modified M9 medium. Intracellular asparaginase was reported in P. aeruginosa PAO1 by Kuwabara et al.13 These findings disclose the therapeutic importance of the asparaginase from P. aeruginosa AR01. In the case of glutaminase, marine isolates such as Pseudomonas sp. SFL-3 and Pseudomonas sp. BTMS-51 showed 32.7 IU and 21.07 U per mL activities respectively.14,15 Many attempts have been made for exploring new bacterial sources with different physiological properties to address certain problems. Undoubtedly, asparaginase from P. aeruginosa AR01 will meet these needs.  Evolutionary changes caused mutation in the gene cluster of humans and higher primates by introducing nonsense and missense mutation that leads to the annihilation of the uricase-encoding gene.42 Hence, we humans are lacking a self-producing uricase enzyme and are highly dependent on external sources. As a result, uric acid, the end product of purine metabolism, which is largely present as an insoluble monosodium salt, when elevated in human blood serum can cause gout.43 Thus, microbial uricase plays a vital role in degrading the accumulated uric acid. Various members of the genus Pseudomonas are able to grow using purines either as nitrogen source or as both nitrogen and carbon sources, where adenine, guanine, hypoxanthine, and xanthine served as a nitrogen source for P. aeruginosa.16 Several microorganisms can utilize uric acid as their sole source of nitrogen, this activity being detected as clear zones accompanying the growth of microorganisms in solid agar.44  The findings of the present study indicate P. aeruginosa AR01 as a potent producer of uricase as an extracellular enzyme which was confirmed by qualitative plate assay. From the uricase plate assay, the strain AR01 showed a significantly bigger zone of clearance by degrading the substrate uric acid within 24 h of incubation. In order to examine the nature of uricase synthesized by P. aeruginosa AR01, the CFCS was examined on the uric acid-agar plate. The well loaded with CFCS of P. aeruginosa AR01 showed a significantly large zone of clearance within 48 h of incubation, indicating the uricase produced by P. aeruginosa AR01 is extracellular in nature. Generally, the incubation period for uricase screening was up to 5–7 days, as the rate of uric acid utilization by bacteria is relatively slow.45 The above findings indicate P. aeruginosa AR01 as a potent producer of uricase as an extracellular enzyme.  From the enzyme assay study, P. aeruginosa AR01 exhibits a maximum uricase activity of 12.53 IU per mL. Several reports are available on uricase from Pseudomonas aeruginosa with an enzyme activity of 17.77 U per mL and 13.42 U per mL for P. aeruginosa 5Y2 and P. aeruginosa Ph3 respectively.17,18 Successful cloning and high-level expression of native uricase gene from P. aeruginosa Ps43 were reported by Shaaban et al.22 Some strains exhibit significantly higher enzyme activity of 25.88 U per mL at 12 h of incubation at a uric acid concentration 0.3% (w/v).19 The enzyme activity declined when the incubation was further extended as well as an increase in the substrate concentration. A similar phenomenon was observed in P. aeruginosa AR01, as it displayed maximum uricase activity of 8.1 IU per mL in the CFCS collected at 26th hour from MM-UA. Further increase in the concentration of uric acid in the production medium results in the hindrance in the growth of bacteria. This eventually results in a decline in uricase production. As mentioned earlier, even though the therapeutic enzymes produced by P. aeruginosa AR01 were in jeopardy because of the presence of the self-secreting extracellular protease, uricase was found to be highly stable, unlike other P. aeruginosa spp.  Also, the strain AR01 was screened for the presence of collagenase by using gelatin as a substrate. Gelatin is a class of protein fractions that have no existence in nature but are derived from the parent protein collagen by denaturation. Gelatin hydrolysis can confirm the qualitative determination of collagenase activity.46 The strain exhibits significant collagenase activity by degrading the precursor gelatin by forming a transparent zone. Collagenase production was evident as a clear or clear halo zone around the colonies.29,47 However, the clarity of the hydrolyzed zone may not be very sharp on the media plate. Therefore, the clarity of the hydrolyzed zone around the microbial colony can be improved by precipitating the proteins with trichloroacetic acid. The collagenase assay discloses P. aeruginosa AR01 to possess maximum collagenase activity of 59.49 IU per mL from the CFCS collected from MM-ASP. Even though the strain utilizes gelatin as its nitrogen source, MM-GEL displayed maximum collagenase activity of 35.03 IU per mL. Many P. aeruginosa species have been reported for collagenase production.24,26  Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the microbial hyena, can adapt to all environments; thus, it has become the most nutritionally versatile and ubiquitous in nature.48 The occurrence of P. aeruginosa in the water system of the Apollo space shuttle showed enhanced growth compared to normal gravity condition and strong biofilm production in space.49–51 These characters allowed us to optimize the culturing conditions and growth medium to a greater extent. Brewing astringent and strict growth medium by using simple ingredients result in an enhanced and unique behaviour of Pseudomonas. The ingredients are limited in a way to ensure simplicity, cost-effectiveness and compatibility for easy downstream processing. To accomplish the above standards, yeast extract is completely ignored as it may interfere with the purification process. The production medium was fortified with a specific substrate in order to enhance the production of a specific enzyme. In this current study, MM supplemented with specific substrates like asparagine, glutamine, uric acid and gelatin at different concentrations was extensively examined. The production of l-asparaginase was enhanced in the presence of l-asparagine.52 Gelatin was supplemented at various concentrations of 0.5–2.0% (w/v) in the production medium as a nitrogen source. The production of collagenase was decreased when the concentration of gelatin was increased beyond 1% (w/v).29 In contrast to these results, P. aeruginosa AR01 was able to produce more collagenase at 2.5% (w/v). A similar result was also found for protease production by Salinivibrio genus, where enzyme production gradually increased with increasing gelatin concentration from 1.0 to 2.0% (w/v).53 This could be because gelatin is an organic nitrogen source which acted as an inducer for enzyme production. Being an enzyme factory, Pseudomonas sp. is well known for its extracellular proteases.25 Also, P. aeruginosa AR01 was found to secrete an extracellular metalloprotease enzyme, collagenase. This scenario represents a great threat to the stability of other therapeutic enzymes in the production media. From the enzyme assay, it was found that, even though protease was present, the remaining therapeutic enzymes were highly stable and the enzyme activity does not undergo any change (data not shown). Increasing the concentration of asparagine, glutamine and gelatin (2.75% to 3%, w/v) and uric acid (0.5%, w/v) results in a decline of growth and enzyme production of bacteria (data not shown). This was due to high substrate concentration inhibition.  Utmost importance was given to designing the production medium for the enhanced production of these multiple therapeutic enzymes. As a result, MM was formulated by selecting the ingredients carefully. The ingredients must provide all the vital sources for the growth of bacteria and, at the same time, they should not possess any inhibitory effect. The result emphasizes that MM fortified with 2.5% (w/v) asparagine is the best production medium for all therapeutic enzymes. The advantages of MM-ASP as production medium were the low cost of the formulation as it is constituted of simple ingredients, allowing easy and simple downstream processing steps during the purification of therapeutic enzymes and one-pot production of all four therapeutic enzymes in a single production medium.  For medical applications, therapeutic enzymes should be thermally stable. This is considered as an important trait, for an enzyme with high thermal stability will have advantages in transportation, storage and clinical application.54 Most of the asparaginases act optimally at pH range 7–9 (ref. 55) and temperature range of 30–40 °C.52,56,57 The crude asparaginase and glutaminase from P. aeruginosa AR01 showed maximum activity at pH 9 and at 45 °C. Many reports are in agreement with a similar finding of our work.9,11–13 This result indicates the anticancer enzymes were highly stable and can encounter adverse physiochemical conditions when used as a drug. Sometimes, metal ions are important for enzyme actions and their structural modifications. Among the various metal ions tested, K+ and Mg2+ were found to enhance asparaginase and glutaminase activity. Mohamed et al.58 and Kumar et al.59 reported similar enhancement and inhibition results in asparaginase when treated with metal ions. Uricase from P. aeruginosa AR01 showed optimally higher activity at pH 9 and 40 °C under the influence of Ca2+ metal ion. This result was in agreement with Saeed et al.38 and Anderson and Vijayakumar.21 A few reports are available on the uricase from Pseudomonas aeruginosa where the enzyme activity was found to be highly stable at pH 8.5 (ref. 17, 18 and 60) and 9.20  The Pseudomonas genus is well known for its extracellular proteases and biofilm formation. Hence, the isolate AR01 was screened for collagenase enzyme. Most of the collagenolytic proteases come under two major groups, either metallo or serine collagenases. Among bacterial collagenolytic proteases, metallo collagenases are the most frequent, while serine classes are very rarely seen.61 Predominantly, microbial collagenases are found to be optimum at pH 5 to 9.5.46 Protease from P. aeruginosa has characteristic features of optimal activity at pH 7 and optimal temperature of 30 °C.62 In the current study, P. aeruginosa AR01 showed maximum collagenase activity at pH 7.5 and 37 °C. In the case of metal ion treatment, Ca2+ exhibits enhanced collagenase activity. Metal ions play a major role in improving the activity of microbial collagenase. Structural stability and activity of Clostridium collagenase were enhanced in the presence of calcium ions.63–65 However, collagenase activity was significantly inhibited by Fe2+.  From the zymogram analysis, a faint zone of clearance was observed in the lane loaded with CFCS treated with metalloprotease inhibitors. This indicates P. aeruginosa AR01 is capable of producing multiple types of proteases (serine and metalloproteases). Even though two classes of proteases are present, the metalloproteases constitute a greater extent, as there was a maximum inhibition found in the sample treated with metalloprotease inhibitor PHNT (88.90%) when compared to serine protease inhibitor PMSF (20.67%). The CFCS treated with PMSF showed 46.92 IU per mL collagenase activity, whereas the PHNT-treated CFCS exhibited 6.57 IU per mL of enzyme activity. This finding reveals P. aeruginosa AR01 produces metalloproteases at a dominant level when compared to serine protease. The residual collagenase activity result was in accordance with the zymogram result.  To explore the cytotoxic activity, we performed MTT assay with the human cancer cell line K-562 by measuring the cellular reduction of the tetrazolium dye MTT to its insoluble formazan crystals and observed that crude enzyme potently and significantly inhibited the proliferation of the tested cancer cell line. The cytotoxic efficacy of CFCS against the cell line is comparable to that of a commercial drug, which suggests that asparaginase or glutaminase purified from P. aeruginosa could be considered as an effective alternative chemotherapeutic agent. Similar cytotoxicity effect was observed in P. otitidis.66  The translated protein sequences for the corresponding therapeutic enzyme nucleotide sequences from P. aeruginosa AR01 were designated as asparaginase (ALB57098), glutaminase (ALP46107), uricase (ALP46108), elastase (ALI57161) and rhodanese (ALI57162). The phylogenetic tree shows the amino acid sequence of the therapeutic enzymes of P. aeruginosa AR01 was closely related (99–100% similarity) to that of the already reported therapeutic enzymes from Pseudomonas aeruginosa sp. Although there are plenty of reports stating the presence of these therapeutic enzymes in many strains of P. aeruginosa, there are no such wet lab reports confirming the enzyme activity in terms of both functional- and sequence-based approach in any P. aeruginosa sp.  Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a ubiquitous yet unique bacterium with an exceptional social IQ, is renowned for its wide range of enzyme profiles, making it an important candidate in modern biotechnology. A familiar anecdote concerning Pseudomonas spp. is that, for any real or imagined hydrocarbon, there is a species of Pseudomonas that can catabolize it given oxygen or nitrite and sufficient time.67 This wondrous species that can breed even in mundane distilled water can do miracles when it was cultured with a nourishing MM supplemented with asparagine. Recent exploration of P. aeruginosa for antibiotics against tuberculosis68 and anticancer compounds69,70 has been initiated. Many new antibiotics and anticancer drugs have been identified from marine bacteria. Recently, it was estimated that the culturability of microorganisms from marine sediments (0.25%) and especially seawater (0.001–0.10%) is considerably lower compared to those of soil (0.30%).71 Of the total sea surface, only 7–8% is a coastal and shallow area, the rest is an abyssal zone.72 So far, only the surface has been scratched. Modern technology enables us to go much deeper into the ocean facilitating the exploration of untouched environments.  ",FALSE,TRUE,

PMC9064559,Introduction,Introduction,NC_002516,0,0,0,,,"  1.  Introduction  The world, with a population of 7.63 billion people, is highly susceptible to more than 30 000 diseases, which have been clinically characterized. Of these, less than one-third can be treated and only a few can be cured.1 Emptiness and ineffectiveness in the arsenal of therapeutic agents led to a medical massacre with a huge death toll. The concept of the therapeutic enzyme has been around for at least 40 years.2 Screening of therapeutic enzymes is principally preferred from microbes, as they are cheaper, easy to cultivate and their enzymes are more predictable and controllable, unlike plant and animal enzymes. Therapeutic enzymes derived from existing native and engineered bacterial origins have become less effective. Hence, there is an urgent need for new effective therapeutic compounds that are potent, safe and cheaper for curing threatening diseases. Nature has been a provider of therapeutic compounds for millennia with many novel drugs isolated from microorganisms.3 Sometimes terrestrial microbes are considered when there is a need for novel therapeutics.2  Owing to the alarming emergence of dreadful diseases, there has been a great and growing market for therapeutic enzymes in the past decade. As a result, more biopharmaceuticals have been entering drug discovery and development pipelines in recent times. However, due to extensive research, exploration of ground-based natural bioactive compounds has become increasingly challenging. Instead, water-based natural compounds have become more promising alternatives, not only as pharmacological leads but also in industrial and commercial applications.4 It is believed that life on Earth began from the great ocean – the origin of life. The ocean covers 71% of the Earth's surface and contains 1.4 × 1021 litres of water. In the oceans, the vast majority of biodiversity is confined to the microbial fraction containing prokaryotes and eukaryotic microbes, which represents ∼60% of the biomass.5 The Indian mangrove forests comprise about 3.3% of the world's mangroves. It has been predicted that pelagic bacteria are exceptionally abundant, achieving densities of up to 106 to 109 per mL of seawater.6 Since primitive life most likely began in the oceans; marine microorganisms are considered as the closest living descendants of the original life form.7 Marine microbes are more cosmopolitan than terrestrial ones, as they must adapt to extreme marine environment conditions making them more diversified among their communities and in their biochemistry.1,7 Bioactive compounds isolated from these thriving microbial communities are likely to have a range of unique biochemical and physiological characteristics. Screening of a new source of therapeutic enzymes is a key research pursuit in red biotechnology. Marine bacteria have emerged as a vast repository of novel therapeutic enzymes in recent years. Despite the difficulty faced in isolation of marine bacteria, they are preferred over eukaryotes because of their higher productivity and ease of optimization of their culturing conditions.6 This present scenario advocates an alternative source of these medically important enzymes. The novel source must be a higher producer with fewer or no side effects. Considering the current scenario, the present study is an attempt to explore marine bacteria capable of producing therapeutic enzymes such as asparaginase, glutaminase, uricase and collagenase.  Pseudomonas, ubiquitous and remarkably nutritionally versatile organisms, can acclimate to almost any kind of environment making them successful colonizers among the bacterial community. Given these distinct characters, the members of the Pseudomonas genus can secrete a variety of unique extracellular enzymes. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is the customary candidate for bioremediation that has the potential to mineralize a wide range of natural organic compounds. This versatility allows for the rapid evolution of new metabolic pathways in order to degrade a given substrate. For example, a Pseudomonas strain was recently isolated that can utilize TNT (2,4,6-trinitrotoluene) as a sole nitrogen source, producing toluene, aminotoluene and nitrotoluenes as end products.8 A wide variety of extracellular enzymes such as asparaginase,9–14 glutaminase,11,15 uricase16–22 and collagenase23–26 were reported in Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

Materials and methods  2.1.  Isolation of bacteria  A soil sample was collected at a depth of 10 cm from the mangrove forest area around S. P. Pattinam (lat. 09°51′N, long. 79°05′E), Tamilnadu, India. The soil sample (approximately 10 g) was collected by using a sterile sample collection tube (Tarsons #510030) with a sterile spatula. The sample was then aseptically transported at 4 °C to the laboratory, where the sample was serially diluted up to 10−9 in sterile water and 100 μL from each dilution was plated onto sterile Zobell Marine Agar plates and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h.  2.2.  In situ screening of therapeutic enzymes  2.2.1.  Asparaginase and glutaminase  The isolates were screened for anticancer enzymes such as asparaginase and glutaminase by the qualitative plate assay method proposed by Mahajan et al.27 Modified M-9 medium (pH 7.0) was used containing (per 1000 mL): Na2HPO4·2H2O, 6 g; KH2PO4, 3 g; NaCl, 0.5 g; 1 mM MgSO4·7H2O, 2 mL; 20% glucose stock, 10 mL; agar, 20 g; and substrates l-asparagine and l-glutamine, 5 g each. The media were supplemented with 0.02% (w/v) bromothymol blue, a pH indicator. Control plates were prepared using a medium without substrates and NaNO3 was used as a nitrogen source instead of the substrate. The plates were inoculated and incubated overnight at 37 °C.  2.2.2.  Uricase  Primary screening of uricase was conducted by inoculating the isolates onto modified minimal medium (MM) plates (pH 7.5) containing (w/v) tryptone, 0.15%; K2HPO4, 0.015%; MgCl2, 0.05%; NaCl, 0.5%; and agar, 1.5%, which was adjusted with 0.5% uric acid. The plates were incubated at 37 °C overnight.28  2.2.3.  Collagenase  Qualitative screening of collagenase was conducted by a qualitative plate method.29 The isolates were inoculated on sterile MM agar plates containing 1% (w/v) gelatin. After incubation at 37 °C overnight, the plates were flooded with protein precipitating solution (30% w/v trichloroacetic acid).  2.3.  Growth condition of Pseudomonas aeruginosa AR01  An overnight-grown culture of AR01 strain (1% v/v, 1.092 OD600, 2.89 × 108 CFU mL−1) was inoculated into each individual flask containing 150 mL of MM fortified with substrates asparagine (MM-ASP), glutamine (MM-GLU), and gelatin (MM-GEL) each at 2.5% (w/v) and uric acid (MM-UA) at 0.3% (w/v) separately. Unfortified MM and Zobell marine broth served as controls. The flasks were incubated in a shaker at 120 rpm, 37 °C for 36 h. At every 2 h interval, 2 mL of culture from each flask was collected and the respective growth and enzyme activities were measured.  2.4.  Enzyme assays  For enzyme assay studies, cell-free culture supernatant (CFCS) of late-exponential phase (26 h) was collected from each production medium along with the controls. The absorbance for the enzymes assays was measured using an Agilent Cary 8454 UV-visible spectrophotometer (USA).  2.4.1.  l-Asparaginase and l-glutaminase  l-Asparaginase and l-glutaminase activity of the crude enzyme was measured by following the Nesslerization method.30 The reaction mixture contained 0.5 mL of the crude enzyme, CFCS and 0.5 mL of 0.04 M substrate solutions (asparagine and glutamine) taken in individual test tubes. To this, 0.5 mL of 0.05 M Tris–HCl buffer (pH 8.6) was added and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. After incubation, the reaction was terminated by adding 0.5 mL of 1.5 M trichloroacetic acid. The mixture was centrifuged at 10 000 rpm at 4 °C for 15 min. To 0.1 mL of clarified reaction mixture supernatant, 3.75 mL of distilled water was added to dilute, followed by the addition of 0.2 mL of Nessler's reagent. After 10 min of incubation at room temperature, the absorbance at 425 nm was measured with appropriate blanks. One unit (U) is defined as the amount of enzyme that liberates 1 μmol of ammonia per min at 37 °C.  2.4.2.  Uricase  The uricase activity was measured as described by Khade et al.31 To a test tube, 2.9 mL of 20 mM sodium borate (pH 8.5) containing 48 μM uric acid and 0.1 mL of the crude enzyme was mixed. The blank solution was taken by adding 0.1 mL of 20 mM sodium borate buffer instead of crude enzyme. The blank and test sample were incubated at 30 °C for 5 min under continuous mixing. The decrease in substrate concentration (uric acid) in the test samples was determined by measuring the absorbance at 293 nm. One unit (IU) of enzyme activity was defined as the amount of uricase needed to convert 1 μmol of uric acid into allantoin per minute under the standard assay conditions.  2.4.3.  Collagenase  This procedure was based on the methods proposed by Kim et al.,31 with slight modifications. A reaction mixture containing 10 mg of type I collagen was suspended in 2 mL of 50 mM TES (tris(hydroxymethyl)methyl-2-aminoethane sulfonate) buffer with 0.36 mM CaCl2 (pH 8.0) and 0.1 mL of the crude enzyme and was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. The reaction was stopped by centrifuging the reaction mixture at 5000 × g for 15 min at room temperature. For the blank, 0.1 mL of buffer was added in the place of crude enzyme. The supernatant (0.2 mL) was mixed with 1 mL of 4% ninhydrin solution and incubated in a boiling water bath (100 °C) for 20 min. The mixture was cooled to room temperature, and the solution was diluted with 2.5 mL of 50% 1-propanol for measurement of absorbance at 600 nm. The concentration of hydrolyzed amino acids was determined from a standard curve of l-leucine. One unit of enzyme activity was defined as the amount of enzyme that released 1 μmol of leucine per hour under the above conditions.  2.5.  Collagenase inhibition study  In order to rule out the type of collagenase, an inhibition study was performed.32 To do so, 2 mL of CFCS of MM amended with 2.5% (w/v) asparagine was separately treated with 10 mM of inhibitors like PMSF (phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, a serine protease inhibitor) and PHNT (1,10-phenanthroline, a metalloprotease inhibitor). After incubation at 37 °C for 5 h, the inhibited collagenolytic activity was measured. The untreated CFCS was considered as 100% enzyme activity.  2.6.  Zymography  Zymography was carried out by supplementing 0.1% (w/v) gelatin to the regular ingredients of the separating gel (10%) before polymerization and electrophoresis of samples treated with protease inhibitors (40 μL) under non-reducing conditions at 4 °C. After electrophoresis, the gel was washed twice for 30 min in a solution of 2.5% (v/v) Triton X-100 and then followed by incubation in an activation buffer (100 mM Tris–HCl, pH 8.0; 10 mM CaCl2; 150 mM NaCl) overnight at 37 °C. Then, the gel was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250 and destained with distilled water. Proteolytic activity was observed as a clear zone against the blue background of the gels.33  2.7.  Effect of temperature, pH and metal ions  The effect of temperature on enzyme activity was investigated in their respective assay mixtures at different temperatures of 37, 40, 45, 50, 55 and 60 °C. The pH of the reaction was maintained as that of the original assay condition (pH 8.6 for anticancer enzymes, pH 8 for collagenase and pH 8.5 for uricase). Correspondingly, to determine the effect of pH on the enzyme activities, the crude enzyme was incubated at different pH values of 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11. Here, the temperature was maintained constant at 37 °C. The assay buffers used were 50 mM citrate–phosphate buffer (pH 4.0–6.0), Tris–HCl buffer (pH 7.0–9.0), and carbonate–bicarbonate buffer (pH 10.0 and 11.0).34 Similarly, the effect of metal ions on the enzyme activity was studied by using 2 mM chloride salts of K+, Hg2+, Ca2+, Fe2+, Mg2+ and sulfate salts of Mn2+, Cu2+, Zn2+, Pb2+.35 In all cases, the CFCS was pre-incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. After incubation, relative activity was measured.  2.8.  Antibiogram assay  Antibiogram assay was performed by modifying the agar disc diffusion assay described by Jagadeesan et al.36 The strain P. aeruginosa AR01 was swabbed on sterile Mueller–Hinton agar plates. Commercial antibiotic discs, each 30 μg (neomycin, erythromycin, colistin, chloramphenicol, ciprofloxacin, bacitracin, tetracycline, ampicillin, penicillin, streptomycin and vancomycin), were then placed on the agar surface. Petri dishes were incubated at 37 °C for 16 h. The diameters of the zone of clearance around each antibiotic disc were measured using a graduated scale.  2.9.  In vitro cytotoxicity assay  The cytotoxicity effects of anticancer enzymes from CFCS collected from MM-ASP were evaluated using the MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay protocol.37 Briefly, human leukemia cell line (K-562) was procured from National Centre for Cell Science, Pune, India. The cell line was cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% l-glutamine, 100 U per mL penicillin, and 100 μg mL−1 streptomycin. The suspension cells were allowed to grow in an incubator shaker maintained at 5% CO2 at 37 °C for 24 h prior to the experiment. The cancer cell line was seeded in 96-well plates in such a way that each well had 20 × 103 cells followed by incubation for 12 h. After incubation, K-562 cells were treated with various concentrations of CFCS (3, 6, 12, 24, 48 and 96 μg mL−1). After treatment, the 96-well plates were incubated for 24 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2. The treated cells were incubated with 10% MTT for 3 h. The culture medium was aspirated and the wells were washed thrice with PBS and then 100 μL dimethyl sulfoxide was added to each well. The untreated cells and camptothecin (25 μM) were used as controls. Cell viability was determined by measuring the absorbance at 570 nm with a microplate reader (ELX-800, Biotek, USA). All the experiments were carried out in triplicate and then the values were calculated with the respective percentage of viable cells at different test concentrations relative to the untreated cells. The cell viability was calculated as follows:Cell viability (%) = (OD570 test cells/OD570 control cells) × 100  The IC50 value is defined as the drug concentration required to inhibit growth by 50% compared to control untreated cells.  2.10.  In silico analysis  The nucleotide sequences encoding therapeutic enzymes in P. aeruginosa AR01 were identified using gene-specific primers retrieved from the gene cluster of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 from the NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information) database.38 Primers were synthesized and obtained from G-Biosciences, Delhi, India (Table 1). The presence of respective therapeutic genes in P. aeruginosa AR01 strain was detected by using these gene-specific primers by performing the colony PCR technique.

Colony PCR  A single colony of P. aeruginosa AR01 was scraped from a marine agar plate and washed once with 100 μL of 1 M NaCl and thrice with 100 μL of Tris–EDTA (TE) buffer. The cells were finally suspended in 200 μL of TE buffer, lysed by freeze-thawing thrice and followed by 10 min of boiling and then snap-chilling for 5 min. The lysate was centrifuged at 12 000 rpm for 15 min. The supernatant was separated and used as a template for colony PCR. Each 20 μL of the reaction mixture contained 1 μL (10 ng) of the template, 10 μL of 2× ExPrime Taq DNA Polymerase Master Mix (GentBio), 1 μL each (10 pmol) of forward and reverse primers and 7 μL of nuclease-free water. Colony PCR was carried out using a Thermal Cycler C1000 (Bio-Rad). The cycling protocol for amplification involved an initial denaturation for 10 min at 95 °C, followed by 30 cycles of denaturation of 1 min at 95 °C, 1 min at 70, 68, 65, 63 and 62 °C for uricase, rhodanese, asparaginase, elastase and glutaminase respectively, 1 min at 72 °C, and a final extension was at 72 °C for 10 min. The PCR products were electrophoresed on 0.8% agarose gel in 0.5× TAE buffer and stained with ethidium bromide. The visible band observed under a UV transilluminator was then documented.39 The respective PCR products were purified using a PCR clean-up kit (PureLink® PCR Purification Kit, Invitrogen, K3100-01 and K3100-02). The purified PCR product was then subjected to DNA sequencing using an Applied BioSystems BigDye Terminator on a 3730xl Genetic Analyzer. The consensus of the two sequencing runs was processed and the contigs were aligned by the program Cap3. The aligned contigs were then deposited into GenBank.  2.12.  Statistical analysis  Each set of experiments were carried out in triplicate. Experiments were repeated separately to ensure reproducibility. All the results are expressed by mean ± SD (standard deviation) values. All statistical analysis (one-way ANOVA) was performed by the software GraphPad Prism version 7.0. A value of *p < 0.05 was considered as statistically significant.  ",TRUE,TRUE,

In situ qualitative screening of therapeutic enzymes  Based on colony morphology and pigmentation, 20 different bacterial isolates were observed on Zobell Marine Agar plate at a dilution of 10−7. The isolates were designated as AR01–AR20 in order of their identification. These 20 isolates were screened for the therapeutic enzymes by qualitative and quantitative assays.  The qualitative screening of asparaginase and glutaminase reveals that the area on which the isolate AR01 was inoculated showed positive for the presence of both enzymes by the formation of a dark-blue-coloured zone around the patched area due to the release of ammonia. Subsequently, the 20 isolates were screened for uricase enzyme. The plate amended with uric acid showed a clear zone around the isolate AR01 indicating the presence of uricase; the remaining areas appear milky white in colour. Since gelatin is the precursor of collagen, it was used as a substrate for the collagenase activity. Among the 20 isolates, P. aeruginosa AR01 showed maximum gelatinolytic activity by forming a transparent zone around the patched area. Therefore, the isolate AR01 was considered for the further screening process.  3.2.  Strain identification  From the molecular characterization, the multiple therapeutic enzyme-producing isolate AR01 was found to be a Gram-negative, motile, rod-shaped bacterium. The colony morphology of the strain was roundish, orangey smooth, semi-transparent, pearl-like appearance on Zobell Marine Agar plate. The BLAST analysis of the 16S rRNA sequence (KF929428) showed a high degree of similarity with P. aeruginosa. Therefore, this strain was considered to be a sub-species and it was designated as Pseudomonas aeruginosa AR01. Since most of the Pseudomonas spp. were found to be multi-drug resistant in nature, antibiogram assay was conducted for P. aeruginosa AR01. From the antibiogram assay, P. aeruginosa AR01 was found to be susceptible to many commercial antibiotics and resistant to colistin, ampicillin and penicillin.  3.3.  Growth of P. aeruginosa AR01 and therapeutic enzyme production pattern  P. aeruginosa AR01 exhibits normal growth pattern in all media except unfortified MM. The lag phase of P. aeruginosa AR01 persists for 2nd to 5th hour. The log phase commenced at the 6th hour and it continued until the 26th hour. P. aeruginosa AR01 showed exponential growth throughout the phase. At the end of the log phase (26th hour), P. aeruginosa AR01 showed maximum growth in all growth media. P. aeruginosa AR01 enters into death phase at 28th hour where the OD600 tends to decline. In the case of MM, the growth of P. aeruginosa AR01 was highly retarded. The growth was restricted to a maximum OD600 of 1.102. P. aeruginosa AR01 showed uniform growth phase irrespective of media. The corresponding growth and enzyme activities of each growth medium were recorded and are depicted in Fig. 1. From the repeated growth experimental studies, it was found that MM-ASP was found to be the best production medium for the production of all four therapeutic enzymes. Henceforth, MM-ASP was used for routine cultivation of P. aeruginosa AR01 and production of therapeutic enzymes. CFCS collected at the end of the log phase (26th hour) of incubation was used for further enzyme assays.

MB, marine broth; MM, modified minimal medium; MM-ASP, modified minimal medium amended with 2.5% (w/v) asparagine; MM-GLU, modified minimal medium amended with 2.5% (w/v) glutamine; MM-GEL, modified minimal medium amended with 2.5% (w/v) gelatin; MM-UA, minimal medium amended with 0.3% (w/v) uric acid.  From the anticancer enzyme assays, P. aeruginosa AR01 showed maximum enzyme activity of 125.04 and 112.80 IU per mL for asparaginase and glutaminase respectively from the CFCS collected from MM-ASP (Fig. 1(b)). Also, P. aeruginosa AR01 displayed maximum activity of 12.53 IU per mL of uricase activity from the CFCS collected from MM-ASP (Fig. 1(c)) and 59.49 IU per mL of collagenase activity in the CFCS of MM-ASP (Fig. 1(d)). Significant enzyme activity was observed in other production media. Among the different production media, P. aeruginosa AR01 displayed maximum enzyme activity for all therapeutic enzymes in MM-ASP.  3.4.  Inhibition study  To investigate the type of collagenase, CFCS of P. aeruginosa AR01 was treated with metalloprotease and serine protease inhibitors. The collagenase assays revealed that metalloprotease inhibitor PHNT strongly inhibited the collagenase activity (88.90%). In contrast, the serine protease inhibitor PMSF showed limited inhibitory effect (20.67%). The residual activity of the treated samples is depicted in Fig. 2(a). Untreated CFCS was considered as 100% collagenase activity. Similarly, the zymogram depicts a distorted zone of clearance in wells loaded with CFCS treated with PHNT. Zone of clearance was observed in the wells loaded with untreated CFCS and PMSF-treated CFCS, indicating the presence of collagenase at a significant level (Fig. 2(b)).

(b) Zymography analysis of culture filtrate treated with different protease inhibitors: (1) control, untreated culture filtrate; (2) PMSF-treated culture filtrate; (3) PHNT-treated culture filtrate.  3.5.  Effect of temperature, pH and metal ions  The effects of temperature, pH and metal ions are summarized in Fig. 3. The anticancer enzymes displayed optimum activity at pH 9 (132.50 IU per mL for asparaginase and 120.32 IU per mL for glutaminase) and 45 °C (132.47 IU per mL for asparaginase and 120.92 IU per mL for glutaminase). Uricase demonstrated maximum activity at pH 9 (13.27 IU per mL) and 40 °C (15.11 IU per mL). Collagenase activity was found optimum at pH 7.5 (60.16 IU per mL) and 37 °C (59.49 IU per mL) (Fig. 3(a) and (b)). Among the metal ions tested, K+ and Mg2+ ions substantially enhanced the asparaginase (119% and 109%) and glutaminase activity (114% and 106%) and negligible inhibition was observed for Ca2+ (87%) and Mn2+ (97%). In contrast, the addition of metal ions Zn2+ and Hg2+ had a high degree of inhibitory effect. In the case of uricase, Ca2+ (121%) and Cu2+ (113%) showed a significant increase in the enzyme activity. Similarly, Ca2+ exhibited enhanced the collagenase activity to 112%. For all the enzymes, Hg2+ showed lower relative activity when compared to all metal ions (Fig. 3(c) and (d)).

(a) Effect of various temperatures, (b) effect of various pH and (c and d) effect of various monovalent and divalent metal ions on anticancer enzymes (asparaginase, glutaminase, uricase and collagenase).  3.6.  In vitro cytotoxicity  In vitro cytotoxicity effects of the crude anticancer enzymes were evaluated against K-562 cells at different concentrations. A dose-dependent effect of CFCS against K-562 cells was observed. The IC50 value of CFCS was found to be 12 μg mL−1 (Fig. 4). The cell viability was significantly decreased with respect to an increase in the CFCS concentration. The commercial drug camptothecin exhibits an IC50 value of 25 μM. These results suggest that crude enzyme induces cytotoxicity in human cancer cells and its cytotoxic potential is comparable to that of a commercial drug.

In silico analysis  The NCBI database search reveals the nucleotide sequences corresponding to therapeutic enzymes of our interest are found in many strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, thus confirming a wide distribution of all therapeutic genes in most of the Pseudomonas spp. These Pseudomonas spp. were found to be closely related to P. aeruginosa AR01 in terms of 16S rRNA sequence homology. From the database search, it was found that many therapeutic enzymes were reported in the 6.3 million base pair gene clusters of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1. The nucleotide sequence and the gene ID data are presented in Table 1.  3.8.  Therapeutic enzyme nucleotide sequences  The colony PCR products displayed positive amplification when they were electrophoresed along with 100 bp DNA ladder (GeneRuler 100 bp Plus DNA Ladder, Thermo Scientific SM0323). The results of the therapeutic enzyme amplicons obtained by colony PCR are illustrated in Fig. 5. The BLASTn analysis of the obtained sequences of all therapeutic genes showed 99% similarity with respective genes of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The partial nucleotide sequences of all five therapeutic genes detected from Pseudomonas aeruginosa AR01 were deposited in GenBank (asparaginase, KR349299; glutaminase, KT862887; uricase, KT229576; elastase, KR534608; and rhodanese, KR534609). Fig. 6(a)–(f) illustrates the phylogenetic relationship of 16S rRNA sequence and amino acid sequence of all therapeutic genes of P. aeruginosa AR01 with closely related P. aeruginosa spp. Asparaginase, glutaminase and uricase were evidently proved by both functional and sequence approaches. Whereas, elastase and rhodanese were detected by a sequence-based approach and collagenase was evaluated by a functional-based one.

In rabbits, the infection is generally associated with the P. multocida serogroups A and D, and the knowledge about the serogroup F is limited. In the present study, a P. multocida serogroup F isolate designated s4 was recovered from the lungs of rabbits died of respiratory disease in Fujian, in the southeast of China. The pathogenicity and genomic features of the s4 were then determined.  Results  The serotype and sequence type of s4 were F:L3 and ST12, respectively. The s4 was pathogenic for rabbits, but it was a low virulent strain comparing to the previously reported highly pathogenic P. multocida serogroup F strains J-4103, C21724H3km7, P-4218 and HN07. The whole genome of the s4 was then sequenced to understand the genomic basis for pathogenicity. Particularly, a large-sized fragment of approximate 275 kb in length was truncated from the chromosome to form a plasmid. Moreover, the in-frame deletion of natC and N-terminal redundance of gatF would resulted in the production of a mutant L3 outer core structure that was distinct from those of the other P. multocida strains belonging to the lipopolysaccharide genotype L3. We deduced that these features detected in the genome of s4 might impair the pathogenicity of the bacterium.  Conclusions  This study evaluated the pathogenicity and determined the genomic features of the rabbit sourced P. multocida serogroup F isolate s4, the observations and findings would helpful for the understanding of the pathogenicity variability and genetic diversity of P. multocida.

The infection of P. multocida is often associated with economically important diseases, such as fowl cholera in poultry, haemorrhagic septicaemia in bovine, progressive atrophic rhinitis in swine, and respiratory disease in rabbit [1, 2]. P. multocida strains can be classified into five capsular serogroups or capsular genotypes (A, B, D, E and F) and further classified into sixteen lipopolysaccharide (LPS) serotypes (1–16) or eight LPS genotypes (L1-L8) [3, 4]. P. multocida strains can also be typed by using the multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) scheme based on the seven housekeeping genes [5, 6]. Rabbit pasteurellosis is generally associated with the strains of capsular serogroups A and D, LPS genotypes L3 and L6, and MLST sequence types ST10, ST11 and ST12 [7, 8]. However, some reports showed that strain of serogroup F that predominately circulated in poultry had also been detected in rabbits, and the bacterium was highly pathogenic for rabbits [9–12].  Rabbit farming is popular in Fujian, in the southeast of China [8, 13]. The number of rabbits farmed and the amount of rabbit meat yielded in Fujian were about 10.67 million and 16.2 thousand tons by the end of 2019 (Fujian Statistical Yearbook, 2020), respectively. Our previous work showed that P. multocida was widespread in rabbits in Fujian, but only strains of serogroups A and D were detected [8]. In July 2020, a respiratory infectious disease broke out on a local rabbit farm in Fujian, and around 500 rabbits died of the disease during a 30-day period. Clinical signs of cough and nasal discharge were observed in the diseased rabbits. Gross pathological lesions including hemorrhagic pneumonia and pulmonary consolidation were showed in the dead rabbits. Four PCR assays were used to screen the potential causative agents including Rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV) [14], P. multocida [3], Bordetella bronchiseptica (B. bronchiseptica) [15] and Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) [16] in the 48 lung samples collected from the dead rabbits. The results showed that the RHDV, B. bronchiseptica and S. aureus were negative, but the P. multocida was positive for the all 48 lung samples and a P. multocida serogroup F isolate named s4 was recovered from the all samples. To our knowledge, the information on the isolation and/or identification of P. multocida serogroup F strain in the rabbits in Fujian is limited, and especially, there was no report concerning the pathogenicity of rabbit sourced P. multocida serogroup F strain isolated from Fujian.  In present study, the s4 was defined by capsular typing, LPS genotyping, MLST, screened virulence factors, and evaluated the pathogenicity in rabbits. Moreover, the whole genome sequence of s4 was determined, and the whole genome comparison between the s4 and the other P. multocida serogroup F strains was performed. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the pathogenicity and determine the genetic features of the rabbit sourced P. multocida serogroup F isolate s4.  ",FALSE,TRUE,

""The complete genome of s4 was sequenced and then the comparative genomic analyses were performed to better understand the genetic basis for the pathogenicity of s4""","  Discussion  P. multocida serogroup F was first isolated from turkeys in the USA in 1987 [19], and since then it has been mainly associated with the infections in avian hosts [20–22]. P. multocida is one of the important pathogens results in morbidity and mortality in rabbits, whereas only the serogroups A and D had been previously recognized as the causative agents of rabbit pasteurellosis [7, 12]. It was not until 2008 that the pathogenicity of P. multocida serogroup F for rabbit was documented [12]. Since then, the presence of P. multocida serogroup F has been identified in the important rabbit farming areas worldwide [9–11]. However, the knowledge about the pathogenicity and genetic characteristics of the rabbit sourced P. multocida serogroup F is still limited. In the present study, the pathogenicity of a rabbit sourced P. multocida serogroup F isolate s4 was evaluated and the whole genome of the isolate was sequenced, which would helpful for the understanding of the pathogenitity of rabbit sourced P. multocida serogroup F.  Unexpectedly, the inoculation of s4 did not cause death and result in severe gross lesions in most of the challenged rabbits. The results were in contradict with the previous study, in which the inoculation of rabbit sourced P. multocida serogroup F isolate J-4103 caused high mortality and resulted in severe pathological lesions in most of the challenged rabbits (acute septicemic syndrome and extensive hemorrhage in subcutis in subcutaneously challenged rabbits, and fibrinopurulent pleuropneumonia and extensive hemorrhagic pneumonia in intranasally challenged rabbits) [12]. Moreover, P. multocida serogroup F isolates from chicken (C21724H3km7), turkey (P-4218) and pig (HN07) were also highly virulent to rabbit without prior adaption [23, 24]. The results suggested that the variation in virulence among P. multocida serogroup F strains, and the s4 was a low virulent strain by comparison with the J-4103, C21724H3km7, P-4218 and HN07. Additionally, it should be alert to the potential transmission of P. multocida serogroup F from chicken, turkey and pig into rabbit, which might cause high mortality and subsequent huge economic loss to rabbit farming.  P. multocida possesses a number of virulence genes, which contributes to the fitness and pathogenicity of the pathogen [1]. The s4 carried a panel of virulence genes including ptfA, tadD, hgbB, ompA, omph and oma87. The ptfA, tadD, ompA, omph and oma87 encode the proteins that are associated with P. multocida virulence because of their roles in the attachment and colonization of host [25, 26]. The hgbB encodes an outer membrane protein, which is involved in iron acquisition [25]. Interestingly, the P. multocida serogroup D isolates carrying the hgbB were significantly associated with the clinical presentation of respiratory disease in rabbits [9]. Additionally, comparative genomic analyses between s4 and Pm70 identified a unique gene in s4 but absent in Pm70. The unique gene (LCY73_01710) encoded TonB-dependent receptor that is essential for transport of organic iron chelators (siderophores) into the periplasm to establish commensal and pathogenic relationships with the hosts [27]. In Pm70, more than 2.5% of the genome was devoted to genes encoding proteins involved in iron uptake and acquisition, suggesting that iron uptake and acquisition is important for P. multocida survival and pathogenesis [17]. Taken together, the presence of these genes might contribute to the pathogenicity of the s4.  The complete genome of s4 was sequenced and then the comparative genomic analyses were performed to better understand the genetic basis for the pathogenicity of s4. The genome of s4 shared a high level of DNA identity to that of Pm70. However, the genome of s4 was smaller (approximate 200 kb) than that of Pm70, which might result in the loss of a number of functional genes and subsequently impaired the pathogenicity of the s4. Interestingly, the s4 possessed a plasmid of approximate 275 kb in length, and the sequence of the plasmid shared a high level of DNA identity (up to 90% identity) to the plasmid (approximate 325 kb in length) of rabbit sourced P. multocida serogroup F strain CIRMBP-0884. Additionally, the plasmids of the rabbit sourced P. multocida serogroup F strains s4 and CIRMBP-0884 were highly identical (up to 85% indentity) to the other P. multocida genomes at nucleotide level. Therefore, it was deduced that the sequences of the plasmids of s4 and CIRMBP-0884 might derive from their own genomes. Interestingly, only a small number of P. multocida strains possess plasmids according to the P. multocida genomes deposited in the NCBI genome database. The plasmids of P. multocida strains often carry antibiotic resistance genes and mobilization genes [28], and plasmids of some P. multocida strains carry the toxA gene encoding the dermonecrotic toxin [28]. Unexpectedly, the antibiotic resistance genes, mobilization genes and toxin gene were not determined in the plasmid of s4.  LPS is an important virulence determinant of P. multocida [29]. The LPS of the s4 belongs to the genotype of L3. It was showed that P. multocida strains belonging to the LPS genotype L3 might be highly virulent because these strains were the most common causative agents of fowl cholera [4, 29]. The L3 outer core structure is similar to the self-antigen of host, which facilitates the bacteria evading the host innate immune system [29]. The in-frame deletion of natC and the N-terminal redundance of gatF would result in the production of a mutant L3 outer core structure, which might contribute to the low pathogenicity of s4. Interestingly, the genetic diversities of natC and gatF from P. multocida serogroup F:L3 strains of CIRMBP-0873, CIRMBP-0884 and HN07 were also detected (Fig. 8) [30]. Taken together, the effects of the polymorphism in the LPS outer core genes natC and gatF on the pathogenicity of P. multocida would be worth eliciting in the further work.  Fig. 8Comparative analyses of the LPS outer core locus of s4. The genes required for the assembly of the LPS outer core of s4 were compared with those of CIRMBP-0873 (LPS genotype L3), CIRMBP-0884 (LPS genotype L3) and Pm70 (LPS genotype L3).

""The expected PCR products were purified and sequenced, and the identities of these products were confirmed by comparing the sequences against the NCBI GenBank database.""","  Methods  Sample collection and detection of potential pathogen  A total of 48 lung samples were collected from the naturally infected dead rabbits. Each lung sample was placed in a sterile tube, kept on ice and delivered to our lab for examination within 24 h. Each lung sample was homogenized to make a 50% suspension in sterile normal saline. For the detection of RHDV, the suspension was centrifuged at 1500×g for 15 min at 4 °C, and two hundred microliter of the supernatant was collected and used for viral RNA extraction using the EasyPure Viral DNA/RNA kit (TransGen Biotech, Beijing, China). The extracted viral RNA was reverse-transcribed to complementary DNA (cDNA) using the EasyScript Reverse Transciptase (TransGen Biotech, Beijing, China) by using the Oligo-dT18 as the primer. The synthetic cDNA was used as the genomic template to screen the presence of the RHDV in the lung samples by using the PCR assay described by Schwensow et al. [14]. For the detection of P. multocida, B. bronchiseptica and S. aureus, one hundred microliter of lung suspension was centrifuged at 5000×g for 10 min at room temperature, and the pellet was used for bacterial DNA extraction using the EasyPure Bacteria Genomic DNA kit (TransGen Biotech, Beijing, China). The extracted DNA was used as the genomic template to screen the presence of the P. multocida, B. bronchiseptica and S. aureus in the lung samples by using the PCR assays described by Townsend et al. [3], Wang et al. [15] and Brakstad et al. [16], respectively.  P. multocida isolation and identification  One hundred microliter of the lung suspension was spread on the BHI agar plate containing 5% defibrinated sheep blood and incubated at 37 °C for 24 to 48 h. Three isolates from each plate were randomly picked up and each isolate was inoculated in 5 mL of BHI containing 2% bovine serum. Then, the isolates were shaken at the conditions of 180 rpm and 37 °C for 24 h. To confirm the identities of the isolates, the 16S rRNA genes of the isolates were amplified and sequenced [31], and the capsular types and LPS genotypes of the isolates were defined using the PCR assays described by Townsend et al. [3] and Harper et al. [4], respectively.  MLST  The MLST analyses of the isolates were conducted using the Multi-host MLST scheme described in the PubMLST (https://pubmlst.org/pmultocida/). The genomic DNA of the isolates were prepared using the EasyPure Bacteria Genomic DNA kit (TransGen Biotech, Beijing, China), and the seven housekeeping genes including adk, aroA, deoD, gdhA, g6pd, mdh and pgi of each isolate were amplified from the genomic DNA of the isolates. The expected PCR products were purified and subjected to sequence. The allelic profile of each isolate was defined by comparing the sequences of the 7 housekeeping genes of each isolate to the corresponding known sequences in the PubMLST database. The sequence type of each isolate was then defined by submitting the allelic profile to the PubMLST database.  Virulence genes detection  The genomic DNA of the isolates were prepared using the EasyPure Bacteria Genomic DNA kit (TransGen Biotech, Beijing, China) and were screened for the presence of twelve virulence genes including adhesion related proteins (ptfA, tadD and pfhA), dermonecrotoxin (toxA), iron binding proteins (fur, tbpA and hgbB), sialidases (nanB), hyaluronidase (pmHAS) and outer membrane proteins (ompA, ompH and oma87). Primers used for ptfA, tadD, pfhA, toxA, fur, nanB, pmHAS, ompA, ompH and oma87 were described by Tang et al. [26]. Primers used for tbpA and hgbB were described by Ewers et al. [25]. The expected PCR products were purified and sequenced, and the identities of these products were confirmed by comparing the sequences against the NCBI GenBank database.  Animal experiments  Twenty-four 30-day-old rabbits obtained from a local rabbit farm were randomly divided into three groups (subcutaneous inoculation group, intranasal inoculation group and negative control group) of eight rabbits each (four males and four females). Each group was placed in a separate room, and two rabbits (one male and one female) from the same group were kept in a cage. Before infection, nasal, conjunctival and rectal swabs as well as whole blood were collected for bacteriological detection to ensure P. multocida-free status of the rabbits [12]. The sera of the rabbits were also tested for the presence of P. multocida IgG as described by Jaglic et al. [12].  Rabbits in groups of subcutaneous inoculation group and intranasal inoculation group were subcutaneously and intranasally inoculated with 6.0 × 104 CFU of the isolate suspended in 100 μL of sterile normal saline, respectively. Rabbits in the negative control group were intranasally inoculated with 100 μL of sterile normal saline. The challenge does and routs were selected as described by Jaglic et al. [12, 23]. The clinical signs including cough, nasal discharge and dyspnea were monitored twice daily for 15 days for the all rabbits. At the end of the experiment, the gross lesions of the all rabbits were examined and tissue samples including tracheas, lungs, livers, hearts, spleens, kidneys and whole blood of all rabbits were collected for bacteriological examination, and the sera was used for serological examination as described by Jaglic et al. [12]. Lung samples from the rabbits of intranasal inoculation group were histologically examined using hematoxylin-eosin staining.  Prior to challenge, all the rabbits were anaesthetized with intravenous injection of ketamine (40 mg/kg). Rabbits that were caught up in the endpoint (dyspnoea, weight loss of 15% or inability to access feed or water), and rabbits that survived until the 15 days were also sacrificed under ketamine narcosis to minimize sufferings.  Genome sequencing and comparative analysis  The whole genome of the isolate was sequenced using PacBio system (Pacific Biosciences, USA) at Shanghai Majorbio Bio-Pharm Technology Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). The PacBio system generated 244,686 total reads and 1,833,208,095 total bases, with the average reads length of 7492.08 bases and the average genome coverage of 891-fold. The raw reads were analyzed on the Majorbio Cloud Platform (www.majorbio.com), and then the complete genome of the isolate was de novo assembled. The complete genome of the isolate was annotated using the NCBI Prokaryotic Genome Annotation Pipeline. Genomic island and prophage were determined using IslandViewer 4 [32] and PHAST [18], respectively. Drug resistance genes were determined by comparing the sequence of the isolate against the comprehensive antibiotic resistance database (CARD) (https://card.mcmaster.ca/). The circular genome map of the isolate was plotted using DNAPlotter (version 17.0.1) [33]. The complete genomes of the P. multocida strains CQ2 (capsular serogroup A), HN06 (capsular serogroup D), Pm70 (capsular serogroup F), HN07 (capsular serogroup F), CIRMBP-0873 (capsular serogroup F) and CIRMBP-0884 (capsular serogroup F) were freely obtained from NCBI database under the accession numbers of CP033599, CP003313, AE004439, CP007040, CP020347 and CP020345, respectively. The whole genome comparison between the isolate and these strains was performed by using progressiveMauve alignment procedure on Mauve (version 2.4.0) [34], BLAST (version 2.4.0) [35], BRIG (version 0.95-dist) [36] and Easyfig (version 2.2.5) [37].

The results showed that RHDV, B. bronchiseptica and S. aureus were negative for the all 48 lung samples, whereas P. multocida was positive for the all 48 lung samples. All the lung samples were then subjected to P. multocida isolation.  All the 48 lung samples produced identical bacterial colonies on brain heart infusion (BHI) blood agar plate. The colonies were grey, round, smooth and less than 1 mm in diameter. Three colonies from each lung sample were randomly picked up. The sequences of the 16S rRNA genes of the 144 isolates recovered from the 48 lung samples were identical and shared the highest identity (range from 99.90 to 100%) with that of P. multocida. The PCR assays for capsular and LPS typing of the isolates yielded segments of approximate 850 bp and 470 bp in length, and the sequences of the two segments were 100% identical with the fcbD and gatF of P. multocida, respectively. The results indicated that the 144 isolates were P. multocida serotype F:L3.  MLST  The allelic numbers of the 7 housekeeping genes (adk, aroA, deoD, gdhA, g6pd, mdh and pgi) of the 144 isolates were identical and assigned as 8–8–5-3-5-7-5, and the sequence types of the 144 isolates were then defined as ST12.  Virulence genes detection  The virulence genes ptfA, tadD, hgbB, ompA, omph and oma87 were positive for the 144 isolates, whereas the virulence genes pfhA, toxA, fur, tbpA, nanB and pmHAS were negative for the all isolates. The sequence of each of the virulence genes (ptfA, tadD, hgbB, ompA, omph and oma87) of the 144 isolates were identical, and the sequences of these six virulence genes shared highest identity (ranged from 99.90 to 100%) with the corresponding virulence genes of P. multocida.  Taken together, the serotypes, sequence types and the virulence gene profiles of the 144 isolates were identical, suggesting that all the isolates were derived from the same progenitor (Fig. 1). In this study, one of the isolates named s4 was selected as the representative for the following animal experiments and whole genome sequencing.Fig. 1Neighbour-joining tree indicating the position of P. multocida isolate s4 based on the seven MLST genes. The seven MLST genes of P. multocida (adk, aroA, deoD, gdhA, g6pd, mdh and pgi), B. bronchiseptica (adk, fumC, glyA, tyrB, icd, pepA and pgm) and S. aureus (arcC, aroE, glpF, gmk, pta, tpi and yqiL) were concatenated, and then the neighbour-joining tree was constructed using MEGA 5.0 (1000 of bootstrap replications). The senve MLST genes of the strains were obtained under the accession numbers: P. multocida strains Pm70 (AE004439), HN07 (CP007040), CIRMBP-0884 (CP020345), CIRMBP-0873 (CP020347), HN06 (CP003313) and CQ2 (CP033599); B. bronchiseptica strains F709 (CP020818) and RB50 (BX470250); S. aereus strains ST59 (CP076823) and V8 (CP079715)  Animal experiments  To evaluate the virulence of P. multocida serogroup F isolate s4 in rabbits, groups of animals were subcutaneously or intranasally challenged with 6.0 × 104 colony forming units (CFU) of the s4. All the eight rabbits in the subcutaneous inoculation group survived the challenge, and all of the rabbits showed no clinical signs of disease. The only gross lesion of local subcutaneous abscess at the inoculation site was observed in the all rabbits from the subcutaneous inoculation group (Fig. 2A), and the tissue samples including tracheas, lungs, livers, hearts, spleens, kidneys and blood of the all rabbits from the subcutaneous inoculation group were negative for P. multocida. One rabbit in the intranasal inoculation group developed distinct clinical signs of cough and nasal discharge on 6 days post challenge (Fig. 2B), and the rabbit was caught up in the endpoint on 15 days post challenge because of inability to access feed and water. However, the only clinical sign of matted forepaws was showed in the remaining 7 rabbits in the intranasal inoculation group (Fig. 2C), and the seven rabbits survived the challenge. Gross lesions including hemorrhagic pneumonia (one rabbit) (Fig. 2D), pulmonary consolidation and weak hemorrhagic pneumonia (two rabbits) (Fig. 2E), and weak hemorrhagic pneumonia (five rabbits) (Fig. 2F) were observed in the rabbits in the intranasal inoculation group. The s4 was re-isolated from the following tissue samples collected from rabbits in the intranasal inoculation group: tracheas (n = 8/8), lungs (n = 8/8), livers (n = 8/8), hearts (n = 0/8), spleens (n = 0/8), kidneys (n = 0/8) and blood (n = 0/8). Histologically, inflammatory exudates appeared in the bronchiole and alveoli as well as degeneration of the alveolar epithelial cells were observed in the lung of the rabbit with hemorrhagic pneumonia (Fig. 3A), inflammatory exudates in the bronchiole and alveoli as well as proliferation of alveolar epithelial cells were shown in lungs of the two rabbits with pulmonary consolidation and weak hemorrhagic pneumonia (Fig. 3B), only proliferation of alveolar epithelial cells was shown in lungs of the five rabbits with weak hemorrhagic pneumonia (Fig. 3C). Interestingly, all the eight rabbits in the subcutaneous inoculation group and five rabbits in the intranasal inoculation group were serological positivity for P. multocida IgG on 15 days post challenge. During the 15-day experimental period, all the rabbits in the control group remained P. multocida free, and showed no clinical signs and gross lesions of disease.Fig. 2Clinical signs and gross lesions of the rabbits challenged with s4.

Interestingly, the complete genome of s4 consisted of a chromosome and a plasmid. The complete genome of the s4 has been deposited to the NCBI GenBank database under the accession numbers of CP084165 (chromosome) and CP084164 (plasmid). The chromosome of s4 was 1,781,242 bp in length with the G + C content of 40.42%, in which 1619 protein coding sequences, 45 tRNA genes, 19 rRNA genes, 3 Genomic islands (GIs) and 2 intact prophages were determined (Fig. 4A). The plasmid of s4 was 274,750 bp in length with the G + C content of 39.62%, in which 302 protein coding sequences, 7 tRNA genes, 2 GIs and one intact prophage were determined (Fig. 4B). Interestingly, BLAST analysis showed that the plasmid of s4 was highly homologous (up to 85% identity) with the other P. multocida genomes at nucleotide level (Fig. 5). By blasting against the Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Database (CARD), two elfamycin resistance genes and one cephalosporin resistance gene were predicted, and all of the three drug resistance genes were located in the chromosome of s4.Fig. 4Circular maps of the s4 genome generated by using DNAPlotter.

Therefore, the genome of s4 was compared with that of Pm70. By comparing with the genome of Pm70, gene rearrangement, gain and loss were observed in that of s4. Especially, three large regions (R) of specific sequences were found in the genome of s4 (Fig. 6). Two regions (R1 and R2) located in the chromosome and were approximately 31.9 kb and 37.0 kb in length, respectively. The third region (R3) located in the plasmid and was approximately 42.3 kb in length. Interestingly, all of the three regions located in the intact phage regions that were determined in s4 genome by using PHAST [18]. Additionally, one unique gene (LCY73_01710) encoding the TonB-dependent receptor was identified in the genome of s4 but absent in that of Pm70.Fig. 6Colinear analyses between the genomes of s4 and Pm70. s4-Chr and s4-P represent the chromosome and plasmid of s4, respectively. Rectangle of the same colour indicates the similar local colinear block of the s4 and Pm70. R1, R2 and R3 indicate the three large regions of specific sequences in the genome of s4 but not in that of Pm70  The entire cap locus of s4 were compared with those of Pm70 (capsular type F), HN07 (capsular type F), CIRMBP-0873 (capsular type F), CIRMBP-0884 (capsular type F), CQ2 (capsular type A) and HN06 (capsular type D). The result showed that the entire cap locus of s4 was highly matched with those of capsular type F strains (Pm70, HN07, CIRMBP-0873 and CIRMBP-0884), and the entire cap locus of s4 was closely matched with that of capsular type A strain (CQ2) but was distinct from that of capsular type D strain (HN06) (Fig. 7).Fig. 7Comparative analyses of the entire cap locus between the s4 and other P. multocida strains. The entire cap locus of the s4 were compared with those of Pm70 (capsular type F), HN07 (capsular type F), CIRMBP-0873 (capsular type F), CIRMBP-0884 (capsular type F), CQ2 (capsular type A) and HN06 (capsular type D). The color code represents the BLASTn identity  The LPS outer core biosynthetic genes of s4 were compared with that of Pm70. All of the LPS outer core biosynthetic genes of Pm70 were located in the chromosome, whereas these genes were located in the plasmid of s4. With the exception of natC and gatF, the LPS outer core biosynthetic genes of s4 including gatG, natB, gctC and hptE were highly matched with those of Pm70. Interestingly, an in-frame deletion of 183-bp nucleotide (in positions 559–741) was observed in the natC of s4, which resulted in a deletion of 61 amino acids (in positions 183–243) of the glycosyltransferase NatC of s4 by comparison with that of Pm70 (Fig. 8). Additionally, the gatF of s4 possessed a 210-bp nucleotide sequence redundance at the N-terminal by comparison with that of Pm70 (Fig. 8).Fig. 8Comparative analyses of the LPS outer core locus of s4. The genes required for the assembly of the LPS outer core of s4 were compared with those of CIRMBP-0873 (LPS genotype L3), CIRMBP-0884 (LPS genotype L3) and Pm70 (LPS genotype L3).

PMC9308332,Abstract,Abstract,BX470250,0,0,0,,,"  Background  Pasteurella multocida is one of the most significant pathogens for a number of animals. In rabbits, the infection is generally associated with the P. multocida serogroups A and D, and the knowledge about the serogroup F is limited. In the present study, a P. multocida serogroup F isolate designated s4 was recovered from the lungs of rabbits died of respiratory disease in Fujian, in the southeast of China. The pathogenicity and genomic features of the s4 were then determined.  Results  The serotype and sequence type of s4 were F:L3 and ST12, respectively. The s4 was pathogenic for rabbits, but it was a low virulent strain comparing to the previously reported highly pathogenic P. multocida serogroup F strains J-4103, C21724H3km7, P-4218 and HN07. The whole genome of the s4 was then sequenced to understand the genomic basis for pathogenicity. Particularly, a large-sized fragment of approximate 275 kb in length was truncated from the chromosome to form a plasmid. Moreover, the in-frame deletion of natC and N-terminal redundance of gatF would resulted in the production of a mutant L3 outer core structure that was distinct from those of the other P. multocida strains belonging to the lipopolysaccharide genotype L3. We deduced that these features detected in the genome of s4 might impair the pathogenicity of the bacterium.  Conclusions  This study evaluated the pathogenicity and determined the genomic features of the rabbit sourced P. multocida serogroup F isolate s4, the observations and findings would helpful for the understanding of the pathogenicity variability and genetic diversity of P. multocida.

PMC9308332,Background,Introduction,BX470250,0,0,0,,,"  Background  Pasteurella multocida is recognized as one of the important pathogens for a wide range of animals. The infection of P. multocida is often associated with economically important diseases, such as fowl cholera in poultry, haemorrhagic septicaemia in bovine, progressive atrophic rhinitis in swine, and respiratory disease in rabbit [1, 2]. P. multocida strains can be classified into five capsular serogroups or capsular genotypes (A, B, D, E and F) and further classified into sixteen lipopolysaccharide (LPS) serotypes (1–16) or eight LPS genotypes (L1-L8) [3, 4]. P. multocida strains can also be typed by using the multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) scheme based on the seven housekeeping genes [5, 6]. Rabbit pasteurellosis is generally associated with the strains of capsular serogroups A and D, LPS genotypes L3 and L6, and MLST sequence types ST10, ST11 and ST12 [7, 8]. However, some reports showed that strain of serogroup F that predominately circulated in poultry had also been detected in rabbits, and the bacterium was highly pathogenic for rabbits [9–12].  Rabbit farming is popular in Fujian, in the southeast of China [8, 13]. The number of rabbits farmed and the amount of rabbit meat yielded in Fujian were about 10.67 million and 16.2 thousand tons by the end of 2019 (Fujian Statistical Yearbook, 2020), respectively. Our previous work showed that P. multocida was widespread in rabbits in Fujian, but only strains of serogroups A and D were detected [8]. In July 2020, a respiratory infectious disease broke out on a local rabbit farm in Fujian, and around 500 rabbits died of the disease during a 30-day period. Clinical signs of cough and nasal discharge were observed in the diseased rabbits. Gross pathological lesions including hemorrhagic pneumonia and pulmonary consolidation were showed in the dead rabbits. Four PCR assays were used to screen the potential causative agents including Rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV) [14], P. multocida [3], Bordetella bronchiseptica (B. bronchiseptica) [15] and Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) [16] in the 48 lung samples collected from the dead rabbits. The results showed that the RHDV, B. bronchiseptica and S. aureus were negative, but the P. multocida was positive for the all 48 lung samples and a P. multocida serogroup F isolate named s4 was recovered from the all samples. To our knowledge, the information on the isolation and/or identification of P. multocida serogroup F strain in the rabbits in Fujian is limited, and especially, there was no report concerning the pathogenicity of rabbit sourced P. multocida serogroup F strain isolated from Fujian.  In present study, the s4 was defined by capsular typing, LPS genotyping, MLST, screened virulence factors, and evaluated the pathogenicity in rabbits. Moreover, the whole genome sequence of s4 was determined, and the whole genome comparison between the s4 and the other P. multocida serogroup F strains was performed. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the pathogenicity and determine the genetic features of the rabbit sourced P. multocida serogroup F isolate s4.  ",FALSE,TRUE,

PMC9308332,Discussion,Results and Discussion,BX470250,0,0,0,,,"  Discussion  P. multocida serogroup F was first isolated from turkeys in the USA in 1987 [19], and since then it has been mainly associated with the infections in avian hosts [20–22]. P. multocida is one of the important pathogens results in morbidity and mortality in rabbits, whereas only the serogroups A and D had been previously recognized as the causative agents of rabbit pasteurellosis [7, 12]. It was not until 2008 that the pathogenicity of P. multocida serogroup F for rabbit was documented [12]. Since then, the presence of P. multocida serogroup F has been identified in the important rabbit farming areas worldwide [9–11]. However, the knowledge about the pathogenicity and genetic characteristics of the rabbit sourced P. multocida serogroup F is still limited. In the present study, the pathogenicity of a rabbit sourced P. multocida serogroup F isolate s4 was evaluated and the whole genome of the isolate was sequenced, which would helpful for the understanding of the pathogenitity of rabbit sourced P. multocida serogroup F.  Unexpectedly, the inoculation of s4 did not cause death and result in severe gross lesions in most of the challenged rabbits. The results were in contradict with the previous study, in which the inoculation of rabbit sourced P. multocida serogroup F isolate J-4103 caused high mortality and resulted in severe pathological lesions in most of the challenged rabbits (acute septicemic syndrome and extensive hemorrhage in subcutis in subcutaneously challenged rabbits, and fibrinopurulent pleuropneumonia and extensive hemorrhagic pneumonia in intranasally challenged rabbits) [12]. Moreover, P. multocida serogroup F isolates from chicken (C21724H3km7), turkey (P-4218) and pig (HN07) were also highly virulent to rabbit without prior adaption [23, 24]. The results suggested that the variation in virulence among P. multocida serogroup F strains, and the s4 was a low virulent strain by comparison with the J-4103, C21724H3km7, P-4218 and HN07. Additionally, it should be alert to the potential transmission of P. multocida serogroup F from chicken, turkey and pig into rabbit, which might cause high mortality and subsequent huge economic loss to rabbit farming.  P. multocida possesses a number of virulence genes, which contributes to the fitness and pathogenicity of the pathogen [1]. The s4 carried a panel of virulence genes including ptfA, tadD, hgbB, ompA, omph and oma87. The ptfA, tadD, ompA, omph and oma87 encode the proteins that are associated with P. multocida virulence because of their roles in the attachment and colonization of host [25, 26]. The hgbB encodes an outer membrane protein, which is involved in iron acquisition [25]. Interestingly, the P. multocida serogroup D isolates carrying the hgbB were significantly associated with the clinical presentation of respiratory disease in rabbits [9]. Additionally, comparative genomic analyses between s4 and Pm70 identified a unique gene in s4 but absent in Pm70. The unique gene (LCY73_01710) encoded TonB-dependent receptor that is essential for transport of organic iron chelators (siderophores) into the periplasm to establish commensal and pathogenic relationships with the hosts [27]. In Pm70, more than 2.5% of the genome was devoted to genes encoding proteins involved in iron uptake and acquisition, suggesting that iron uptake and acquisition is important for P. multocida survival and pathogenesis [17]. Taken together, the presence of these genes might contribute to the pathogenicity of the s4.  The complete genome of s4 was sequenced and then the comparative genomic analyses were performed to better understand the genetic basis for the pathogenicity of s4. The genome of s4 shared a high level of DNA identity to that of Pm70. However, the genome of s4 was smaller (approximate 200 kb) than that of Pm70, which might result in the loss of a number of functional genes and subsequently impaired the pathogenicity of the s4. Interestingly, the s4 possessed a plasmid of approximate 275 kb in length, and the sequence of the plasmid shared a high level of DNA identity (up to 90% identity) to the plasmid (approximate 325 kb in length) of rabbit sourced P. multocida serogroup F strain CIRMBP-0884. Additionally, the plasmids of the rabbit sourced P. multocida serogroup F strains s4 and CIRMBP-0884 were highly identical (up to 85% indentity) to the other P. multocida genomes at nucleotide level. Therefore, it was deduced that the sequences of the plasmids of s4 and CIRMBP-0884 might derive from their own genomes. Interestingly, only a small number of P. multocida strains possess plasmids according to the P. multocida genomes deposited in the NCBI genome database. The plasmids of P. multocida strains often carry antibiotic resistance genes and mobilization genes [28], and plasmids of some P. multocida strains carry the toxA gene encoding the dermonecrotic toxin [28]. Unexpectedly, the antibiotic resistance genes, mobilization genes and toxin gene were not determined in the plasmid of s4.  LPS is an important virulence determinant of P. multocida [29]. The LPS of the s4 belongs to the genotype of L3. It was showed that P. multocida strains belonging to the LPS genotype L3 might be highly virulent because these strains were the most common causative agents of fowl cholera [4, 29]. The L3 outer core structure is similar to the self-antigen of host, which facilitates the bacteria evading the host innate immune system [29]. The in-frame deletion of natC and the N-terminal redundance of gatF would result in the production of a mutant L3 outer core structure, which might contribute to the low pathogenicity of s4. Interestingly, the genetic diversities of natC and gatF from P. multocida serogroup F:L3 strains of CIRMBP-0873, CIRMBP-0884 and HN07 were also detected (Fig. 8) [30]. Taken together, the effects of the polymorphism in the LPS outer core genes natC and gatF on the pathogenicity of P. multocida would be worth eliciting in the further work.  Fig. 8Comparative analyses of the LPS outer core locus of s4. The genes required for the assembly of the LPS outer core of s4 were compared with those of CIRMBP-0873 (LPS genotype L3), CIRMBP-0884 (LPS genotype L3) and Pm70 (LPS genotype L3).

Each lung sample was placed in a sterile tube, kept on ice and delivered to our lab for examination within 24 h. Each lung sample was homogenized to make a 50% suspension in sterile normal saline. For the detection of RHDV, the suspension was centrifuged at 1500×g for 15 min at 4 °C, and two hundred microliter of the supernatant was collected and used for viral RNA extraction using the EasyPure Viral DNA/RNA kit (TransGen Biotech, Beijing, China). The extracted viral RNA was reverse-transcribed to complementary DNA (cDNA) using the EasyScript Reverse Transciptase (TransGen Biotech, Beijing, China) by using the Oligo-dT18 as the primer. The synthetic cDNA was used as the genomic template to screen the presence of the RHDV in the lung samples by using the PCR assay described by Schwensow et al. [14]. For the detection of P. multocida, B. bronchiseptica and S. aureus, one hundred microliter of lung suspension was centrifuged at 5000×g for 10 min at room temperature, and the pellet was used for bacterial DNA extraction using the EasyPure Bacteria Genomic DNA kit (TransGen Biotech, Beijing, China). The extracted DNA was used as the genomic template to screen the presence of the P. multocida, B. bronchiseptica and S. aureus in the lung samples by using the PCR assays described by Townsend et al. [3], Wang et al. [15] and Brakstad et al. [16], respectively.  P. multocida isolation and identification  One hundred microliter of the lung suspension was spread on the BHI agar plate containing 5% defibrinated sheep blood and incubated at 37 °C for 24 to 48 h. Three isolates from each plate were randomly picked up and each isolate was inoculated in 5 mL of BHI containing 2% bovine serum. Then, the isolates were shaken at the conditions of 180 rpm and 37 °C for 24 h. To confirm the identities of the isolates, the 16S rRNA genes of the isolates were amplified and sequenced [31], and the capsular types and LPS genotypes of the isolates were defined using the PCR assays described by Townsend et al. [3] and Harper et al. [4], respectively.  MLST  The MLST analyses of the isolates were conducted using the Multi-host MLST scheme described in the PubMLST (https://pubmlst.org/pmultocida/). The genomic DNA of the isolates were prepared using the EasyPure Bacteria Genomic DNA kit (TransGen Biotech, Beijing, China), and the seven housekeeping genes including adk, aroA, deoD, gdhA, g6pd, mdh and pgi of each isolate were amplified from the genomic DNA of the isolates. The expected PCR products were purified and subjected to sequence. The allelic profile of each isolate was defined by comparing the sequences of the 7 housekeeping genes of each isolate to the corresponding known sequences in the PubMLST database. The sequence type of each isolate was then defined by submitting the allelic profile to the PubMLST database.  Virulence genes detection  The genomic DNA of the isolates were prepared using the EasyPure Bacteria Genomic DNA kit (TransGen Biotech, Beijing, China) and were screened for the presence of twelve virulence genes including adhesion related proteins (ptfA, tadD and pfhA), dermonecrotoxin (toxA), iron binding proteins (fur, tbpA and hgbB), sialidases (nanB), hyaluronidase (pmHAS) and outer membrane proteins (ompA, ompH and oma87). Primers used for ptfA, tadD, pfhA, toxA, fur, nanB, pmHAS, ompA, ompH and oma87 were described by Tang et al. [26]. Primers used for tbpA and hgbB were described by Ewers et al. [25]. The expected PCR products were purified and sequenced, and the identities of these products were confirmed by comparing the sequences against the NCBI GenBank database.  Animal experiments  Twenty-four 30-day-old rabbits obtained from a local rabbit farm were randomly divided into three groups (subcutaneous inoculation group, intranasal inoculation group and negative control group) of eight rabbits each (four males and four females). Each group was placed in a separate room, and two rabbits (one male and one female) from the same group were kept in a cage. Before infection, nasal, conjunctival and rectal swabs as well as whole blood were collected for bacteriological detection to ensure P. multocida-free status of the rabbits [12]. The sera of the rabbits were also tested for the presence of P. multocida IgG as described by Jaglic et al. [12].  Rabbits in groups of subcutaneous inoculation group and intranasal inoculation group were subcutaneously and intranasally inoculated with 6.0 × 104 CFU of the isolate suspended in 100 μL of sterile normal saline, respectively. Rabbits in the negative control group were intranasally inoculated with 100 μL of sterile normal saline. The challenge does and routs were selected as described by Jaglic et al. [12, 23]. The clinical signs including cough, nasal discharge and dyspnea were monitored twice daily for 15 days for the all rabbits. At the end of the experiment, the gross lesions of the all rabbits were examined and tissue samples including tracheas, lungs, livers, hearts, spleens, kidneys and whole blood of all rabbits were collected for bacteriological examination, and the sera was used for serological examination as described by Jaglic et al. [12]. Lung samples from the rabbits of intranasal inoculation group were histologically examined using hematoxylin-eosin staining.  Prior to challenge, all the rabbits were anaesthetized with intravenous injection of ketamine (40 mg/kg). Rabbits that were caught up in the endpoint (dyspnoea, weight loss of 15% or inability to access feed or water), and rabbits that survived until the 15 days were also sacrificed under ketamine narcosis to minimize sufferings.  Genome sequencing and comparative analysis  The whole genome of the isolate was sequenced using PacBio system (Pacific Biosciences, USA) at Shanghai Majorbio Bio-Pharm Technology Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). The PacBio system generated 244,686 total reads and 1,833,208,095 total bases, with the average reads length of 7492.08 bases and the average genome coverage of 891-fold. The raw reads were analyzed on the Majorbio Cloud Platform (www.majorbio.com), and then the complete genome of the isolate was de novo assembled. The complete genome of the isolate was annotated using the NCBI Prokaryotic Genome Annotation Pipeline. Genomic island and prophage were determined using IslandViewer 4 [32] and PHAST [18], respectively. Drug resistance genes were determined by comparing the sequence of the isolate against the comprehensive antibiotic resistance database (CARD) (https://card.mcmaster.ca/). The circular genome map of the isolate was plotted using DNAPlotter (version 17.0.1) [33]. The complete genomes of the P. multocida strains CQ2 (capsular serogroup A), HN06 (capsular serogroup D), Pm70 (capsular serogroup F), HN07 (capsular serogroup F), CIRMBP-0873 (capsular serogroup F) and CIRMBP-0884 (capsular serogroup F) were freely obtained from NCBI database under the accession numbers of CP033599, CP003313, AE004439, CP007040, CP020347 and CP020345, respectively. The whole genome comparison between the isolate and these strains was performed by using progressiveMauve alignment procedure on Mauve (version 2.4.0) [34], BLAST (version 2.4.0) [35], BRIG (version 0.95-dist) [36] and Easyfig (version 2.2.5) [37].

PMC9308332,Results,Results and Discussion,BX470250,1,0,0,,,"  Results  P. multocida isolation and identification  The presence of the potential pathogens including RHDV, P. multocida, B. bronchiseptica and S. aureus in the 48 lung samples collected from the natural infected dead rabbits were determined by using PCR assays. The results showed that RHDV, B. bronchiseptica and S. aureus were negative for the all 48 lung samples, whereas P. multocida was positive for the all 48 lung samples. All the lung samples were then subjected to P. multocida isolation.  All the 48 lung samples produced identical bacterial colonies on brain heart infusion (BHI) blood agar plate. The colonies were grey, round, smooth and less than 1 mm in diameter. Three colonies from each lung sample were randomly picked up. The sequences of the 16S rRNA genes of the 144 isolates recovered from the 48 lung samples were identical and shared the highest identity (range from 99.90 to 100%) with that of P. multocida. The PCR assays for capsular and LPS typing of the isolates yielded segments of approximate 850 bp and 470 bp in length, and the sequences of the two segments were 100% identical with the fcbD and gatF of P. multocida, respectively. The results indicated that the 144 isolates were P. multocida serotype F:L3.  MLST  The allelic numbers of the 7 housekeeping genes (adk, aroA, deoD, gdhA, g6pd, mdh and pgi) of the 144 isolates were identical and assigned as 8–8–5-3-5-7-5, and the sequence types of the 144 isolates were then defined as ST12.  Virulence genes detection  The virulence genes ptfA, tadD, hgbB, ompA, omph and oma87 were positive for the 144 isolates, whereas the virulence genes pfhA, toxA, fur, tbpA, nanB and pmHAS were negative for the all isolates. The sequence of each of the virulence genes (ptfA, tadD, hgbB, ompA, omph and oma87) of the 144 isolates were identical, and the sequences of these six virulence genes shared highest identity (ranged from 99.90 to 100%) with the corresponding virulence genes of P. multocida.  Taken together, the serotypes, sequence types and the virulence gene profiles of the 144 isolates were identical, suggesting that all the isolates were derived from the same progenitor (Fig. 1). In this study, one of the isolates named s4 was selected as the representative for the following animal experiments and whole genome sequencing.Fig. 1Neighbour-joining tree indicating the position of P. multocida isolate s4 based on the seven MLST genes. The seven MLST genes of P. multocida (adk, aroA, deoD, gdhA, g6pd, mdh and pgi), B. bronchiseptica (adk, fumC, glyA, tyrB, icd, pepA and pgm) and S. aureus (arcC, aroE, glpF, gmk, pta, tpi and yqiL) were concatenated, and then the neighbour-joining tree was constructed using MEGA 5.0 (1000 of bootstrap replications). The senve MLST genes of the strains were obtained under the accession numbers: P. multocida strains Pm70 (AE004439), HN07 (CP007040), CIRMBP-0884 (CP020345), CIRMBP-0873 (CP020347), HN06 (CP003313) and CQ2 (CP033599); B. bronchiseptica strains F709 (CP020818) and RB50 (BX470250); S. aereus strains ST59 (CP076823) and V8 (CP079715)  Animal experiments  To evaluate the virulence of P. multocida serogroup F isolate s4 in rabbits, groups of animals were subcutaneously or intranasally challenged with 6.0 × 104 colony forming units (CFU) of the s4. All the eight rabbits in the subcutaneous inoculation group survived the challenge, and all of the rabbits showed no clinical signs of disease. The only gross lesion of local subcutaneous abscess at the inoculation site was observed in the all rabbits from the subcutaneous inoculation group (Fig. 2A), and the tissue samples including tracheas, lungs, livers, hearts, spleens, kidneys and blood of the all rabbits from the subcutaneous inoculation group were negative for P. multocida. One rabbit in the intranasal inoculation group developed distinct clinical signs of cough and nasal discharge on 6 days post challenge (Fig. 2B), and the rabbit was caught up in the endpoint on 15 days post challenge because of inability to access feed and water. However, the only clinical sign of matted forepaws was showed in the remaining 7 rabbits in the intranasal inoculation group (Fig. 2C), and the seven rabbits survived the challenge. Gross lesions including hemorrhagic pneumonia (one rabbit) (Fig. 2D), pulmonary consolidation and weak hemorrhagic pneumonia (two rabbits) (Fig. 2E), and weak hemorrhagic pneumonia (five rabbits) (Fig. 2F) were observed in the rabbits in the intranasal inoculation group. The s4 was re-isolated from the following tissue samples collected from rabbits in the intranasal inoculation group: tracheas (n = 8/8), lungs (n = 8/8), livers (n = 8/8), hearts (n = 0/8), spleens (n = 0/8), kidneys (n = 0/8) and blood (n = 0/8). Histologically, inflammatory exudates appeared in the bronchiole and alveoli as well as degeneration of the alveolar epithelial cells were observed in the lung of the rabbit with hemorrhagic pneumonia (Fig. 3A), inflammatory exudates in the bronchiole and alveoli as well as proliferation of alveolar epithelial cells were shown in lungs of the two rabbits with pulmonary consolidation and weak hemorrhagic pneumonia (Fig. 3B), only proliferation of alveolar epithelial cells was shown in lungs of the five rabbits with weak hemorrhagic pneumonia (Fig. 3C). Interestingly, all the eight rabbits in the subcutaneous inoculation group and five rabbits in the intranasal inoculation group were serological positivity for P. multocida IgG on 15 days post challenge. During the 15-day experimental period, all the rabbits in the control group remained P. multocida free, and showed no clinical signs and gross lesions of disease.Fig. 2Clinical signs and gross lesions of the rabbits challenged with s4.

Interestingly, the complete genome of s4 consisted of a chromosome and a plasmid. The complete genome of the s4 has been deposited to the NCBI GenBank database under the accession numbers of CP084165 (chromosome) and CP084164 (plasmid). The chromosome of s4 was 1,781,242 bp in length with the G + C content of 40.42%, in which 1619 protein coding sequences, 45 tRNA genes, 19 rRNA genes, 3 Genomic islands (GIs) and 2 intact prophages were determined (Fig. 4A). The plasmid of s4 was 274,750 bp in length with the G + C content of 39.62%, in which 302 protein coding sequences, 7 tRNA genes, 2 GIs and one intact prophage were determined (Fig. 4B). Interestingly, BLAST analysis showed that the plasmid of s4 was highly homologous (up to 85% identity) with the other P. multocida genomes at nucleotide level (Fig. 5). By blasting against the Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Database (CARD), two elfamycin resistance genes and one cephalosporin resistance gene were predicted, and all of the three drug resistance genes were located in the chromosome of s4.Fig. 4Circular maps of the s4 genome generated by using DNAPlotter.

Therefore, the genome of s4 was compared with that of Pm70. By comparing with the genome of Pm70, gene rearrangement, gain and loss were observed in that of s4. Especially, three large regions (R) of specific sequences were found in the genome of s4 (Fig. 6). Two regions (R1 and R2) located in the chromosome and were approximately 31.9 kb and 37.0 kb in length, respectively. The third region (R3) located in the plasmid and was approximately 42.3 kb in length. Interestingly, all of the three regions located in the intact phage regions that were determined in s4 genome by using PHAST [18]. Additionally, one unique gene (LCY73_01710) encoding the TonB-dependent receptor was identified in the genome of s4 but absent in that of Pm70.Fig. 6Colinear analyses between the genomes of s4 and Pm70. s4-Chr and s4-P represent the chromosome and plasmid of s4, respectively. Rectangle of the same colour indicates the similar local colinear block of the s4 and Pm70. R1, R2 and R3 indicate the three large regions of specific sequences in the genome of s4 but not in that of Pm70  The entire cap locus of s4 were compared with those of Pm70 (capsular type F), HN07 (capsular type F), CIRMBP-0873 (capsular type F), CIRMBP-0884 (capsular type F), CQ2 (capsular type A) and HN06 (capsular type D). The result showed that the entire cap locus of s4 was highly matched with those of capsular type F strains (Pm70, HN07, CIRMBP-0873 and CIRMBP-0884), and the entire cap locus of s4 was closely matched with that of capsular type A strain (CQ2) but was distinct from that of capsular type D strain (HN06) (Fig. 7).Fig. 7Comparative analyses of the entire cap locus between the s4 and other P. multocida strains. The entire cap locus of the s4 were compared with those of Pm70 (capsular type F), HN07 (capsular type F), CIRMBP-0873 (capsular type F), CIRMBP-0884 (capsular type F), CQ2 (capsular type A) and HN06 (capsular type D). The color code represents the BLASTn identity  The LPS outer core biosynthetic genes of s4 were compared with that of Pm70. All of the LPS outer core biosynthetic genes of Pm70 were located in the chromosome, whereas these genes were located in the plasmid of s4. With the exception of natC and gatF, the LPS outer core biosynthetic genes of s4 including gatG, natB, gctC and hptE were highly matched with those of Pm70. Interestingly, an in-frame deletion of 183-bp nucleotide (in positions 559–741) was observed in the natC of s4, which resulted in a deletion of 61 amino acids (in positions 183–243) of the glycosyltransferase NatC of s4 by comparison with that of Pm70 (Fig. 8). Additionally, the gatF of s4 possessed a 210-bp nucleotide sequence redundance at the N-terminal by comparison with that of Pm70 (Fig. 8).Fig. 8Comparative analyses of the LPS outer core locus of s4. The genes required for the assembly of the LPS outer core of s4 were compared with those of CIRMBP-0873 (LPS genotype L3), CIRMBP-0884 (LPS genotype L3) and Pm70 (LPS genotype L3).

PMC9308332,Abstract,Abstract,CP003313,0,0,0,,,"  Background  Pasteurella multocida is one of the most significant pathogens for a number of animals. In rabbits, the infection is generally associated with the P. multocida serogroups A and D, and the knowledge about the serogroup F is limited. In the present study, a P. multocida serogroup F isolate designated s4 was recovered from the lungs of rabbits died of respiratory disease in Fujian, in the southeast of China. The pathogenicity and genomic features of the s4 were then determined.  Results  The serotype and sequence type of s4 were F:L3 and ST12, respectively. The s4 was pathogenic for rabbits, but it was a low virulent strain comparing to the previously reported highly pathogenic P. multocida serogroup F strains J-4103, C21724H3km7, P-4218 and HN07. The whole genome of the s4 was then sequenced to understand the genomic basis for pathogenicity. Particularly, a large-sized fragment of approximate 275 kb in length was truncated from the chromosome to form a plasmid. Moreover, the in-frame deletion of natC and N-terminal redundance of gatF would resulted in the production of a mutant L3 outer core structure that was distinct from those of the other P. multocida strains belonging to the lipopolysaccharide genotype L3. We deduced that these features detected in the genome of s4 might impair the pathogenicity of the bacterium.  Conclusions  This study evaluated the pathogenicity and determined the genomic features of the rabbit sourced P. multocida serogroup F isolate s4, the observations and findings would helpful for the understanding of the pathogenicity variability and genetic diversity of P. multocida.

The infection of P. multocida is often associated with economically important diseases, such as fowl cholera in poultry, haemorrhagic septicaemia in bovine, progressive atrophic rhinitis in swine, and respiratory disease in rabbit [1, 2]. P. multocida strains can be classified into five capsular serogroups or capsular genotypes (A, B, D, E and F) and further classified into sixteen lipopolysaccharide (LPS) serotypes (1–16) or eight LPS genotypes (L1-L8) [3, 4]. P. multocida strains can also be typed by using the multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) scheme based on the seven housekeeping genes [5, 6]. Rabbit pasteurellosis is generally associated with the strains of capsular serogroups A and D, LPS genotypes L3 and L6, and MLST sequence types ST10, ST11 and ST12 [7, 8]. However, some reports showed that strain of serogroup F that predominately circulated in poultry had also been detected in rabbits, and the bacterium was highly pathogenic for rabbits [9–12].  Rabbit farming is popular in Fujian, in the southeast of China [8, 13]. The number of rabbits farmed and the amount of rabbit meat yielded in Fujian were about 10.67 million and 16.2 thousand tons by the end of 2019 (Fujian Statistical Yearbook, 2020), respectively. Our previous work showed that P. multocida was widespread in rabbits in Fujian, but only strains of serogroups A and D were detected [8]. In July 2020, a respiratory infectious disease broke out on a local rabbit farm in Fujian, and around 500 rabbits died of the disease during a 30-day period. Clinical signs of cough and nasal discharge were observed in the diseased rabbits. Gross pathological lesions including hemorrhagic pneumonia and pulmonary consolidation were showed in the dead rabbits. Four PCR assays were used to screen the potential causative agents including Rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV) [14], P. multocida [3], Bordetella bronchiseptica (B. bronchiseptica) [15] and Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) [16] in the 48 lung samples collected from the dead rabbits. The results showed that the RHDV, B. bronchiseptica and S. aureus were negative, but the P. multocida was positive for the all 48 lung samples and a P. multocida serogroup F isolate named s4 was recovered from the all samples. To our knowledge, the information on the isolation and/or identification of P. multocida serogroup F strain in the rabbits in Fujian is limited, and especially, there was no report concerning the pathogenicity of rabbit sourced P. multocida serogroup F strain isolated from Fujian.  In present study, the s4 was defined by capsular typing, LPS genotyping, MLST, screened virulence factors, and evaluated the pathogenicity in rabbits. Moreover, the whole genome sequence of s4 was determined, and the whole genome comparison between the s4 and the other P. multocida serogroup F strains was performed. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the pathogenicity and determine the genetic features of the rabbit sourced P. multocida serogroup F isolate s4.  ",FALSE,TRUE,

""Interestingly, only a small number of P. multocida strains possess plasmids according to the P. multocida genomes deposited in the NCBI genome database.""","  Discussion  P. multocida serogroup F was first isolated from turkeys in the USA in 1987 [19], and since then it has been mainly associated with the infections in avian hosts [20–22]. P. multocida is one of the important pathogens results in morbidity and mortality in rabbits, whereas only the serogroups A and D had been previously recognized as the causative agents of rabbit pasteurellosis [7, 12]. It was not until 2008 that the pathogenicity of P. multocida serogroup F for rabbit was documented [12]. Since then, the presence of P. multocida serogroup F has been identified in the important rabbit farming areas worldwide [9–11]. However, the knowledge about the pathogenicity and genetic characteristics of the rabbit sourced P. multocida serogroup F is still limited. In the present study, the pathogenicity of a rabbit sourced P. multocida serogroup F isolate s4 was evaluated and the whole genome of the isolate was sequenced, which would helpful for the understanding of the pathogenitity of rabbit sourced P. multocida serogroup F.  Unexpectedly, the inoculation of s4 did not cause death and result in severe gross lesions in most of the challenged rabbits. The results were in contradict with the previous study, in which the inoculation of rabbit sourced P. multocida serogroup F isolate J-4103 caused high mortality and resulted in severe pathological lesions in most of the challenged rabbits (acute septicemic syndrome and extensive hemorrhage in subcutis in subcutaneously challenged rabbits, and fibrinopurulent pleuropneumonia and extensive hemorrhagic pneumonia in intranasally challenged rabbits) [12]. Moreover, P. multocida serogroup F isolates from chicken (C21724H3km7), turkey (P-4218) and pig (HN07) were also highly virulent to rabbit without prior adaption [23, 24]. The results suggested that the variation in virulence among P. multocida serogroup F strains, and the s4 was a low virulent strain by comparison with the J-4103, C21724H3km7, P-4218 and HN07. Additionally, it should be alert to the potential transmission of P. multocida serogroup F from chicken, turkey and pig into rabbit, which might cause high mortality and subsequent huge economic loss to rabbit farming.  P. multocida possesses a number of virulence genes, which contributes to the fitness and pathogenicity of the pathogen [1]. The s4 carried a panel of virulence genes including ptfA, tadD, hgbB, ompA, omph and oma87. The ptfA, tadD, ompA, omph and oma87 encode the proteins that are associated with P. multocida virulence because of their roles in the attachment and colonization of host [25, 26]. The hgbB encodes an outer membrane protein, which is involved in iron acquisition [25]. Interestingly, the P. multocida serogroup D isolates carrying the hgbB were significantly associated with the clinical presentation of respiratory disease in rabbits [9]. Additionally, comparative genomic analyses between s4 and Pm70 identified a unique gene in s4 but absent in Pm70. The unique gene (LCY73_01710) encoded TonB-dependent receptor that is essential for transport of organic iron chelators (siderophores) into the periplasm to establish commensal and pathogenic relationships with the hosts [27]. In Pm70, more than 2.5% of the genome was devoted to genes encoding proteins involved in iron uptake and acquisition, suggesting that iron uptake and acquisition is important for P. multocida survival and pathogenesis [17]. Taken together, the presence of these genes might contribute to the pathogenicity of the s4.  The complete genome of s4 was sequenced and then the comparative genomic analyses were performed to better understand the genetic basis for the pathogenicity of s4. The genome of s4 shared a high level of DNA identity to that of Pm70. However, the genome of s4 was smaller (approximate 200 kb) than that of Pm70, which might result in the loss of a number of functional genes and subsequently impaired the pathogenicity of the s4. Interestingly, the s4 possessed a plasmid of approximate 275 kb in length, and the sequence of the plasmid shared a high level of DNA identity (up to 90% identity) to the plasmid (approximate 325 kb in length) of rabbit sourced P. multocida serogroup F strain CIRMBP-0884. Additionally, the plasmids of the rabbit sourced P. multocida serogroup F strains s4 and CIRMBP-0884 were highly identical (up to 85% indentity) to the other P. multocida genomes at nucleotide level. Therefore, it was deduced that the sequences of the plasmids of s4 and CIRMBP-0884 might derive from their own genomes. Interestingly, only a small number of P. multocida strains possess plasmids according to the P. multocida genomes deposited in the NCBI genome database. The plasmids of P. multocida strains often carry antibiotic resistance genes and mobilization genes [28], and plasmids of some P. multocida strains carry the toxA gene encoding the dermonecrotic toxin [28]. Unexpectedly, the antibiotic resistance genes, mobilization genes and toxin gene were not determined in the plasmid of s4.  LPS is an important virulence determinant of P. multocida [29]. The LPS of the s4 belongs to the genotype of L3. It was showed that P. multocida strains belonging to the LPS genotype L3 might be highly virulent because these strains were the most common causative agents of fowl cholera [4, 29]. The L3 outer core structure is similar to the self-antigen of host, which facilitates the bacteria evading the host innate immune system [29]. The in-frame deletion of natC and the N-terminal redundance of gatF would result in the production of a mutant L3 outer core structure, which might contribute to the low pathogenicity of s4. Interestingly, the genetic diversities of natC and gatF from P. multocida serogroup F:L3 strains of CIRMBP-0873, CIRMBP-0884 and HN07 were also detected (Fig. 8) [30]. Taken together, the effects of the polymorphism in the LPS outer core genes natC and gatF on the pathogenicity of P. multocida would be worth eliciting in the further work.  Fig. 8Comparative analyses of the LPS outer core locus of s4. The genes required for the assembly of the LPS outer core of s4 were compared with those of CIRMBP-0873 (LPS genotype L3), CIRMBP-0884 (LPS genotype L3) and Pm70 (LPS genotype L3).

""The expected PCR products were purified and sequenced, and the identities of these products were confirmed by comparing the sequences against the NCBI GenBank database.""","  Methods  Sample collection and detection of potential pathogen  A total of 48 lung samples were collected from the naturally infected dead rabbits. Each lung sample was placed in a sterile tube, kept on ice and delivered to our lab for examination within 24 h. Each lung sample was homogenized to make a 50% suspension in sterile normal saline. For the detection of RHDV, the suspension was centrifuged at 1500×g for 15 min at 4 °C, and two hundred microliter of the supernatant was collected and used for viral RNA extraction using the EasyPure Viral DNA/RNA kit (TransGen Biotech, Beijing, China). The extracted viral RNA was reverse-transcribed to complementary DNA (cDNA) using the EasyScript Reverse Transciptase (TransGen Biotech, Beijing, China) by using the Oligo-dT18 as the primer. The synthetic cDNA was used as the genomic template to screen the presence of the RHDV in the lung samples by using the PCR assay described by Schwensow et al. [14]. For the detection of P. multocida, B. bronchiseptica and S. aureus, one hundred microliter of lung suspension was centrifuged at 5000×g for 10 min at room temperature, and the pellet was used for bacterial DNA extraction using the EasyPure Bacteria Genomic DNA kit (TransGen Biotech, Beijing, China). The extracted DNA was used as the genomic template to screen the presence of the P. multocida, B. bronchiseptica and S. aureus in the lung samples by using the PCR assays described by Townsend et al. [3], Wang et al. [15] and Brakstad et al. [16], respectively.  P. multocida isolation and identification  One hundred microliter of the lung suspension was spread on the BHI agar plate containing 5% defibrinated sheep blood and incubated at 37 °C for 24 to 48 h. Three isolates from each plate were randomly picked up and each isolate was inoculated in 5 mL of BHI containing 2% bovine serum. Then, the isolates were shaken at the conditions of 180 rpm and 37 °C for 24 h. To confirm the identities of the isolates, the 16S rRNA genes of the isolates were amplified and sequenced [31], and the capsular types and LPS genotypes of the isolates were defined using the PCR assays described by Townsend et al. [3] and Harper et al. [4], respectively.  MLST  The MLST analyses of the isolates were conducted using the Multi-host MLST scheme described in the PubMLST (https://pubmlst.org/pmultocida/). The genomic DNA of the isolates were prepared using the EasyPure Bacteria Genomic DNA kit (TransGen Biotech, Beijing, China), and the seven housekeeping genes including adk, aroA, deoD, gdhA, g6pd, mdh and pgi of each isolate were amplified from the genomic DNA of the isolates. The expected PCR products were purified and subjected to sequence. The allelic profile of each isolate was defined by comparing the sequences of the 7 housekeeping genes of each isolate to the corresponding known sequences in the PubMLST database. The sequence type of each isolate was then defined by submitting the allelic profile to the PubMLST database.  Virulence genes detection  The genomic DNA of the isolates were prepared using the EasyPure Bacteria Genomic DNA kit (TransGen Biotech, Beijing, China) and were screened for the presence of twelve virulence genes including adhesion related proteins (ptfA, tadD and pfhA), dermonecrotoxin (toxA), iron binding proteins (fur, tbpA and hgbB), sialidases (nanB), hyaluronidase (pmHAS) and outer membrane proteins (ompA, ompH and oma87). Primers used for ptfA, tadD, pfhA, toxA, fur, nanB, pmHAS, ompA, ompH and oma87 were described by Tang et al. [26]. Primers used for tbpA and hgbB were described by Ewers et al. [25]. The expected PCR products were purified and sequenced, and the identities of these products were confirmed by comparing the sequences against the NCBI GenBank database.  Animal experiments  Twenty-four 30-day-old rabbits obtained from a local rabbit farm were randomly divided into three groups (subcutaneous inoculation group, intranasal inoculation group and negative control group) of eight rabbits each (four males and four females). Each group was placed in a separate room, and two rabbits (one male and one female) from the same group were kept in a cage. Before infection, nasal, conjunctival and rectal swabs as well as whole blood were collected for bacteriological detection to ensure P. multocida-free status of the rabbits [12]. The sera of the rabbits were also tested for the presence of P. multocida IgG as described by Jaglic et al. [12].  Rabbits in groups of subcutaneous inoculation group and intranasal inoculation group were subcutaneously and intranasally inoculated with 6.0 × 104 CFU of the isolate suspended in 100 μL of sterile normal saline, respectively. Rabbits in the negative control group were intranasally inoculated with 100 μL of sterile normal saline. The challenge does and routs were selected as described by Jaglic et al. [12, 23]. The clinical signs including cough, nasal discharge and dyspnea were monitored twice daily for 15 days for the all rabbits. At the end of the experiment, the gross lesions of the all rabbits were examined and tissue samples including tracheas, lungs, livers, hearts, spleens, kidneys and whole blood of all rabbits were collected for bacteriological examination, and the sera was used for serological examination as described by Jaglic et al. [12]. Lung samples from the rabbits of intranasal inoculation group were histologically examined using hematoxylin-eosin staining.  Prior to challenge, all the rabbits were anaesthetized with intravenous injection of ketamine (40 mg/kg). Rabbits that were caught up in the endpoint (dyspnoea, weight loss of 15% or inability to access feed or water), and rabbits that survived until the 15 days were also sacrificed under ketamine narcosis to minimize sufferings.  Genome sequencing and comparative analysis  The whole genome of the isolate was sequenced using PacBio system (Pacific Biosciences, USA) at Shanghai Majorbio Bio-Pharm Technology Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). The PacBio system generated 244,686 total reads and 1,833,208,095 total bases, with the average reads length of 7492.08 bases and the average genome coverage of 891-fold. The raw reads were analyzed on the Majorbio Cloud Platform (www.majorbio.com), and then the complete genome of the isolate was de novo assembled. The complete genome of the isolate was annotated using the NCBI Prokaryotic Genome Annotation Pipeline. Genomic island and prophage were determined using IslandViewer 4 [32] and PHAST [18], respectively. Drug resistance genes were determined by comparing the sequence of the isolate against the comprehensive antibiotic resistance database (CARD) (https://card.mcmaster.ca/). The circular genome map of the isolate was plotted using DNAPlotter (version 17.0.1) [33]. The complete genomes of the P. multocida strains CQ2 (capsular serogroup A), HN06 (capsular serogroup D), Pm70 (capsular serogroup F), HN07 (capsular serogroup F), CIRMBP-0873 (capsular serogroup F) and CIRMBP-0884 (capsular serogroup F) were freely obtained from NCBI database under the accession numbers of CP033599, CP003313, AE004439, CP007040, CP020347 and CP020345, respectively. The whole genome comparison between the isolate and these strains was performed by using progressiveMauve alignment procedure on Mauve (version 2.4.0) [34], BLAST (version 2.4.0) [35], BRIG (version 0.95-dist) [36] and Easyfig (version 2.2.5) [37].

The results showed that RHDV, B. bronchiseptica and S. aureus were negative for the all 48 lung samples, whereas P. multocida was positive for the all 48 lung samples. All the lung samples were then subjected to P. multocida isolation.  All the 48 lung samples produced identical bacterial colonies on brain heart infusion (BHI) blood agar plate. The colonies were grey, round, smooth and less than 1 mm in diameter. Three colonies from each lung sample were randomly picked up. The sequences of the 16S rRNA genes of the 144 isolates recovered from the 48 lung samples were identical and shared the highest identity (range from 99.90 to 100%) with that of P. multocida. The PCR assays for capsular and LPS typing of the isolates yielded segments of approximate 850 bp and 470 bp in length, and the sequences of the two segments were 100% identical with the fcbD and gatF of P. multocida, respectively. The results indicated that the 144 isolates were P. multocida serotype F:L3.  MLST  The allelic numbers of the 7 housekeeping genes (adk, aroA, deoD, gdhA, g6pd, mdh and pgi) of the 144 isolates were identical and assigned as 8–8–5-3-5-7-5, and the sequence types of the 144 isolates were then defined as ST12.  Virulence genes detection  The virulence genes ptfA, tadD, hgbB, ompA, omph and oma87 were positive for the 144 isolates, whereas the virulence genes pfhA, toxA, fur, tbpA, nanB and pmHAS were negative for the all isolates. The sequence of each of the virulence genes (ptfA, tadD, hgbB, ompA, omph and oma87) of the 144 isolates were identical, and the sequences of these six virulence genes shared highest identity (ranged from 99.90 to 100%) with the corresponding virulence genes of P. multocida.  Taken together, the serotypes, sequence types and the virulence gene profiles of the 144 isolates were identical, suggesting that all the isolates were derived from the same progenitor (Fig. 1). In this study, one of the isolates named s4 was selected as the representative for the following animal experiments and whole genome sequencing.Fig. 1Neighbour-joining tree indicating the position of P. multocida isolate s4 based on the seven MLST genes. The seven MLST genes of P. multocida (adk, aroA, deoD, gdhA, g6pd, mdh and pgi), B. bronchiseptica (adk, fumC, glyA, tyrB, icd, pepA and pgm) and S. aureus (arcC, aroE, glpF, gmk, pta, tpi and yqiL) were concatenated, and then the neighbour-joining tree was constructed using MEGA 5.0 (1000 of bootstrap replications). The senve MLST genes of the strains were obtained under the accession numbers: P. multocida strains Pm70 (AE004439), HN07 (CP007040), CIRMBP-0884 (CP020345), CIRMBP-0873 (CP020347), HN06 (CP003313) and CQ2 (CP033599); B. bronchiseptica strains F709 (CP020818) and RB50 (BX470250); S. aereus strains ST59 (CP076823) and V8 (CP079715)  Animal experiments  To evaluate the virulence of P. multocida serogroup F isolate s4 in rabbits, groups of animals were subcutaneously or intranasally challenged with 6.0 × 104 colony forming units (CFU) of the s4. All the eight rabbits in the subcutaneous inoculation group survived the challenge, and all of the rabbits showed no clinical signs of disease. The only gross lesion of local subcutaneous abscess at the inoculation site was observed in the all rabbits from the subcutaneous inoculation group (Fig. 2A), and the tissue samples including tracheas, lungs, livers, hearts, spleens, kidneys and blood of the all rabbits from the subcutaneous inoculation group were negative for P. multocida. One rabbit in the intranasal inoculation group developed distinct clinical signs of cough and nasal discharge on 6 days post challenge (Fig. 2B), and the rabbit was caught up in the endpoint on 15 days post challenge because of inability to access feed and water. However, the only clinical sign of matted forepaws was showed in the remaining 7 rabbits in the intranasal inoculation group (Fig. 2C), and the seven rabbits survived the challenge. Gross lesions including hemorrhagic pneumonia (one rabbit) (Fig. 2D), pulmonary consolidation and weak hemorrhagic pneumonia (two rabbits) (Fig. 2E), and weak hemorrhagic pneumonia (five rabbits) (Fig. 2F) were observed in the rabbits in the intranasal inoculation group. The s4 was re-isolated from the following tissue samples collected from rabbits in the intranasal inoculation group: tracheas (n = 8/8), lungs (n = 8/8), livers (n = 8/8), hearts (n = 0/8), spleens (n = 0/8), kidneys (n = 0/8) and blood (n = 0/8). Histologically, inflammatory exudates appeared in the bronchiole and alveoli as well as degeneration of the alveolar epithelial cells were observed in the lung of the rabbit with hemorrhagic pneumonia (Fig. 3A), inflammatory exudates in the bronchiole and alveoli as well as proliferation of alveolar epithelial cells were shown in lungs of the two rabbits with pulmonary consolidation and weak hemorrhagic pneumonia (Fig. 3B), only proliferation of alveolar epithelial cells was shown in lungs of the five rabbits with weak hemorrhagic pneumonia (Fig. 3C). Interestingly, all the eight rabbits in the subcutaneous inoculation group and five rabbits in the intranasal inoculation group were serological positivity for P. multocida IgG on 15 days post challenge. During the 15-day experimental period, all the rabbits in the control group remained P. multocida free, and showed no clinical signs and gross lesions of disease.Fig. 2Clinical signs and gross lesions of the rabbits challenged with s4.

Interestingly, the complete genome of s4 consisted of a chromosome and a plasmid. The complete genome of the s4 has been deposited to the NCBI GenBank database under the accession numbers of CP084165 (chromosome) and CP084164 (plasmid). The chromosome of s4 was 1,781,242 bp in length with the G + C content of 40.42%, in which 1619 protein coding sequences, 45 tRNA genes, 19 rRNA genes, 3 Genomic islands (GIs) and 2 intact prophages were determined (Fig. 4A). The plasmid of s4 was 274,750 bp in length with the G + C content of 39.62%, in which 302 protein coding sequences, 7 tRNA genes, 2 GIs and one intact prophage were determined (Fig. 4B). Interestingly, BLAST analysis showed that the plasmid of s4 was highly homologous (up to 85% identity) with the other P. multocida genomes at nucleotide level (Fig. 5). By blasting against the Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Database (CARD), two elfamycin resistance genes and one cephalosporin resistance gene were predicted, and all of the three drug resistance genes were located in the chromosome of s4.Fig. 4Circular maps of the s4 genome generated by using DNAPlotter.

Therefore, the genome of s4 was compared with that of Pm70. By comparing with the genome of Pm70, gene rearrangement, gain and loss were observed in that of s4. Especially, three large regions (R) of specific sequences were found in the genome of s4 (Fig. 6). Two regions (R1 and R2) located in the chromosome and were approximately 31.9 kb and 37.0 kb in length, respectively. The third region (R3) located in the plasmid and was approximately 42.3 kb in length. Interestingly, all of the three regions located in the intact phage regions that were determined in s4 genome by using PHAST [18]. Additionally, one unique gene (LCY73_01710) encoding the TonB-dependent receptor was identified in the genome of s4 but absent in that of Pm70.Fig. 6Colinear analyses between the genomes of s4 and Pm70. s4-Chr and s4-P represent the chromosome and plasmid of s4, respectively. Rectangle of the same colour indicates the similar local colinear block of the s4 and Pm70. R1, R2 and R3 indicate the three large regions of specific sequences in the genome of s4 but not in that of Pm70  The entire cap locus of s4 were compared with those of Pm70 (capsular type F), HN07 (capsular type F), CIRMBP-0873 (capsular type F), CIRMBP-0884 (capsular type F), CQ2 (capsular type A) and HN06 (capsular type D). The result showed that the entire cap locus of s4 was highly matched with those of capsular type F strains (Pm70, HN07, CIRMBP-0873 and CIRMBP-0884), and the entire cap locus of s4 was closely matched with that of capsular type A strain (CQ2) but was distinct from that of capsular type D strain (HN06) (Fig. 7).Fig. 7Comparative analyses of the entire cap locus between the s4 and other P. multocida strains. The entire cap locus of the s4 were compared with those of Pm70 (capsular type F), HN07 (capsular type F), CIRMBP-0873 (capsular type F), CIRMBP-0884 (capsular type F), CQ2 (capsular type A) and HN06 (capsular type D). The color code represents the BLASTn identity  The LPS outer core biosynthetic genes of s4 were compared with that of Pm70. All of the LPS outer core biosynthetic genes of Pm70 were located in the chromosome, whereas these genes were located in the plasmid of s4. With the exception of natC and gatF, the LPS outer core biosynthetic genes of s4 including gatG, natB, gctC and hptE were highly matched with those of Pm70. Interestingly, an in-frame deletion of 183-bp nucleotide (in positions 559–741) was observed in the natC of s4, which resulted in a deletion of 61 amino acids (in positions 183–243) of the glycosyltransferase NatC of s4 by comparison with that of Pm70 (Fig. 8). Additionally, the gatF of s4 possessed a 210-bp nucleotide sequence redundance at the N-terminal by comparison with that of Pm70 (Fig. 8).Fig. 8Comparative analyses of the LPS outer core locus of s4. The genes required for the assembly of the LPS outer core of s4 were compared with those of CIRMBP-0873 (LPS genotype L3), CIRMBP-0884 (LPS genotype L3) and Pm70 (LPS genotype L3).

In rabbits, the infection is generally associated with the P. multocida serogroups A and D, and the knowledge about the serogroup F is limited. In the present study, a P. multocida serogroup F isolate designated s4 was recovered from the lungs of rabbits died of respiratory disease in Fujian, in the southeast of China. The pathogenicity and genomic features of the s4 were then determined.  Results  The serotype and sequence type of s4 were F:L3 and ST12, respectively. The s4 was pathogenic for rabbits, but it was a low virulent strain comparing to the previously reported highly pathogenic P. multocida serogroup F strains J-4103, C21724H3km7, P-4218 and HN07. The whole genome of the s4 was then sequenced to understand the genomic basis for pathogenicity. Particularly, a large-sized fragment of approximate 275 kb in length was truncated from the chromosome to form a plasmid. Moreover, the in-frame deletion of natC and N-terminal redundance of gatF would resulted in the production of a mutant L3 outer core structure that was distinct from those of the other P. multocida strains belonging to the lipopolysaccharide genotype L3. We deduced that these features detected in the genome of s4 might impair the pathogenicity of the bacterium.  Conclusions  This study evaluated the pathogenicity and determined the genomic features of the rabbit sourced P. multocida serogroup F isolate s4, the observations and findings would helpful for the understanding of the pathogenicity variability and genetic diversity of P. multocida.

The infection of P. multocida is often associated with economically important diseases, such as fowl cholera in poultry, haemorrhagic septicaemia in bovine, progressive atrophic rhinitis in swine, and respiratory disease in rabbit [1, 2]. P. multocida strains can be classified into five capsular serogroups or capsular genotypes (A, B, D, E and F) and further classified into sixteen lipopolysaccharide (LPS) serotypes (1–16) or eight LPS genotypes (L1-L8) [3, 4]. P. multocida strains can also be typed by using the multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) scheme based on the seven housekeeping genes [5, 6]. Rabbit pasteurellosis is generally associated with the strains of capsular serogroups A and D, LPS genotypes L3 and L6, and MLST sequence types ST10, ST11 and ST12 [7, 8]. However, some reports showed that strain of serogroup F that predominately circulated in poultry had also been detected in rabbits, and the bacterium was highly pathogenic for rabbits [9–12].  Rabbit farming is popular in Fujian, in the southeast of China [8, 13]. The number of rabbits farmed and the amount of rabbit meat yielded in Fujian were about 10.67 million and 16.2 thousand tons by the end of 2019 (Fujian Statistical Yearbook, 2020), respectively. Our previous work showed that P. multocida was widespread in rabbits in Fujian, but only strains of serogroups A and D were detected [8]. In July 2020, a respiratory infectious disease broke out on a local rabbit farm in Fujian, and around 500 rabbits died of the disease during a 30-day period. Clinical signs of cough and nasal discharge were observed in the diseased rabbits. Gross pathological lesions including hemorrhagic pneumonia and pulmonary consolidation were showed in the dead rabbits. Four PCR assays were used to screen the potential causative agents including Rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV) [14], P. multocida [3], Bordetella bronchiseptica (B. bronchiseptica) [15] and Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) [16] in the 48 lung samples collected from the dead rabbits. The results showed that the RHDV, B. bronchiseptica and S. aureus were negative, but the P. multocida was positive for the all 48 lung samples and a P. multocida serogroup F isolate named s4 was recovered from the all samples. To our knowledge, the information on the isolation and/or identification of P. multocida serogroup F strain in the rabbits in Fujian is limited, and especially, there was no report concerning the pathogenicity of rabbit sourced P. multocida serogroup F strain isolated from Fujian.  In present study, the s4 was defined by capsular typing, LPS genotyping, MLST, screened virulence factors, and evaluated the pathogenicity in rabbits. Moreover, the whole genome sequence of s4 was determined, and the whole genome comparison between the s4 and the other P. multocida serogroup F strains was performed. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the pathogenicity and determine the genetic features of the rabbit sourced P. multocida serogroup F isolate s4.  ",FALSE,TRUE,

P. multocida is one of the important pathogens results in morbidity and mortality in rabbits, whereas only the serogroups A and D had been previously recognized as the causative agents of rabbit pasteurellosis [7, 12]. It was not until 2008 that the pathogenicity of P. multocida serogroup F for rabbit was documented [12]. Since then, the presence of P. multocida serogroup F has been identified in the important rabbit farming areas worldwide [9–11]. However, the knowledge about the pathogenicity and genetic characteristics of the rabbit sourced P. multocida serogroup F is still limited. In the present study, the pathogenicity of a rabbit sourced P. multocida serogroup F isolate s4 was evaluated and the whole genome of the isolate was sequenced, which would helpful for the understanding of the pathogenitity of rabbit sourced P. multocida serogroup F.  Unexpectedly, the inoculation of s4 did not cause death and result in severe gross lesions in most of the challenged rabbits. The results were in contradict with the previous study, in which the inoculation of rabbit sourced P. multocida serogroup F isolate J-4103 caused high mortality and resulted in severe pathological lesions in most of the challenged rabbits (acute septicemic syndrome and extensive hemorrhage in subcutis in subcutaneously challenged rabbits, and fibrinopurulent pleuropneumonia and extensive hemorrhagic pneumonia in intranasally challenged rabbits) [12]. Moreover, P. multocida serogroup F isolates from chicken (C21724H3km7), turkey (P-4218) and pig (HN07) were also highly virulent to rabbit without prior adaption [23, 24]. The results suggested that the variation in virulence among P. multocida serogroup F strains, and the s4 was a low virulent strain by comparison with the J-4103, C21724H3km7, P-4218 and HN07. Additionally, it should be alert to the potential transmission of P. multocida serogroup F from chicken, turkey and pig into rabbit, which might cause high mortality and subsequent huge economic loss to rabbit farming.  P. multocida possesses a number of virulence genes, which contributes to the fitness and pathogenicity of the pathogen [1]. The s4 carried a panel of virulence genes including ptfA, tadD, hgbB, ompA, omph and oma87. The ptfA, tadD, ompA, omph and oma87 encode the proteins that are associated with P. multocida virulence because of their roles in the attachment and colonization of host [25, 26]. The hgbB encodes an outer membrane protein, which is involved in iron acquisition [25]. Interestingly, the P. multocida serogroup D isolates carrying the hgbB were significantly associated with the clinical presentation of respiratory disease in rabbits [9]. Additionally, comparative genomic analyses between s4 and Pm70 identified a unique gene in s4 but absent in Pm70. The unique gene (LCY73_01710) encoded TonB-dependent receptor that is essential for transport of organic iron chelators (siderophores) into the periplasm to establish commensal and pathogenic relationships with the hosts [27]. In Pm70, more than 2.5% of the genome was devoted to genes encoding proteins involved in iron uptake and acquisition, suggesting that iron uptake and acquisition is important for P. multocida survival and pathogenesis [17]. Taken together, the presence of these genes might contribute to the pathogenicity of the s4.  The complete genome of s4 was sequenced and then the comparative genomic analyses were performed to better understand the genetic basis for the pathogenicity of s4. The genome of s4 shared a high level of DNA identity to that of Pm70. However, the genome of s4 was smaller (approximate 200 kb) than that of Pm70, which might result in the loss of a number of functional genes and subsequently impaired the pathogenicity of the s4. Interestingly, the s4 possessed a plasmid of approximate 275 kb in length, and the sequence of the plasmid shared a high level of DNA identity (up to 90% identity) to the plasmid (approximate 325 kb in length) of rabbit sourced P. multocida serogroup F strain CIRMBP-0884. Additionally, the plasmids of the rabbit sourced P. multocida serogroup F strains s4 and CIRMBP-0884 were highly identical (up to 85% indentity) to the other P. multocida genomes at nucleotide level. Therefore, it was deduced that the sequences of the plasmids of s4 and CIRMBP-0884 might derive from their own genomes. Interestingly, only a small number of P. multocida strains possess plasmids according to the P. multocida genomes deposited in the NCBI genome database. The plasmids of P. multocida strains often carry antibiotic resistance genes and mobilization genes [28], and plasmids of some P. multocida strains carry the toxA gene encoding the dermonecrotic toxin [28]. Unexpectedly, the antibiotic resistance genes, mobilization genes and toxin gene were not determined in the plasmid of s4.  LPS is an important virulence determinant of P. multocida [29]. The LPS of the s4 belongs to the genotype of L3. It was showed that P. multocida strains belonging to the LPS genotype L3 might be highly virulent because these strains were the most common causative agents of fowl cholera [4, 29]. The L3 outer core structure is similar to the self-antigen of host, which facilitates the bacteria evading the host innate immune system [29]. The in-frame deletion of natC and the N-terminal redundance of gatF would result in the production of a mutant L3 outer core structure, which might contribute to the low pathogenicity of s4. Interestingly, the genetic diversities of natC and gatF from P. multocida serogroup F:L3 strains of CIRMBP-0873, CIRMBP-0884 and HN07 were also detected (Fig. 8) [30]. Taken together, the effects of the polymorphism in the LPS outer core genes natC and gatF on the pathogenicity of P. multocida would be worth eliciting in the further work.

The genes required for the assembly of the LPS outer core of s4 were compared with those of CIRMBP-0873 (LPS genotype L3), CIRMBP-0884 (LPS genotype L3) and Pm70 (LPS genotype L3).

For the detection of RHDV, the suspension was centrifuged at 1500×g for 15 min at 4 °C, and two hundred microliter of the supernatant was collected and used for viral RNA extraction using the EasyPure Viral DNA/RNA kit (TransGen Biotech, Beijing, China). The extracted viral RNA was reverse-transcribed to complementary DNA (cDNA) using the EasyScript Reverse Transciptase (TransGen Biotech, Beijing, China) by using the Oligo-dT18 as the primer. The synthetic cDNA was used as the genomic template to screen the presence of the RHDV in the lung samples by using the PCR assay described by Schwensow et al. [14]. For the detection of P. multocida, B. bronchiseptica and S. aureus, one hundred microliter of lung suspension was centrifuged at 5000×g for 10 min at room temperature, and the pellet was used for bacterial DNA extraction using the EasyPure Bacteria Genomic DNA kit (TransGen Biotech, Beijing, China). The extracted DNA was used as the genomic template to screen the presence of the P. multocida, B. bronchiseptica and S. aureus in the lung samples by using the PCR assays described by Townsend et al. [3], Wang et al. [15] and Brakstad et al. [16], respectively.  P. multocida isolation and identification  One hundred microliter of the lung suspension was spread on the BHI agar plate containing 5% defibrinated sheep blood and incubated at 37 °C for 24 to 48 h. Three isolates from each plate were randomly picked up and each isolate was inoculated in 5 mL of BHI containing 2% bovine serum. Then, the isolates were shaken at the conditions of 180 rpm and 37 °C for 24 h. To confirm the identities of the isolates, the 16S rRNA genes of the isolates were amplified and sequenced [31], and the capsular types and LPS genotypes of the isolates were defined using the PCR assays described by Townsend et al. [3] and Harper et al. [4], respectively.  MLST  The MLST analyses of the isolates were conducted using the Multi-host MLST scheme described in the PubMLST (https://pubmlst.org/pmultocida/). The genomic DNA of the isolates were prepared using the EasyPure Bacteria Genomic DNA kit (TransGen Biotech, Beijing, China), and the seven housekeeping genes including adk, aroA, deoD, gdhA, g6pd, mdh and pgi of each isolate were amplified from the genomic DNA of the isolates. The expected PCR products were purified and subjected to sequence. The allelic profile of each isolate was defined by comparing the sequences of the 7 housekeeping genes of each isolate to the corresponding known sequences in the PubMLST database. The sequence type of each isolate was then defined by submitting the allelic profile to the PubMLST database.  Virulence genes detection  The genomic DNA of the isolates were prepared using the EasyPure Bacteria Genomic DNA kit (TransGen Biotech, Beijing, China) and were screened for the presence of twelve virulence genes including adhesion related proteins (ptfA, tadD and pfhA), dermonecrotoxin (toxA), iron binding proteins (fur, tbpA and hgbB), sialidases (nanB), hyaluronidase (pmHAS) and outer membrane proteins (ompA, ompH and oma87). Primers used for ptfA, tadD, pfhA, toxA, fur, nanB, pmHAS, ompA, ompH and oma87 were described by Tang et al. [26]. Primers used for tbpA and hgbB were described by Ewers et al. [25]. The expected PCR products were purified and sequenced, and the identities of these products were confirmed by comparing the sequences against the NCBI GenBank database.  Animal experiments  Twenty-four 30-day-old rabbits obtained from a local rabbit farm were randomly divided into three groups (subcutaneous inoculation group, intranasal inoculation group and negative control group) of eight rabbits each (four males and four females). Each group was placed in a separate room, and two rabbits (one male and one female) from the same group were kept in a cage. Before infection, nasal, conjunctival and rectal swabs as well as whole blood were collected for bacteriological detection to ensure P. multocida-free status of the rabbits [12]. The sera of the rabbits were also tested for the presence of P. multocida IgG as described by Jaglic et al. [12].  Rabbits in groups of subcutaneous inoculation group and intranasal inoculation group were subcutaneously and intranasally inoculated with 6.0 × 104 CFU of the isolate suspended in 100 μL of sterile normal saline, respectively. Rabbits in the negative control group were intranasally inoculated with 100 μL of sterile normal saline. The challenge does and routs were selected as described by Jaglic et al. [12, 23]. The clinical signs including cough, nasal discharge and dyspnea were monitored twice daily for 15 days for the all rabbits. At the end of the experiment, the gross lesions of the all rabbits were examined and tissue samples including tracheas, lungs, livers, hearts, spleens, kidneys and whole blood of all rabbits were collected for bacteriological examination, and the sera was used for serological examination as described by Jaglic et al. [12]. Lung samples from the rabbits of intranasal inoculation group were histologically examined using hematoxylin-eosin staining.  Prior to challenge, all the rabbits were anaesthetized with intravenous injection of ketamine (40 mg/kg). Rabbits that were caught up in the endpoint (dyspnoea, weight loss of 15% or inability to access feed or water), and rabbits that survived until the 15 days were also sacrificed under ketamine narcosis to minimize sufferings.  Genome sequencing and comparative analysis  The whole genome of the isolate was sequenced using PacBio system (Pacific Biosciences, USA) at Shanghai Majorbio Bio-Pharm Technology Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). The PacBio system generated 244,686 total reads and 1,833,208,095 total bases, with the average reads length of 7492.08 bases and the average genome coverage of 891-fold. The raw reads were analyzed on the Majorbio Cloud Platform (www.majorbio.com), and then the complete genome of the isolate was de novo assembled. The complete genome of the isolate was annotated using the NCBI Prokaryotic Genome Annotation Pipeline. Genomic island and prophage were determined using IslandViewer 4 [32] and PHAST [18], respectively. Drug resistance genes were determined by comparing the sequence of the isolate against the comprehensive antibiotic resistance database (CARD) (https://card.mcmaster.ca/). The circular genome map of the isolate was plotted using DNAPlotter (version 17.0.1) [33]. The complete genomes of the P. multocida strains CQ2 (capsular serogroup A), HN06 (capsular serogroup D), Pm70 (capsular serogroup F), HN07 (capsular serogroup F), CIRMBP-0873 (capsular serogroup F) and CIRMBP-0884 (capsular serogroup F) were freely obtained from NCBI database under the accession numbers of CP033599, CP003313, AE004439, CP007040, CP020347 and CP020345, respectively. The whole genome comparison between the isolate and these strains was performed by using progressiveMauve alignment procedure on Mauve (version 2.4.0) [34], BLAST (version 2.4.0) [35], BRIG (version 0.95-dist) [36] and Easyfig (version 2.2.5) [37].

The results showed that RHDV, B. bronchiseptica and S. aureus were negative for the all 48 lung samples, whereas P. multocida was positive for the all 48 lung samples. All the lung samples were then subjected to P. multocida isolation.  All the 48 lung samples produced identical bacterial colonies on brain heart infusion (BHI) blood agar plate. The colonies were grey, round, smooth and less than 1 mm in diameter. Three colonies from each lung sample were randomly picked up. The sequences of the 16S rRNA genes of the 144 isolates recovered from the 48 lung samples were identical and shared the highest identity (range from 99.90 to 100%) with that of P. multocida. The PCR assays for capsular and LPS typing of the isolates yielded segments of approximate 850 bp and 470 bp in length, and the sequences of the two segments were 100% identical with the fcbD and gatF of P. multocida, respectively. The results indicated that the 144 isolates were P. multocida serotype F:L3.  MLST  The allelic numbers of the 7 housekeeping genes (adk, aroA, deoD, gdhA, g6pd, mdh and pgi) of the 144 isolates were identical and assigned as 8–8–5-3-5-7-5, and the sequence types of the 144 isolates were then defined as ST12.  Virulence genes detection  The virulence genes ptfA, tadD, hgbB, ompA, omph and oma87 were positive for the 144 isolates, whereas the virulence genes pfhA, toxA, fur, tbpA, nanB and pmHAS were negative for the all isolates. The sequence of each of the virulence genes (ptfA, tadD, hgbB, ompA, omph and oma87) of the 144 isolates were identical, and the sequences of these six virulence genes shared highest identity (ranged from 99.90 to 100%) with the corresponding virulence genes of P. multocida.  Taken together, the serotypes, sequence types and the virulence gene profiles of the 144 isolates were identical, suggesting that all the isolates were derived from the same progenitor (Fig. 1). In this study, one of the isolates named s4 was selected as the representative for the following animal experiments and whole genome sequencing.Fig. 1Neighbour-joining tree indicating the position of P. multocida isolate s4 based on the seven MLST genes. The seven MLST genes of P. multocida (adk, aroA, deoD, gdhA, g6pd, mdh and pgi), B. bronchiseptica (adk, fumC, glyA, tyrB, icd, pepA and pgm) and S. aureus (arcC, aroE, glpF, gmk, pta, tpi and yqiL) were concatenated, and then the neighbour-joining tree was constructed using MEGA 5.0 (1000 of bootstrap replications). The senve MLST genes of the strains were obtained under the accession numbers: P. multocida strains Pm70 (AE004439), HN07 (CP007040), CIRMBP-0884 (CP020345), CIRMBP-0873 (CP020347), HN06 (CP003313) and CQ2 (CP033599); B. bronchiseptica strains F709 (CP020818) and RB50 (BX470250); S. aereus strains ST59 (CP076823) and V8 (CP079715)  Animal experiments  To evaluate the virulence of P. multocida serogroup F isolate s4 in rabbits, groups of animals were subcutaneously or intranasally challenged with 6.0 × 104 colony forming units (CFU) of the s4. All the eight rabbits in the subcutaneous inoculation group survived the challenge, and all of the rabbits showed no clinical signs of disease. The only gross lesion of local subcutaneous abscess at the inoculation site was observed in the all rabbits from the subcutaneous inoculation group (Fig. 2A), and the tissue samples including tracheas, lungs, livers, hearts, spleens, kidneys and blood of the all rabbits from the subcutaneous inoculation group were negative for P. multocida. One rabbit in the intranasal inoculation group developed distinct clinical signs of cough and nasal discharge on 6 days post challenge (Fig. 2B), and the rabbit was caught up in the endpoint on 15 days post challenge because of inability to access feed and water. However, the only clinical sign of matted forepaws was showed in the remaining 7 rabbits in the intranasal inoculation group (Fig. 2C), and the seven rabbits survived the challenge. Gross lesions including hemorrhagic pneumonia (one rabbit) (Fig. 2D), pulmonary consolidation and weak hemorrhagic pneumonia (two rabbits) (Fig. 2E), and weak hemorrhagic pneumonia (five rabbits) (Fig. 2F) were observed in the rabbits in the intranasal inoculation group. The s4 was re-isolated from the following tissue samples collected from rabbits in the intranasal inoculation group: tracheas (n = 8/8), lungs (n = 8/8), livers (n = 8/8), hearts (n = 0/8), spleens (n = 0/8), kidneys (n = 0/8) and blood (n = 0/8). Histologically, inflammatory exudates appeared in the bronchiole and alveoli as well as degeneration of the alveolar epithelial cells were observed in the lung of the rabbit with hemorrhagic pneumonia (Fig. 3A), inflammatory exudates in the bronchiole and alveoli as well as proliferation of alveolar epithelial cells were shown in lungs of the two rabbits with pulmonary consolidation and weak hemorrhagic pneumonia (Fig. 3B), only proliferation of alveolar epithelial cells was shown in lungs of the five rabbits with weak hemorrhagic pneumonia (Fig. 3C). Interestingly, all the eight rabbits in the subcutaneous inoculation group and five rabbits in the intranasal inoculation group were serological positivity for P. multocida IgG on 15 days post challenge. During the 15-day experimental period, all the rabbits in the control group remained P. multocida free, and showed no clinical signs and gross lesions of disease.Fig. 2Clinical signs and gross lesions of the rabbits challenged with s4.

Interestingly, the complete genome of s4 consisted of a chromosome and a plasmid. The complete genome of the s4 has been deposited to the NCBI GenBank database under the accession numbers of CP084165 (chromosome) and CP084164 (plasmid). The chromosome of s4 was 1,781,242 bp in length with the G + C content of 40.42%, in which 1619 protein coding sequences, 45 tRNA genes, 19 rRNA genes, 3 Genomic islands (GIs) and 2 intact prophages were determined (Fig. 4A). The plasmid of s4 was 274,750 bp in length with the G + C content of 39.62%, in which 302 protein coding sequences, 7 tRNA genes, 2 GIs and one intact prophage were determined (Fig. 4B). Interestingly, BLAST analysis showed that the plasmid of s4 was highly homologous (up to 85% identity) with the other P. multocida genomes at nucleotide level (Fig. 5). By blasting against the Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Database (CARD), two elfamycin resistance genes and one cephalosporin resistance gene were predicted, and all of the three drug resistance genes were located in the chromosome of s4.Fig. 4Circular maps of the s4 genome generated by using DNAPlotter.

Therefore, the genome of s4 was compared with that of Pm70. By comparing with the genome of Pm70, gene rearrangement, gain and loss were observed in that of s4. Especially, three large regions (R) of specific sequences were found in the genome of s4 (Fig. 6). Two regions (R1 and R2) located in the chromosome and were approximately 31.9 kb and 37.0 kb in length, respectively. The third region (R3) located in the plasmid and was approximately 42.3 kb in length. Interestingly, all of the three regions located in the intact phage regions that were determined in s4 genome by using PHAST [18]. Additionally, one unique gene (LCY73_01710) encoding the TonB-dependent receptor was identified in the genome of s4 but absent in that of Pm70.Fig. 6Colinear analyses between the genomes of s4 and Pm70. s4-Chr and s4-P represent the chromosome and plasmid of s4, respectively.

The result showed that the entire cap locus of s4 was highly matched with those of capsular type F strains (Pm70, HN07, CIRMBP-0873 and CIRMBP-0884), and the entire cap locus of s4 was closely matched with that of capsular type A strain (CQ2) but was distinct from that of capsular type D strain (HN06) (Fig. 7).Fig. 7Comparative analyses of the entire cap locus between the s4 and other P. multocida strains. The entire cap locus of the s4 were compared with those of Pm70 (capsular type F), HN07 (capsular type F), CIRMBP-0873 (capsular type F), CIRMBP-0884 (capsular type F), CQ2 (capsular type A) and HN06 (capsular type D). The color code represents the BLASTn identity  The LPS outer core biosynthetic genes of s4 were compared with that of Pm70. All of the LPS outer core biosynthetic genes of Pm70 were located in the chromosome, whereas these genes were located in the plasmid of s4. With the exception of natC and gatF, the LPS outer core biosynthetic genes of s4 including gatG, natB, gctC and hptE were highly matched with those of Pm70. Interestingly, an in-frame deletion of 183-bp nucleotide (in positions 559–741) was observed in the natC of s4, which resulted in a deletion of 61 amino acids (in positions 183–243) of the glycosyltransferase NatC of s4 by comparison with that of Pm70 (Fig. 8). Additionally, the gatF of s4 possessed a 210-bp nucleotide sequence redundance at the N-terminal by comparison with that of Pm70 (Fig. 8).Fig. 8Comparative analyses of the LPS outer core locus of s4. The genes required for the assembly of the LPS outer core of s4 were compared with those of CIRMBP-0873 (LPS genotype L3), CIRMBP-0884 (LPS genotype L3) and Pm70 (LPS genotype L3).

In rabbits, the infection is generally associated with the P. multocida serogroups A and D, and the knowledge about the serogroup F is limited. In the present study, a P. multocida serogroup F isolate designated s4 was recovered from the lungs of rabbits died of respiratory disease in Fujian, in the southeast of China. The pathogenicity and genomic features of the s4 were then determined.  Results  The serotype and sequence type of s4 were F:L3 and ST12, respectively. The s4 was pathogenic for rabbits, but it was a low virulent strain comparing to the previously reported highly pathogenic P. multocida serogroup F strains J-4103, C21724H3km7, P-4218 and HN07. The whole genome of the s4 was then sequenced to understand the genomic basis for pathogenicity. Particularly, a large-sized fragment of approximate 275 kb in length was truncated from the chromosome to form a plasmid. Moreover, the in-frame deletion of natC and N-terminal redundance of gatF would resulted in the production of a mutant L3 outer core structure that was distinct from those of the other P. multocida strains belonging to the lipopolysaccharide genotype L3. We deduced that these features detected in the genome of s4 might impair the pathogenicity of the bacterium.

The infection of P. multocida is often associated with economically important diseases, such as fowl cholera in poultry, haemorrhagic septicaemia in bovine, progressive atrophic rhinitis in swine, and respiratory disease in rabbit [1, 2]. P. multocida strains can be classified into five capsular serogroups or capsular genotypes (A, B, D, E and F) and further classified into sixteen lipopolysaccharide (LPS) serotypes (1–16) or eight LPS genotypes (L1-L8) [3, 4]. P. multocida strains can also be typed by using the multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) scheme based on the seven housekeeping genes [5, 6]. Rabbit pasteurellosis is generally associated with the strains of capsular serogroups A and D, LPS genotypes L3 and L6, and MLST sequence types ST10, ST11 and ST12 [7, 8]. However, some reports showed that strain of serogroup F that predominately circulated in poultry had also been detected in rabbits, and the bacterium was highly pathogenic for rabbits [9–12].  Rabbit farming is popular in Fujian, in the southeast of China [8, 13]. The number of rabbits farmed and the amount of rabbit meat yielded in Fujian were about 10.67 million and 16.2 thousand tons by the end of 2019 (Fujian Statistical Yearbook, 2020), respectively. Our previous work showed that P. multocida was widespread in rabbits in Fujian, but only strains of serogroups A and D were detected [8]. In July 2020, a respiratory infectious disease broke out on a local rabbit farm in Fujian, and around 500 rabbits died of the disease during a 30-day period. Clinical signs of cough and nasal discharge were observed in the diseased rabbits. Gross pathological lesions including hemorrhagic pneumonia and pulmonary consolidation were showed in the dead rabbits. Four PCR assays were used to screen the potential causative agents including Rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV) [14], P. multocida [3], Bordetella bronchiseptica (B. bronchiseptica) [15] and Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) [16] in the 48 lung samples collected from the dead rabbits. The results showed that the RHDV, B. bronchiseptica and S. aureus were negative, but the P. multocida was positive for the all 48 lung samples and a P. multocida serogroup F isolate named s4 was recovered from the all samples. To our knowledge, the information on the isolation and/or identification of P. multocida serogroup F strain in the rabbits in Fujian is limited, and especially, there was no report concerning the pathogenicity of rabbit sourced P. multocida serogroup F strain isolated from Fujian.  In present study, the s4 was defined by capsular typing, LPS genotyping, MLST, screened virulence factors, and evaluated the pathogenicity in rabbits. Moreover, the whole genome sequence of s4 was determined, and the whole genome comparison between the s4 and the other P. multocida serogroup F strains was performed. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the pathogenicity and determine the genetic features of the rabbit sourced P. multocida serogroup F isolate s4.  ",FALSE,TRUE,

P. multocida is one of the important pathogens results in morbidity and mortality in rabbits, whereas only the serogroups A and D had been previously recognized as the causative agents of rabbit pasteurellosis [7, 12]. It was not until 2008 that the pathogenicity of P. multocida serogroup F for rabbit was documented [12]. Since then, the presence of P. multocida serogroup F has been identified in the important rabbit farming areas worldwide [9–11]. However, the knowledge about the pathogenicity and genetic characteristics of the rabbit sourced P. multocida serogroup F is still limited. In the present study, the pathogenicity of a rabbit sourced P. multocida serogroup F isolate s4 was evaluated and the whole genome of the isolate was sequenced, which would helpful for the understanding of the pathogenitity of rabbit sourced P. multocida serogroup F.  Unexpectedly, the inoculation of s4 did not cause death and result in severe gross lesions in most of the challenged rabbits. The results were in contradict with the previous study, in which the inoculation of rabbit sourced P. multocida serogroup F isolate J-4103 caused high mortality and resulted in severe pathological lesions in most of the challenged rabbits (acute septicemic syndrome and extensive hemorrhage in subcutis in subcutaneously challenged rabbits, and fibrinopurulent pleuropneumonia and extensive hemorrhagic pneumonia in intranasally challenged rabbits) [12]. Moreover, P. multocida serogroup F isolates from chicken (C21724H3km7), turkey (P-4218) and pig (HN07) were also highly virulent to rabbit without prior adaption [23, 24]. The results suggested that the variation in virulence among P. multocida serogroup F strains, and the s4 was a low virulent strain by comparison with the J-4103, C21724H3km7, P-4218 and HN07. Additionally, it should be alert to the potential transmission of P. multocida serogroup F from chicken, turkey and pig into rabbit, which might cause high mortality and subsequent huge economic loss to rabbit farming.  P. multocida possesses a number of virulence genes, which contributes to the fitness and pathogenicity of the pathogen [1]. The s4 carried a panel of virulence genes including ptfA, tadD, hgbB, ompA, omph and oma87. The ptfA, tadD, ompA, omph and oma87 encode the proteins that are associated with P. multocida virulence because of their roles in the attachment and colonization of host [25, 26]. The hgbB encodes an outer membrane protein, which is involved in iron acquisition [25]. Interestingly, the P. multocida serogroup D isolates carrying the hgbB were significantly associated with the clinical presentation of respiratory disease in rabbits [9]. Additionally, comparative genomic analyses between s4 and Pm70 identified a unique gene in s4 but absent in Pm70. The unique gene (LCY73_01710) encoded TonB-dependent receptor that is essential for transport of organic iron chelators (siderophores) into the periplasm to establish commensal and pathogenic relationships with the hosts [27]. In Pm70, more than 2.5% of the genome was devoted to genes encoding proteins involved in iron uptake and acquisition, suggesting that iron uptake and acquisition is important for P. multocida survival and pathogenesis [17]. Taken together, the presence of these genes might contribute to the pathogenicity of the s4.  The complete genome of s4 was sequenced and then the comparative genomic analyses were performed to better understand the genetic basis for the pathogenicity of s4. The genome of s4 shared a high level of DNA identity to that of Pm70. However, the genome of s4 was smaller (approximate 200 kb) than that of Pm70, which might result in the loss of a number of functional genes and subsequently impaired the pathogenicity of the s4. Interestingly, the s4 possessed a plasmid of approximate 275 kb in length, and the sequence of the plasmid shared a high level of DNA identity (up to 90% identity) to the plasmid (approximate 325 kb in length) of rabbit sourced P. multocida serogroup F strain CIRMBP-0884. Additionally, the plasmids of the rabbit sourced P. multocida serogroup F strains s4 and CIRMBP-0884 were highly identical (up to 85% indentity) to the other P. multocida genomes at nucleotide level. Therefore, it was deduced that the sequences of the plasmids of s4 and CIRMBP-0884 might derive from their own genomes. Interestingly, only a small number of P. multocida strains possess plasmids according to the P. multocida genomes deposited in the NCBI genome database. The plasmids of P. multocida strains often carry antibiotic resistance genes and mobilization genes [28], and plasmids of some P. multocida strains carry the toxA gene encoding the dermonecrotic toxin [28]. Unexpectedly, the antibiotic resistance genes, mobilization genes and toxin gene were not determined in the plasmid of s4.  LPS is an important virulence determinant of P. multocida [29]. The LPS of the s4 belongs to the genotype of L3. It was showed that P. multocida strains belonging to the LPS genotype L3 might be highly virulent because these strains were the most common causative agents of fowl cholera [4, 29]. The L3 outer core structure is similar to the self-antigen of host, which facilitates the bacteria evading the host innate immune system [29]. The in-frame deletion of natC and the N-terminal redundance of gatF would result in the production of a mutant L3 outer core structure, which might contribute to the low pathogenicity of s4. Interestingly, the genetic diversities of natC and gatF from P. multocida serogroup F:L3 strains of CIRMBP-0873, CIRMBP-0884 and HN07 were also detected (Fig. 8) [30]. Taken together, the effects of the polymorphism in the LPS outer core genes natC and gatF on the pathogenicity of P. multocida would be worth eliciting in the further work.

The genes required for the assembly of the LPS outer core of s4 were compared with those of CIRMBP-0873 (LPS genotype L3), CIRMBP-0884 (LPS genotype L3) and Pm70 (LPS genotype L3).

""The expected PCR products were purified and sequenced, and the identities of these products were confirmed by comparing the sequences against the NCBI GenBank database.""","  Methods  Sample collection and detection of potential pathogen  A total of 48 lung samples were collected from the naturally infected dead rabbits. Each lung sample was placed in a sterile tube, kept on ice and delivered to our lab for examination within 24 h. Each lung sample was homogenized to make a 50% suspension in sterile normal saline. For the detection of RHDV, the suspension was centrifuged at 1500×g for 15 min at 4 °C, and two hundred microliter of the supernatant was collected and used for viral RNA extraction using the EasyPure Viral DNA/RNA kit (TransGen Biotech, Beijing, China). The extracted viral RNA was reverse-transcribed to complementary DNA (cDNA) using the EasyScript Reverse Transciptase (TransGen Biotech, Beijing, China) by using the Oligo-dT18 as the primer. The synthetic cDNA was used as the genomic template to screen the presence of the RHDV in the lung samples by using the PCR assay described by Schwensow et al. [14]. For the detection of P. multocida, B. bronchiseptica and S. aureus, one hundred microliter of lung suspension was centrifuged at 5000×g for 10 min at room temperature, and the pellet was used for bacterial DNA extraction using the EasyPure Bacteria Genomic DNA kit (TransGen Biotech, Beijing, China). The extracted DNA was used as the genomic template to screen the presence of the P. multocida, B. bronchiseptica and S. aureus in the lung samples by using the PCR assays described by Townsend et al. [3], Wang et al. [15] and Brakstad et al. [16], respectively.  P. multocida isolation and identification  One hundred microliter of the lung suspension was spread on the BHI agar plate containing 5% defibrinated sheep blood and incubated at 37 °C for 24 to 48 h. Three isolates from each plate were randomly picked up and each isolate was inoculated in 5 mL of BHI containing 2% bovine serum. Then, the isolates were shaken at the conditions of 180 rpm and 37 °C for 24 h. To confirm the identities of the isolates, the 16S rRNA genes of the isolates were amplified and sequenced [31], and the capsular types and LPS genotypes of the isolates were defined using the PCR assays described by Townsend et al. [3] and Harper et al. [4], respectively.  MLST  The MLST analyses of the isolates were conducted using the Multi-host MLST scheme described in the PubMLST (https://pubmlst.org/pmultocida/). The genomic DNA of the isolates were prepared using the EasyPure Bacteria Genomic DNA kit (TransGen Biotech, Beijing, China), and the seven housekeeping genes including adk, aroA, deoD, gdhA, g6pd, mdh and pgi of each isolate were amplified from the genomic DNA of the isolates. The expected PCR products were purified and subjected to sequence. The allelic profile of each isolate was defined by comparing the sequences of the 7 housekeeping genes of each isolate to the corresponding known sequences in the PubMLST database. The sequence type of each isolate was then defined by submitting the allelic profile to the PubMLST database.  Virulence genes detection  The genomic DNA of the isolates were prepared using the EasyPure Bacteria Genomic DNA kit (TransGen Biotech, Beijing, China) and were screened for the presence of twelve virulence genes including adhesion related proteins (ptfA, tadD and pfhA), dermonecrotoxin (toxA), iron binding proteins (fur, tbpA and hgbB), sialidases (nanB), hyaluronidase (pmHAS) and outer membrane proteins (ompA, ompH and oma87). Primers used for ptfA, tadD, pfhA, toxA, fur, nanB, pmHAS, ompA, ompH and oma87 were described by Tang et al. [26]. Primers used for tbpA and hgbB were described by Ewers et al. [25]. The expected PCR products were purified and sequenced, and the identities of these products were confirmed by comparing the sequences against the NCBI GenBank database.  Animal experiments  Twenty-four 30-day-old rabbits obtained from a local rabbit farm were randomly divided into three groups (subcutaneous inoculation group, intranasal inoculation group and negative control group) of eight rabbits each (four males and four females). Each group was placed in a separate room, and two rabbits (one male and one female) from the same group were kept in a cage. Before infection, nasal, conjunctival and rectal swabs as well as whole blood were collected for bacteriological detection to ensure P. multocida-free status of the rabbits [12]. The sera of the rabbits were also tested for the presence of P. multocida IgG as described by Jaglic et al. [12].  Rabbits in groups of subcutaneous inoculation group and intranasal inoculation group were subcutaneously and intranasally inoculated with 6.0 × 104 CFU of the isolate suspended in 100 μL of sterile normal saline, respectively. Rabbits in the negative control group were intranasally inoculated with 100 μL of sterile normal saline. The challenge does and routs were selected as described by Jaglic et al. [12, 23]. The clinical signs including cough, nasal discharge and dyspnea were monitored twice daily for 15 days for the all rabbits. At the end of the experiment, the gross lesions of the all rabbits were examined and tissue samples including tracheas, lungs, livers, hearts, spleens, kidneys and whole blood of all rabbits were collected for bacteriological examination, and the sera was used for serological examination as described by Jaglic et al. [12]. Lung samples from the rabbits of intranasal inoculation group were histologically examined using hematoxylin-eosin staining.  Prior to challenge, all the rabbits were anaesthetized with intravenous injection of ketamine (40 mg/kg). Rabbits that were caught up in the endpoint (dyspnoea, weight loss of 15% or inability to access feed or water), and rabbits that survived until the 15 days were also sacrificed under ketamine narcosis to minimize sufferings.  Genome sequencing and comparative analysis  The whole genome of the isolate was sequenced using PacBio system (Pacific Biosciences, USA) at Shanghai Majorbio Bio-Pharm Technology Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). The PacBio system generated 244,686 total reads and 1,833,208,095 total bases, with the average reads length of 7492.08 bases and the average genome coverage of 891-fold. The raw reads were analyzed on the Majorbio Cloud Platform (www.majorbio.com), and then the complete genome of the isolate was de novo assembled. The complete genome of the isolate was annotated using the NCBI Prokaryotic Genome Annotation Pipeline. Genomic island and prophage were determined using IslandViewer 4 [32] and PHAST [18], respectively. Drug resistance genes were determined by comparing the sequence of the isolate against the comprehensive antibiotic resistance database (CARD) (https://card.mcmaster.ca/). The circular genome map of the isolate was plotted using DNAPlotter (version 17.0.1) [33]. The complete genomes of the P. multocida strains CQ2 (capsular serogroup A), HN06 (capsular serogroup D), Pm70 (capsular serogroup F), HN07 (capsular serogroup F), CIRMBP-0873 (capsular serogroup F) and CIRMBP-0884 (capsular serogroup F) were freely obtained from NCBI database under the accession numbers of CP033599, CP003313, AE004439, CP007040, CP020347 and CP020345, respectively. The whole genome comparison between the isolate and these strains was performed by using progressiveMauve alignment procedure on Mauve (version 2.4.0) [34], BLAST (version 2.4.0) [35], BRIG (version 0.95-dist) [36] and Easyfig (version 2.2.5) [37].

The results showed that RHDV, B. bronchiseptica and S. aureus were negative for the all 48 lung samples, whereas P. multocida was positive for the all 48 lung samples. All the lung samples were then subjected to P. multocida isolation.  All the 48 lung samples produced identical bacterial colonies on brain heart infusion (BHI) blood agar plate. The colonies were grey, round, smooth and less than 1 mm in diameter. Three colonies from each lung sample were randomly picked up. The sequences of the 16S rRNA genes of the 144 isolates recovered from the 48 lung samples were identical and shared the highest identity (range from 99.90 to 100%) with that of P. multocida. The PCR assays for capsular and LPS typing of the isolates yielded segments of approximate 850 bp and 470 bp in length, and the sequences of the two segments were 100% identical with the fcbD and gatF of P. multocida, respectively. The results indicated that the 144 isolates were P. multocida serotype F:L3.  MLST  The allelic numbers of the 7 housekeeping genes (adk, aroA, deoD, gdhA, g6pd, mdh and pgi) of the 144 isolates were identical and assigned as 8–8–5-3-5-7-5, and the sequence types of the 144 isolates were then defined as ST12.  Virulence genes detection  The virulence genes ptfA, tadD, hgbB, ompA, omph and oma87 were positive for the 144 isolates, whereas the virulence genes pfhA, toxA, fur, tbpA, nanB and pmHAS were negative for the all isolates. The sequence of each of the virulence genes (ptfA, tadD, hgbB, ompA, omph and oma87) of the 144 isolates were identical, and the sequences of these six virulence genes shared highest identity (ranged from 99.90 to 100%) with the corresponding virulence genes of P. multocida.  Taken together, the serotypes, sequence types and the virulence gene profiles of the 144 isolates were identical, suggesting that all the isolates were derived from the same progenitor (Fig. 1). In this study, one of the isolates named s4 was selected as the representative for the following animal experiments and whole genome sequencing.Fig. 1Neighbour-joining tree indicating the position of P. multocida isolate s4 based on the seven MLST genes. The seven MLST genes of P. multocida (adk, aroA, deoD, gdhA, g6pd, mdh and pgi), B. bronchiseptica (adk, fumC, glyA, tyrB, icd, pepA and pgm) and S. aureus (arcC, aroE, glpF, gmk, pta, tpi and yqiL) were concatenated, and then the neighbour-joining tree was constructed using MEGA 5.0 (1000 of bootstrap replications). The senve MLST genes of the strains were obtained under the accession numbers: P. multocida strains Pm70 (AE004439), HN07 (CP007040), CIRMBP-0884 (CP020345), CIRMBP-0873 (CP020347), HN06 (CP003313) and CQ2 (CP033599); B. bronchiseptica strains F709 (CP020818) and RB50 (BX470250); S. aereus strains ST59 (CP076823) and V8 (CP079715)  Animal experiments  To evaluate the virulence of P. multocida serogroup F isolate s4 in rabbits, groups of animals were subcutaneously or intranasally challenged with 6.0 × 104 colony forming units (CFU) of the s4. All the eight rabbits in the subcutaneous inoculation group survived the challenge, and all of the rabbits showed no clinical signs of disease. The only gross lesion of local subcutaneous abscess at the inoculation site was observed in the all rabbits from the subcutaneous inoculation group (Fig. 2A), and the tissue samples including tracheas, lungs, livers, hearts, spleens, kidneys and blood of the all rabbits from the subcutaneous inoculation group were negative for P. multocida. One rabbit in the intranasal inoculation group developed distinct clinical signs of cough and nasal discharge on 6 days post challenge (Fig. 2B), and the rabbit was caught up in the endpoint on 15 days post challenge because of inability to access feed and water. However, the only clinical sign of matted forepaws was showed in the remaining 7 rabbits in the intranasal inoculation group (Fig. 2C), and the seven rabbits survived the challenge. Gross lesions including hemorrhagic pneumonia (one rabbit) (Fig. 2D), pulmonary consolidation and weak hemorrhagic pneumonia (two rabbits) (Fig. 2E), and weak hemorrhagic pneumonia (five rabbits) (Fig. 2F) were observed in the rabbits in the intranasal inoculation group. The s4 was re-isolated from the following tissue samples collected from rabbits in the intranasal inoculation group: tracheas (n = 8/8), lungs (n = 8/8), livers (n = 8/8), hearts (n = 0/8), spleens (n = 0/8), kidneys (n = 0/8) and blood (n = 0/8). Histologically, inflammatory exudates appeared in the bronchiole and alveoli as well as degeneration of the alveolar epithelial cells were observed in the lung of the rabbit with hemorrhagic pneumonia (Fig. 3A), inflammatory exudates in the bronchiole and alveoli as well as proliferation of alveolar epithelial cells were shown in lungs of the two rabbits with pulmonary consolidation and weak hemorrhagic pneumonia (Fig. 3B), only proliferation of alveolar epithelial cells was shown in lungs of the five rabbits with weak hemorrhagic pneumonia (Fig. 3C). Interestingly, all the eight rabbits in the subcutaneous inoculation group and five rabbits in the intranasal inoculation group were serological positivity for P. multocida IgG on 15 days post challenge. During the 15-day experimental period, all the rabbits in the control group remained P. multocida free, and showed no clinical signs and gross lesions of disease.Fig. 2Clinical signs and gross lesions of the rabbits challenged with s4.

Interestingly, the complete genome of s4 consisted of a chromosome and a plasmid. The complete genome of the s4 has been deposited to the NCBI GenBank database under the accession numbers of CP084165 (chromosome) and CP084164 (plasmid). The chromosome of s4 was 1,781,242 bp in length with the G + C content of 40.42%, in which 1619 protein coding sequences, 45 tRNA genes, 19 rRNA genes, 3 Genomic islands (GIs) and 2 intact prophages were determined (Fig. 4A). The plasmid of s4 was 274,750 bp in length with the G + C content of 39.62%, in which 302 protein coding sequences, 7 tRNA genes, 2 GIs and one intact prophage were determined (Fig. 4B). Interestingly, BLAST analysis showed that the plasmid of s4 was highly homologous (up to 85% identity) with the other P. multocida genomes at nucleotide level (Fig. 5). By blasting against the Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Database (CARD), two elfamycin resistance genes and one cephalosporin resistance gene were predicted, and all of the three drug resistance genes were located in the chromosome of s4.Fig. 4Circular maps of the s4 genome generated by using DNAPlotter.

Therefore, the genome of s4 was compared with that of Pm70. By comparing with the genome of Pm70, gene rearrangement, gain and loss were observed in that of s4. Especially, three large regions (R) of specific sequences were found in the genome of s4 (Fig. 6). Two regions (R1 and R2) located in the chromosome and were approximately 31.9 kb and 37.0 kb in length, respectively. The third region (R3) located in the plasmid and was approximately 42.3 kb in length. Interestingly, all of the three regions located in the intact phage regions that were determined in s4 genome by using PHAST [18]. Additionally, one unique gene (LCY73_01710) encoding the TonB-dependent receptor was identified in the genome of s4 but absent in that of Pm70.Fig. 6Colinear analyses between the genomes of s4 and Pm70. s4-Chr and s4-P represent the chromosome and plasmid of s4, respectively. Rectangle of the same colour indicates the similar local colinear block of the s4 and Pm70. R1, R2 and R3 indicate the three large regions of specific sequences in the genome of s4 but not in that of Pm70  The entire cap locus of s4 were compared with those of Pm70 (capsular type F), HN07 (capsular type F), CIRMBP-0873 (capsular type F), CIRMBP-0884 (capsular type F), CQ2 (capsular type A) and HN06 (capsular type D). The result showed that the entire cap locus of s4 was highly matched with those of capsular type F strains (Pm70, HN07, CIRMBP-0873 and CIRMBP-0884), and the entire cap locus of s4 was closely matched with that of capsular type A strain (CQ2) but was distinct from that of capsular type D strain (HN06) (Fig. 7).Fig. 7Comparative analyses of the entire cap locus between the s4 and other P. multocida strains. The entire cap locus of the s4 were compared with those of Pm70 (capsular type F), HN07 (capsular type F), CIRMBP-0873 (capsular type F), CIRMBP-0884 (capsular type F), CQ2 (capsular type A) and HN06 (capsular type D). The color code represents the BLASTn identity  The LPS outer core biosynthetic genes of s4 were compared with that of Pm70. All of the LPS outer core biosynthetic genes of Pm70 were located in the chromosome, whereas these genes were located in the plasmid of s4. With the exception of natC and gatF, the LPS outer core biosynthetic genes of s4 including gatG, natB, gctC and hptE were highly matched with those of Pm70. Interestingly, an in-frame deletion of 183-bp nucleotide (in positions 559–741) was observed in the natC of s4, which resulted in a deletion of 61 amino acids (in positions 183–243) of the glycosyltransferase NatC of s4 by comparison with that of Pm70 (Fig. 8). Additionally, the gatF of s4 possessed a 210-bp nucleotide sequence redundance at the N-terminal by comparison with that of Pm70 (Fig. 8).Fig. 8Comparative analyses of the LPS outer core locus of s4. The genes required for the assembly of the LPS outer core of s4 were compared with those of CIRMBP-0873 (LPS genotype L3), CIRMBP-0884 (LPS genotype L3) and Pm70 (LPS genotype L3).

PMC9310698,Abstract,Abstract,AL645882,0,0,0,,,"  Abstract  The qualified presumption of safety (QPS) approach was developed to provide a regularly updated generic pre‐evaluation of the safety of microorganisms, intended for use in the food or feed chains, to support the work of EFSA's Scientific Panels. The QPS approach is based on an assessment of published data for each agent, with respect to its taxonomic identity, the body of relevant knowledge, safety concerns and occurrence of antimicrobial resistance. Safety concerns identified for a taxonomic unit (TU) are, where possible, confirmed at the species/strain or product level and reflected by ‘qualifications’. In the period covered by this statement, no new information was found that would change the status of previously recommended QPS TUs. Of the 50 microorganisms notified to EFSA in October 2021 to March 2022 (inclusive), 41 were not evaluated: 10 filamentous fungi, 1 Enterococcus faecium, 1 Clostridium butyricum, 3 Escherichia coli and 1 Streptomyces spp. because are excluded from QPS evaluation, and 25 TUs that have already a QPS status. Nine notifications, corresponding to seven TUs were evaluated: four of these, Streptococcus salivarius, Companilactobacillus formosensis, Pseudonocardia autotrophica and Papiliotrema terrestris, being evaluated for the first time. The other three, Microbacterium foliorum, Pseudomonas fluorescens and Ensifer adhaerens were re‐assessed. None of these TUs were recommended for QPS status: Ensifer adhaerens, Microbacterium foliorum, Companilactobacillus formosensis and Papiliotrema terrestris due to a limited body of knowledge, Streptococcus salivarius due to its ability to cause bacteraemia and systemic infection that results in a variety of morbidities, Pseudonocardia autotrophica due to lack of body of knowledge and uncertainty on the safety of biologically active compounds which can be produced, and Pseudomonas fluorescens due to possible safety concerns.

To complete the assessment an ELS‐based approach may have been applied. In the current Panel Statement, this ELS approach was applied for assessing the QPS status of Ensifer adhaerens and Streptococcus salivarius. The ELS followed the same methodology as used for monitoring new safety concerns related to species with QPS status.

PMC9310698,Assessment,Other,AL645882,1,0,0,,,"  3  Assessment  The search strategy (key words, literature databases, number of papers found) followed for the assessment of the suitability of TUs notified to EFSA for their inclusion in the updated QPS list (reply to ToR 3) can be found in Appendix A.  3.1  Taxonomic units evaluated during the previous QPS mandate and re‐evaluated in the current statement  3.1.1  Bacteria  Ensifer adhaerens synonym Sinorhizobium adhaerens  A new evaluation of Ensifer adhaerens was made because an update was requested in relation to the new QPS mandate. E. adhaerens was not recommended for the QPS list in the previous assessment due to a lack of body of knowledge (EFSA, 2011).  Identity  E. adhaerens is a valid taxonomic unit. Sinorhizobium adhaerens is a synonym (Cassida, 1982; Willems et al., 2003). Sinorhizobium morelense (Wang et al., 2002) and Ensifer morelensis (Wang et al., 2013, Oren and Garrity, 2015) are previously used names without nomenclature validation. All synonyms were included in the literature searches.  Body of knowledge  The literature search was concentrated on papers since 2011. Ensifer adhaerens is a rhizosphere inhabiting bacterium with the ability to genetically transform several plants species (Rudder et al., 2014). E. adhaerens strains have been isolated in relation to N2 fixing (Katiyar et al., 2021), biosorption and biodegradation potential (Xu et al., 2016, Mesa et al., 2017), ligninolytic potential (Falade et al., 2017), exopolysaccharide production (Marques Alvarez et al., 2018), degradation of neonicotinoid insecticides (Sun et al., 2021, Zhao et al., 2021), vitamin B production (Thi Vu et al., 2013), mineral weathering capacity (Wang et al., 2016), alliinase production with antimicrobial activity (Yutani et al., 2011) and growth promotion potential (Zhumakayev et al., 2021).  Safety concerns  The safety of Vitamin B12, produced by a strain of E. adhaerens has been assessed by EFSA (EFSA FEEDAP Panel, 2020). WGS confirmed the absence of any known virulence gene and no toxic compounds are expected to be produced during fermentation. No other references addressed food safety issues.  Conclusion on a recommendation for QPS status  E. adhaerens (synonym Sinorhizobium adhaerens) is not recommended for the QPS list due to lack of body of knowledge for its occurrence in the food and feed chain.  Microbacterium foliorum  A new evaluation of Microbacterium foliorum was made because an update was requested in relation to the new QPS mandate. M. foliorum was not recommended for the QPS list due to lack of body of knowledge (EFSA BIOHAZ Panel, 2019b). In the period between 2019 and 2022, only one relevant article was found related to the safety of M. foliorum. Fu et al. (2021) studied the microbiological load of urban air dust by a metagenomic approach and found an association of M. foliorum with the occurrence of wheeze, rhinitis and rhinoconjunctivitis; a causal relationship was not investigated.  Conclusion on a recommendation for QPS status  M. foliorum is not to be recommended for the QPS list due to lack of body of knowledge for its occurrence in the food and feed chain.  Pseudomonas fluorescens  A new evaluation of Pseudomonas fluorescens was made because an update was requested in relation to the new QPS mandate. P. fluorescens was considered as unsuitable for QPS in 2016 and 2019 assessments because some strains raise safety concerns (EFSA BIOHAZ Panel, 2016, 2019a).  In recent years, it was recognised that many strains, reported to be P. fluorescens, are incorrectly identified (Morimoto et al., 2020). Moreover, several studies reporting safety concerns do not mention the method used for identification of the pathogen or used, only 16S rRNA sequence as identification tool which has been shown to be insufficiently discriminative.  Studies, based on correct identification of P. fluorescens, are lacking to clarify the possible safety concerns reported in relation to P. fluorescens.  Conclusion on a recommendation for QPS status  P. fluorescens is not recommended for the QPS list due to possible safety concerns.  3.2  Taxonomic units to be evaluated for the first time  3.2.1  Bacteria  Companilactobacillus formosensis previously known as Lactobacillus formosensis  Identity  Companilactobacillus formosensis is a bacterial species of heterofermentative Lactobacillaceae with standing in nomenclature (Chang et al., 2015; Zheng et al., 2020). It was originally described as Lactobacillus formosensis by Chang et al. (2015) and then assigned to the genus Companilactobacillus by Zheng et al. (2020).  Body of knowledge  Very limited information is available on the C. formosensis species, other than the taxonomical identification. The type strain of this species (strain S215) has the potential to be used as a sweet potato vine silage inoculant because of its ability to improve fermentability and aerobic stability (Mangwe et al., 2016).  Safety concerns  No information has been published.  Conclusion on a recommendation for QPS status  C. formosensis (previously known as Lactobacillus formosensis) is not recommended for the QPS list due to lack of body of knowledge for its occurrence in the food and feed chain.  Pseudonocardia autotrophica  Identity  P. autotrophica is a filamentous actinomycete that was initially classified into the genus Streptomyces (Takamiya and Tubaki, 1956) and later transferred to the genus Pseudonocardia (Warwick et al., 1994). It is a valid species with standing in Nomenclature.  Body of knowledge  P. autotrophica has been reported to produce an antifungal compound belonging to the tetraene‐family, nystatin‐like Pseudonocardia polyene A1 (NPP A1) (Lee et al., 2012; Han et al., 2019; Park et al., 2020). It is also used for the production of biosurfactants (Kuznetsov et al., 2020), and as a biocatalyst for the commercial production of a cytochrome P‐450 hydroxylase of vitamin D3 (Fujii et al., 2009).  Safety concerns  The genome sequences of two P. autotrophica isolates have been published (Grumaz et al., 2017; Yoshida et al., 2018) and, in addition, another two have been deposited in the data bases. A search done by the QPS WG for secondary metabolite gene‐clusters using the antiSmash platform (Blin et al., 2021) revealed a cluster corresponding to a nystatin‐like polyene in one of the strains, DSM 43083 (GenBank: MIFY01000001.1), similar to the one previously described in P. autotrophica KCTC9441 (GenBank: EU108007.1), whose characterisation revealed antifungal activity against Candida albicans (Kim et al., 2009). Additionally, over 10 clusters that encoded potential polyketides and non‐ribosomally synthesized peptides (NRP) related to known biologically active compounds were identified, albeit with different degrees of similarity to the original genomic sequences. Among them, a 100% similarity was found to an alkylresorcinol polyketide (Genbank: AP009493.1) and 72% and 45% to the NRPs heterobactin (GenBank: AP008957.1) and coelibactin (GenBank: AL645882.2) respectively. There is lack of information on the safety of these secondary metabolites.  Conclusion on a recommendation for QPS status  P. autotrophica is not recommended for the QPS list due to lack of body of knowledge and uncertainty on the safety of biologically active compounds which can be produced.  Streptococcus salivarius  Identity  Streptococcus salivarius is a species with standing in nomenclature (Farrow and Collins, 1984). During the period 1984–1995, the species S. salivarius included also S. thermophilus as a subspecies (S. salivarius subsp. thermophilus). Later studies based on 16S rRNA gene comparison showed that, although being closely related to S. salivarius, S. thermophilus is a different species (Kawamura et al., 1995; Pombert et al., 2009). Genome analyses confirmed this view (Delorme et al., 2015).  Body of knowledge  This species is a human and animal commensal. Some strains are used as oral probiotics to limit nasopharyngeal infections, as supported by several papers in peer‐reviewed journals (Zupancic et al., 2017; Wilcox et al., 2019). Recent scientific articles focus on the safety assessment of some of the probiotic strains (Li et al., 2021; Hale et al., 2022).  Safety concerns  S. salivarius is a common inhabitant of the oropharynx and, as such, has been associated with halitosis and caries (Sterer and Rosenberg, 2006; Gross et al., 2012). From this and other sources, it can result in bacteraemia (Corredoira et al., 2005; Molinaro et al., 2014; Akbulut et al., 2018), which can be followed by meningitis (Srinivasan et al., 2012), endocarditis (Knudtzen et al., 2015), peritoneal/gallbladder (Urade et al., 2018) and brain (Mandapat et al., 2011) abscesses and prosthesis‐associated infections (Olson et al., 2019) among other morbidities. These diseases were found in immunocompromised and immunocompetent patients.  Antimicrobial resistance  Transmissible resistances to macrolides, phenicols, penicillins and tetracyclines have been reported, their determinants being allocated to transposons, and other mobile and integrative genetic elements (Chaffanel et al., 2015; Palma et al., 2016).  Conclusion on a recommendation for QPS status  S. salivarius is not recommended for the QPS list due to its ability to cause bacteraemia and systemic infection that results in a variety of morbidities.  3.2.2  Yeasts  Papiliotrema terrestris synonym Cryptococcus terrestris  Identity  Papiliotrema terrestris is a basidiomycetous yeast belonging to the Tremellaceae in the subphylum Agaricomycotina. The genus Papiliotrema was first proposed in 2002 to accommodate the new species Papiliotrema bandonii (Sampaio et al., 2002), and it has been revised in 2015 by Liu et al. (2015). The species P. terrestris was described by Crestani et al. (2009) as Cryptococcus terrestris. It was ubiquitously found in the soil and the species has recently been reclassified as Papiliotrema terrestris (Miccoli et al., 2020; Li et al., 2020).  Body of knowledge  Since the species is rather recently described the body of knowledge is limited. Some strains of this species are proposed as biocontrol agents and the majority of the strains are isolated from plants, fruits and soil. The type strain CBS 101036 is patented under the name C. nodaensis to produce salt‐tolerant and thermostable glutaminase (US Patent US006063409A; Sato et al., 1999). Isolate CBS 942 (NRRL Y‐1401, cited as C. laurentii or C. laurentii var. flavescens) produces an acidic extracellular polysaccharide, which contains d‐xylose, d‐mannose, d‐glucuronic acid and O‐acetyl (Abercrombie et al., 1960; Slodki et al., 1966; De Baets and Vandamme, 2001, De Baets et al., 2002).  The complete genome sequence of the biocontrol yeast P. terrestris strain LS28P is available in GenBank.  Safety concerns  According to Crestani et al. (2009) and Kurtzman et al. (2011), P. terrestris is phylogenetically closely related to C. laurentii and C. flavescens (syn. C. laurentii) which has been associated with some infections (Kurtzman 2011; Intra et al., 2021; Zono et al., 2021).  Conclusion on a recommendation for QPS status  P. terrestris is not recommended for the QPS list due to a limited body of knowledge.  3.3  Monitoring of new safety concerns related to organisms on the QPS list  The summaries of the evaluation of the possible safety concerns for humans, animals or the environment described and published since the previous ELS exercise (i.e. articles published between July and December 2021 as described in Appendices B and C) with reference to the articles selected as potentially relevant for the QPS exercise (Appendix D) for each of the TUs or groups of TUs that are part of the QPS list (Appendix E), are presented below.  3.3.1  Gram‐positive non‐sporulating bacteria  Bifidobacterium spp.  A search for papers potentially relevant for QPS‐listed Bifidobacterium spp. provided 359 references. The AI analysis left 180. Title screening left 10 references for abstract screening, then 3 for a full article appraisal. This last step discarded two articles because no safety concern was found. One was found relevant (D'Agostin et al., 2021) but because it is a study review referring to articles that have been already part of previous ELS exercises, it was not further considered. Consequently, the QPS status of these species is not changed.  Carnobacterium divergens  A search for potentially relevant papers on C. divergens provided six references. No article was considered relevant at the level of title screening for this TU. Consequently, the QPS status of C. divergens is not changed.  Corynebacterium glutamicum  A search for papers potentially relevant to the QPS evaluation of C. glutamicum provided 23 references. Two papers reached the level of title and abstract screening and one reach full‐text evaluation but no new safety concerns were identified and the QPS status of C. glutamicum is not changed.  Lactobacilli  Analysis of papers referring to any of the QPS species, formerly belonging to the genus Lactobacillus and recently split into 13 new genera, provided 942 references. The AI analysis left 471 articles. Title screening of these provided 25 references for abstract screening, which further reduced their number to 7. Three of them did not raise safety concerns, one was on L. paragasseri, which is not a QPS organism, and the other three (Aydogan et al., 2021; Miwa et al., 2021; Pietrangelo et al., 2021) although relevant, were excluded because no reliable microorganism identification procedures were described, or due to uncertainty on the aetiology of the cases described. Moreover, the patients affected were a newborn baby that presented a congenital hypoplastic left heart syndrome, an 88‐year‐old lady with terminal pancreatitis and uncontrolled diabetes and a middle‐aged alcoholic man, i.e.: all of them presented serious morbidities that might have allowed the opportunistic infections described.  Based on the available evidence as described above, the status of any of the QPS species included in the group of lactobacilli is not changed.  Lactococcus lactis  A search for papers potentially relevant for the QPS status of L. lactis provided 213 references. The AI analysis left 110 papers. Title and abstract screenings reduced their numbers to 12 and 5, respectively. One of them did not raise safety concerns, another did not deal with L. lactis, and identification of the causal microorganism was not reliable for two of the remaining cases, only phenotypical methods were used (Ahmed et al., 2021; Gurley et al., 2021). The third (Rowe et al., 2021) was on comparison of different algorithms to predict occurrence of cow mastitis.  Based on the available evidence as described above, the QPS status of L. lactis is not changed.  Leuconostoc spp.  A search for papers potentially relevant for the QPS evaluation of Leuconostoc species provided 76 references. The analysis of their titles left five articles for title/abstract screening. Two articles reached full text evaluation, but neither dealt with possible safety concerns. Consequently, the status of QPS‐listed Leuconostoc spp. is not changed.  Microbacterium imperiale  A search for papers potentially relevant for the QPS evaluation of M. imperiale provided 1 reference but was not relevant for title/abstract screening. Consequently, the QPS status of M. imperiale is not changed.  Oenococcus oeni  A search for papers potentially relevant for the QPS evaluation of Oenococcus oeni provided 29 references. The analysis of their titles left no articles for title/abstract screening. Consequently, the QPS status of O. oeni is not changed.  Pediococcus spp.  A search for papers potentially relevant for the QPS evaluation of Pediococcus spp. provided 175 references. The analysis of their titles left two articles for the title/abstract phase. No article reached the full text evaluation stage, consequently, the status of QPS‐listed Pediococcus spp. is not changed.  Propionibacterium spp.  A search for papers potentially relevant for the QPS evaluation of Propionibacterium spp. provided 24 references. Following the analysis of their titles, no article was selected for abstract screening or the full article evaluation phase, consequently, the status of QPS‐listed Propionibacterium spp. is not changed.  Streptococcus thermophilus  A search for papers potentially relevant for the QPS evaluation of Streptococcus thermophilus provided 80 references. The analysis of their titles left 4 articles for title and abstract screening, which did not deal with safety concerns. Therefore, no article reached the evaluation phase, and the QPS status of S. thermophilus is not changed.  3.3.2  Gram‐positive spore‐forming bacteria  A search for papers potentially relevant for Bacillus spp. and Geobacillus stearothermophilus provided 1,416 references. The AI analysis left 676 articles. The analysis of their titles left 15 articles for the abstract phase and, from these, 9 articles passed to the full‐text phase for further analysis.  Bacillus spp.  All nine articles that passed to the full text phase for further analysis were related to Bacillus spp. Three papers did not deal with safety concerns. Six papers were further analysed. One paper (D'Agostin et al., 2021) reviewed human case reports related to probiotic intake of B. clausii which were already discussed in previous EFSA statements. Four papers had methodology problems related to the identification methodology used (Garcia et al., 2021; Severiche‐Bueno et al., 2021; Lampropoulos et al., 2021) and/or the source attribution (Konate et al., 2021; Severiche‐Bueno et al., 2021). Three papers described predisposing factors for the infection (Garcia et al., 2021; Konate et al., 2021; Lampropoulos et al., 2021). One paper (Liu et al., 2021) presented phylogenetic and phylogenomic results based on the genome sequences of 96 B. amyloliquefaciens strains from different sources, mentioning the presence of possible virulence genes in strains. For most of these genes there is no information of a direct link with the enhancement of the capacity to cause infection. One strain (MBGja9) was shown to carry genes from the isd cluster that were previously described to be connected with virulence of Staphylococcus sp. (Naushad et al., 2019). Publicly available genome (assembly number ASM291526v1) of this strain revealed an assembly anomaly, not allowing the confirmation of the linkage of these genes with B. amyloliquefaciens.  2  Through the ELS, the WG did not identify any information that would change the status of members of Bacillus spp. included in the QPS list.  Geobacillus stearothermophilus  None of the nine articles that passed to the full‐text phase for further analysis dealt with this species. Consequently, the QPS status of G. stearothermophilus is not changed.  Pasteuria nishizawae  A search for papers potentially relevant for the QPS evaluation of P. nishizawae provided 1 reference that did not reach the full text stage. Consequently, the QPS status of P. nishizawae is not changed.  3.3.3  Gram‐negative bacteria  A search for papers potentially relevant to the QPS evaluation of Gluconobacter oxidans, Xanthomonas campestris, Cupriavidus necator and Komagataeibacter sucrofermentans provided in total 260 references.  Cupriavidus necator  A search for papers potentially relevant for C. necator provided 73 references. The analysis of the titles left three papers, but none dealt with this species. Consequently, the QPS status of C. necator is not changed.  Gluconobacter oxydans  A search for papers potentially relevant for G. oxydans provided 32 references. The analysis of the titles left three papers, but none dealt with this species. Consequently, the QPS status of G. oxydans is not changed.  Komagataeibacter sucrofermentans  A search for papers potentially relevant for K. sucrofermentans provided 16 references. The analysis of the titles left three papers, but none dealt with this species. Consequently, the QPS status of K. sucrofermentans is not changed.  Xanthomonas campestris  A search for papers potentially relevant for X. campestris provided 139 references. The analysis of the titles left 3 articles, 1 reached the full‐text phase but no safety concern was identified. Consequently, the QPS status of X. campestris is not changed.  3.3.4  Yeasts  The ELS searches for potentially relevant studies on the yeasts with QPS status provided 1,613 references. The AI analysis left 802 articles. After title screening, 92 studies remained for the title/abstract phase, and from these 19 articles passed to the full article appraisal. All of these 19 reported a possible safety concern.  The 19 studies that discussed potentially relevant safety concerns for QPS yeast species are discussed below.  For the species   Candida cylindracea, Kluyveromyces lactis, Komagataella pastoris, Komagataella phaffi, Ogataea angusta, Saccharomyces bayanus, Saccharomyces pastorianus, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Xanthophyllomyces dendrorhous, Yarrowia lipolytica and Zygosaccharomyces rouxii,   no safety concerns were reported. Consequently, the QPS status does not change for these species.  Cyberlindnera jadinii  The anamorph name of C. jadinii is Candida utilis.  Three references related to possible concerns for human safety were identified by Mohzari (2021), Sreelekshmi et al. (2021) and Sharma and Chauhan (2020).  Mohzari et al. (2021) reported a case of nosocomial meningitis by C. jadinii and the bacterium Stenotrophomonas maltophilia in a patient that had been subject to neurosurgery. The yeast identification by MALDI‐TOF MS was not confirmed by molecular analyses.  In a retrospective study in a hospital in India (Sreelekshmi et al., 2021), three of the “Candida spp.” Blood culture isolates (1.5% of total Candida) were C. jadinii. Two patients were neonates and one a four‐day‐old baby. All three cases shared a risk factor of intensive care unit stay, but the sources of the infections were not known. Two of the patients responded well to treatment. One was first treated for meningitis (caused by unidentified Pseudomonas), but then developed endocarditis with blood cultures growing Staphylococcus aureus and C. jadinii.  Sharma and Chauhan (2020) report a case of osteomyelitis (bone infection) by C. jadinii in a 9‐month old boy, who was immunosuppressed. However, the species identification is uncertain since no information was provided about which methods were used.  The reports on C. jadinii did not add any new information that would change the current QPS status of this species.  Debaryomyces hansenii  The anamorph name of D. hansenii is Candida famata.  One reference related to possible concerns for human safety was identified. Sakamoto et al. (2021) reported that five (3.3%) of the ‘Candida’ isolates from the blood of hospitalised patients with underlying disease or other predisposing conditions in a hospital in Japan were D. hansenii. However, species identification was only by standard biochemical growth test and is therefore very uncertain.  The report on D. hansenii did not add any new information that would change the current QPS status of this species.  Hanseniaspora uvarum  The anamorph name of H. uvarum is Kloeckera apiculata.  One reference related to possible concerns for human safety was identified. Sanchez‐Cardenas et al. (2021) reported onychomycosis (nail infection) with H. uvarum in a woman with multiple sclerosis, but the species identification is not definite, since standard CHROMagar showed Candida glabrata and MALDI‐TOF MS suggested H. uvarum. No molecular confirmation was performed.  The report on H. uvarum did not add any new information that would change the current QPS status of this species.  Kluyveromyces marxianus  The anamorph name of K. marxianus is Candida kefyr.  Three publications contribute with information related to human safety concerns, and all three present identification problems (Singh et al., 2020; Jain et al., 2021,; Zyrek, 2021). Singh et al. (2020) claim that 2 clinical isolates from patients with suspected candidiasis in a hospital in India were Candida kefyr. Since the species identification is very uncertain and the paper lacks information regarding any predisposing conditions in the patients, the importance of the results cannot be appropriately assessed. Zyrek et al. (2021) provided no relevant information about this species.  The papers did not identify any information that would change the QPS status of K. marxianus.  Saccharomyces cerevisiae  The anamorph form of S. cerevisiae is not described. A synonym of this species is Saccharomyces boulardii.  Five publications reported safety concerns for humans and in four of them, the identification is uncertain. Four of them published fungaemia cases linked to the use of S. boulardii as a probiotic. Pinto et al., (2021) described a case of a fungal infection caused by S. cerevisiae in a critically ill COVID‐19 patient in an intensive care unit (ICU) after supplementation with Saccharomyces. Rannikko et al. (2021) also reported fungaemia cases linked to the use of S. boulardii probiotic in Finland hospitals from 2009 to 2018. Wombwell et al., (2021) report a retrospective study of 16.404 hospitalised patients in a medical care centre in the US. All subjects received S. boulardii as a preventative probiotic and were investigated for S. cerevisiae/S. boulardii in blood. Even though the subjects were hospitalised with underlying disease or trauma, and the majority of the patients admitted to intensive care had a central catheter, the fungaemia incidence was very low (0.1%). D'Agostin et al. (2021) make a systematic review of fungal infections due to intake of S. boulardii as a probiotic. Each of the 14 patients in the cited studies reporting infection with S. boulardii had underlying conditions.  Imre et al., (2021) compared the general phenotypic and virulence factors of 14 S. boulardii isolates, four from probiotic products and 10 clinical isolates, of which two were from patients diagnosed with mycosis. The authors conclude that some strains in probiotic products possess features that enable them to act as pathogens when conditions are permissive, and whether they can enter the bloodstream is mainly due to factors related to the host.  These new reports of S. cerevisiae did not add any new information that indicates change in the current QPS status of this species. The current QPS status of S. cerevisiae is not changed.  Wickerhamomyces anomalus  The anamorph name of W. anomalus is Candida pelliculosa.  Four references related to possible concerns for human safety were identified: Zhang et al. (2021), Yasuj et al. (2021), Koutserimpas et al. (2021), Yang (2021).  Zhang et al. (2021) reported 13 cases of W. anomalus fungaemia (positive blood cultures) in a 2.5‐year retrospective study in a hospital in China. Identification was by MALDI‐TOF MS but no further molecular confirmation was provided. All patients were hospitalised and had underlying disease and/or other predisposing conditions. There are uncertainties regarding W. anomalus as the etiological agent, since eight of the 13 subjects had mixed bacterial/Candida infection and four mixed candidemia. The isolates´ susceptibility to azoles were comparatively low and other classes of antimycotics were therefore recommended for treatment.  In a retrospective study in a hospital in Iran (2016–2019), blood samples were taken from 800 patients (Yasuj et al., 2021). One of the 27 with confirmed candidemia (in intensive care unit because of urinary tract infection with unknown agent) showed growth of W. anomalus. The isolate was susceptible to all tested antimycotics (fluconazole, amphotericin B and caspofungin).  Koutserimpas et al. (2021) reviewed reports of ‘non‐Candida’ opportunistic infections after prosthetic joint arthroplasty. Out of the 42 retrieved cases globally for the period 1981–2018, five were W. anomalus. A thorough evaluation of the implications of this review cannot be performed since no details are provided regarding identification methods.  W. anomalus has occasionally caused nosocomial outbreaks of opportunistic infections in neonatal intensive care units. Yang et al. (2021) provides two additional cases of fungaemia in 2012 and 2013 in a hospital in China. All isolates were susceptible to all five tested antimycotic substances and infections were successfully treated.  The literature update did not identify any information that would change the current QPS status of W. anomalus.  3.3.5  Protists  Aurantiochytrium limacinum  A search for papers potentially relevant for A. limacinum provided 22 articles. The analysis of their titles left 1 article, but this paper did not reach the full article evaluation stage, thus no new safety concern was identified. Therefore, the current QPS status of A. limacinum is not changed.  3.3.6  Algae  A search for papers potentially relevant for algae provided 240 articles. The analysis of their titles left 17 articles and for 4 of these the full text was analysed.  Euglena gracilis  No article dealt with potential safety concerns of E. gracilis. Therefore, the current QPS status of E. gracilis is not changed.  Haematococcus lacustris synonym Haematococcus pluvialis  No article dealt with potential safety concerns of H. lacustris. Therefore, the current QPS status of H. lacustris is not changed.  Tetraselmis chuii  No article dealt with potential safety concerns of T. chuii. Therefore, the current QPS status of T. chuii is not changed.  3.3.7  Viruses used for plant protection  Alphaflexiviridae and Potyviridae  A search for papers potentially relevant for the QPS evaluation of viruses of the Alphaflexiviridae and Potyviridae provided 55 references. After title screening, no paper reached the title/abstract screening stage, thus no new safety concern was identified. Therefore, the current QPS status remains unchanged.  Baculoviridae  A search for papers potentially relevant for the QPS evaluation of Baculoviridae provided 59 references. Two articles dealing with Baculoviridae passed the title screening but did not reach the full article evaluation stage, thus no new safety concern was identified. Therefore, the current QPS status remains unchanged.  ",TRUE,TRUE,

ToR 2: Review taxonomic units previously recommended for the QPS list and their qualifications when new information has become available:  •In relation to the results of the monitoring of possible new safety concerns relevant for the QPS list, there were no results that would justify removal of any TUs from the QPS list.  ToR 3: (Re)assess the suitability of taxonomic units notified to EFSA not present in the current QPS list for their inclusion in that list:  •Out of the 50 notifications received between October 2021 and March 2022, 25 were related to TUs that already had QPS status and therefore did not require further evaluation.•Of the remaining 25 notifications, 16 notifications were related to microorganisms that are excluded from QPS evaluation (10 were notifications of filamentous fungi, 1 of Clostridium butyricum (bacterium), 1 of Enterococcus faecium (bacterium), 3 of Escherichia coli (bacterium), 1 of Streptomyces sp. (bacterium).•Nine of the 50 notifications received, corresponding to 7 TUs, were evaluated for possible QPS status: four of these (Companilactobacillus formosensis, Pseudonocardia autotrophica, Streptococcus salivarius and Papiliotrema terrestris) being evaluated for the first time. The other three, Ensifer adhaerens, Microbacterium foliorum and Pseudomonas fluorescens were re‐assessed because an update was requested in relation to the current mandate. The following conclusions were drawn:  ○  Companilactobacillus formosensis (previously known as Lactobacillus formosensis) is not recommended for the QPS list due to lack of body of knowledge for its occurrence in the food and feed chain.○  Ensifer adhaerens (synonym Sinorhizobium adhaerens) is not recommended for the QPS list due to lack of body of knowledge for its occurrence in the food and feed chain.○  Microbacterium foliorum is not recommended for the QPS list due to lack of body of knowledge for its occurrence in the food and feed chain.○  Pseudonocardia autotrophica is not recommended for the QPS list due to lack of body of knowledge and uncertainty on the safety of biologically active compounds which can be produced.○  Pseudomonas fluorescens is not recommended for the QPS list due to possible safety concerns.○  Papiliotrema. terrestris is not recommended for the QPS list due to a limited body knowledge.○  Streptococcus salivarius is not recommended for the QPS list due to its ability to cause bacteraemia and systemic infection that results in a variety of morbidities.

The literature review considered the information on taxonomy, the body of knowledge, the potential safety concerns related to human and animal health and to the environment (EFSA BIOHAZ Panel, 2020a) for each TU. The environmental risk assessment of plant protection products is not included in the QPS assessment but is carried out by the Pesticide Peer Review (PPR) Unit based on the risk assessment in the application. Information on relevant acquired antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is reflected in the safety sections.  Relevant databases, such as PubMed, Web of Science, CAB Abstracts or Food Science Technology Abstracts (FSTA) and Scopus, were searched, based on the judgement of the experts. To complete the assessment an ELS‐based approach may have been applied. In the current Panel Statement, this ELS approach was applied for assessing the QPS status of Ensifer adhaerens and Streptococcus salivarius. The ELS followed the same methodology as used for monitoring new safety concerns related to species with QPS status. More details on the search strategy, search keys, and approach for each of the assessments are described in Appendix A. Only the literature that is considered, based on expert judgement, to be relevant for the QPS assessment is reflected in the Statement.  Only valid TUs covered by the relevant international committees on the nomenclature for microorganisms are considered for the QPS assessment.  2.2  Methodologies  2.2.1  Evaluation of a QPS recommendation for taxonomic units notified to EFSA  In response to ToR 1, the EFSA Units were asked to update the list of microbiological agents being notified to EFSA. A total of 50 notifications were received between October 2021 and March 2022, of which 35 were for evaluation for use in feed, 11 for use as food enzymes, food additives and flavourings, 4 as novel foods and 0 as plant protection products (Table 1).

(b)  Nine notifications corresponding to seven TUs, four of these (Companilactobacillus formosensis, Pseudonocardia autotrophica, Streptococcus salivarius, and Papiliotrema terrestris) being evaluated for the first time. The other three, Ensifer adhaerens, Microbacterium foliorum and Pseudomonas fluorescens were re‐assessed because an update was requested in the current mandate.  In response to ToR 3, nine of the 50 notifications, corresponding to seven TUs, were evaluated for possible QPS status, four of these, Companilactobacillus formosensis, Pseudonocardia autotrophica, Streptococcus salivarius, and Papiliotrema terrestris, being evaluated for the first time. The other three, Ensifer adhaerens, Microbacterium foliorum and Pseudomonas fluorescens, were re‐assessed because an update was requested in the current mandate. The remaining 41 notifications were excluded from QPS evaluation for the following reasons: 17 notifications were related to microorganisms that are excluded from QPS evaluation (10 were notifications of filamentous fungi, 1 of Clostridium butyricum (bacterium), 1 of Enterococcus faecium (bacterium), 3 of Escherichia coli, 1 Streptomyces spp.) and 25 were related to TUs that already had QPS status and did not require further evaluation in this mandate.  2.2.2  Monitoring of new safety concerns related to species with QPS status  In reply to ToR 2, concerning the revision of the TUs previously recommended for the QPS list and their qualifications, an extensive literature search (ELS) was conducted as described in Appendix B – ELS protocol, see https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3607188, and in Appendix C Search strategies – see https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3607192, respectively.  The artificial intelligence (AI) function of DistillerSR was used for pre‐screening of papers for Bifidobacterium spp., lactobacilli, Lactococcus lactis, Bacillus spp. and yeasts, followed by a second screening of those articles carried out by two experts.  The aim of the ELS was to identify any publicly available scientific studies reporting on safety concerns for humans, animals or the environment, caused by QPS organisms since the previous QPS review (i.e. publications from July to December 2021).  For case reports of human infections or intoxications, important additional information includes whether any negative impacts are confined to persons with conditions favouring opportunistic infections, for example immunosuppression, and whether transmission occurred through food or other routes, when described (e.g. medical devices). Studies indicating the presence of virulence factors (e.g. toxins and enzymes that may contribute to the pathogenicity of the microorganism) in the TU are also reported as relevant when identifying potential safety concerns.  Several of the QPS‐TUs are sporadically reported as causing infections in individuals with recognised predisposing conditions for the acquisition of opportunistic infections, e.g. cardiovascular conditions associated with endocarditis, people in the lower or upper age spectrum, or with other conditions which can lead to impairment of the immunological system, such as patients subjected to transplants, undergoing cancer therapy, suffering from physical trauma or tissue damage, or HIV patients. Moreover, gastrointestinal tract‐related conditions with, for example mucosal impairment and/or proton pump inhibitors can also be predisposing factors for infection. Previous use of the microorganisms being assessed as food supplements for humans was reported in many of these cases. Nevertheless, the QPS assessment takes into consideration these reports, extracting relevant information whenever justified. For a detailed protocol of the process and search strategies, refer to Appendices B and C.  After removal of duplicates, 3,290 records were submitted to the title screening step, which led to the exclusion of 3,143 of these. The remaining 190 records were found eligible for the title and abstract screening step, which led to the exclusion of 66 of these. Of the 55 articles that finally reached the article evaluation step (full text), 32 were considered to report a potential safety concern and were further analysed.  The flow of records from their identification by the different search strategies (as reported in Appendix C) to their consideration as potentially relevant papers for QPS is shown in Table 2.

PMC9310698,Introduction,Introduction,AL645882,0,0,0,,,"  1  Introduction  The qualified presumption of safety (QPS) approach was developed by the EFSA Scientific Committee to provide a generic concept for risk assessment within the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) for microorganisms intentionally introduced into the food chain, in support of the respective Scientific Panels and Units in the context of market authorisations for their use in food and feed and requiring an EFSA safety assessment (EFSA, 2007). The list, first established in 2007, has been continuously revised and updated. A Panel Statement is published approximately every 6 months. These Panel Statements include the results of the assessment of relevant new papers related to the TUs with QPS status. They also contain the assessment of newly submitted TUs to the EFSA Units on Feed, Food Ingredients and Packaging (FIP), Nutrition, Pesticides and Genetically Modified Organisms (GMO). After 3 years, a QPS opinion is published summarising the results of the Panel Statements published in that period.  1.1  Background and Terms of Reference as provided by EFSA  A wide variety of microorganisms are intentionally added at different stages of the food and feed chains. In the context of applications for market authorisation of these microbiological agents used, either directly or as sources of food and feed additives, food enzymes and plant protection products, EFSA is requested to assess their safety.  EFSA's work on QPS activities began in 2004 when the Scientific Committee issued a scientific opinion in continuation of the 2003 working document ‘On a generic approach to the safety assessment of microorganisms used in feed/food and feed/food production’ prepared by a working group consisting of members of the former Scientific Committee on Animal Nutrition, the Scientific Committee on Food and the Scientific Committee on Plants of the European Commission.  1   The document, made available for public consultation, proposed the introduction of the concept of Qualified Presumption of Safety (QPS), to be applied to selected groups of microorganisms. Microorganisms not considered suitable for QPS status would remain subject to a full safety assessment. EFSA management asked its Scientific Committee to consider whether the QPS approach could be applied to the safety assessment of microorganisms across the various EFSA Scientific Panels. In doing so, the Committee was required to take into account the response of the stakeholders to the QPS approach. In its 2005 opinion (EFSA, 2005), the Scientific Committee concluded that the QPS approach could provide a generic assessment system that could be applied to all requests received by EFSA for the safety assessments of microorganisms deliberately introduced into the food and feed chain. Its introduction was intended to improve transparency and ensure consistency in the approach used across the EFSA Panels. Applications involving a taxonomic unit belonging to a species that falls within a QPS group do not require a full safety assessment.  Several taxonomic units (usually species for bacteria and yeasts; families for viruses) have been included in the QPS list, either following notifications to EFSA, or proposals made initially by stakeholders during a public consultation in 2005, even if they were not yet notified to EFSA (EFSA, 2005). The EFSA Scientific Committee reviewed the range and numbers of microorganisms likely to be the subject of an EFSA Opinion and, in 2007, published a list of microorganisms recommended for the QPS list.  In their 2007 opinion (EFSA, 2007), the Scientific Committee recommended that a QPS approach should provide a generic concept to prioritise and to harmonise safety risk assessment of microorganisms intentionally introduced into the food chain, in support of the respective Scientific Panels and EFSA Units in the frame of the market authorisations for their use in the food and feed chain. The same Committee recognised that there would have to be continuing provision for reviewing and modifying the QPS list and, in line with this recommendation, the EFSA Panel on Biological Hazards (BIOHAZ) took the prime responsibility for this and started reviewing annually the existing QPS list. In 2008, the first annual QPS update was published (EFSA, 2008).  In 2014, the BIOHAZ Panel, in consultation with the Scientific Committee, decided to change the revision procedure; the overall assessment of the taxonomic units previously recommended for the QPS list (EFSA BIOHAZ Panel, 2013) was no longer carried out annually but over a 3‐year period. From 2017, the search and revision of the possible safety concerns linked to those taxonomic units began instead to be carried out every 6 months through extensive literature searches (ELS). The update of the 2013 QPS list (EFSA BIOHAZ Panel, 2013) was done in 2016 (EFSA BIOHAZ Panel, 2017). From 2016 on, the QPS list (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1146566) and the list of notifications to EFSA (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3607183) are constantly updated, independent of the QPS opinion, and are available at the Knowledge Junction in Zenodo. The most recent QPS opinion (EFSA BIOHAZ Panel, 2020a) summarises the main results of the 3‐year ELS on the QPS TUs, together with an update of the process for granting QPS status. In the meantime, every 6 months a Panel Statement, compiling the assessments for a QPS status of the microbiological agents notified to EFSA requested by the Feed Unit, the Food Ingredients and Packaging (FIP) Unit, the Nutrition Unit, the Pesticides Unit and the Genetically Modified Organisms (GMO) Unit, as well as the summary of each 6‐month ELS exercise, has been produced and published. Each QPS Panel Statement contains the evaluations of the new notifications for microorganisms submitted for possible QPS status. It also contains the result of a standardised extensive literature search performed every 6 months regarding possible new safety concerns related to the TUs already included in the QPS list. The data identified are used to inform decisions on whether any TU may or may not remain on the QPS list, and whether any qualifications need to be revised.  Establishing a QPS status is based on four pillars: [1] the taxonomic grouping (TU) for which QPS is sought (‘taxonomic identification’); [2] whether sufficient relevant information is available about the proposed group of organisms to conclude on human/animal exposure via food/ feed (‘body of knowledge’); [3] whether the grouping proposed contains known ‘safety concerns’ and, finally, [4] the intended end use (‘intended use’). If a hazard related to a TU is identified, which can be tested at the strain or product level, a ‘qualification’ to exclude that hazard may be established and added. The subject of these qualifications for the microbial strain under investigation is evaluated by the EFSA Unit to which the application dossier has been allocated. Absence of acquired genes coding for resistance to antimicrobials relevant for humans and animals is a generic qualification for all bacterial TUs; the absence of antimycotic resistance should be proven if the pertinent yeasts are to be used as viable organisms in the food or feed chains. The qualification ‘for production purpose only’ implies the absence of viable cells of the production organism in the final product and can also be applied to food and feed products based on microbial biomass (EFSA BIOHAZ Panel, 2020a).  Because the QPS evaluation is, after its initial creation, only triggered through an application dossier notified to EFSA, the QPS list is not exhaustive.  In summary, the QPS evaluation provides a generic safety pre‐assessment approach for use within EFSA that covers safety concerns for humans, animals and the environment. In the QPS concept, a safety assessment of a defined taxonomic unit is performed independently of the legal framework under which the application is made in the course of an authorisation process. Although general human safety is part of the evaluation, specific issues relating to type and level of exposure of users handling the product (e.g. dermal contact, inhalation, ingestion) are not addressed. In the case of Genetically Modified Microorganisms (GMM) for which the species of the recipient strain qualifies for the QPS status, and for which the genetically modified state does not give rise to safety concerns, the QPS approach can be extended to genetically modified production strains (EFSA BIOHAZ Panel, 2018). The assessment of potential allergenic microbial residual components is beyond the QPS remit; however, if there is science‐based evidence for a microbial species it is reported. These aspects are separately assessed, where applicable, by the EFSA Panel responsible for assessing the application.  The lowest TU for which the QPS status is granted is the species level for bacteria, yeasts and protists/algae, and family for viruses.  Filamentous fungi, bacteriophages, Streptomycetes, Oomycetes, Enterococcus faecium, Escherichia coli and recently also Clostridium butyricum (EFSA BIOHAZ Panel, 2020a,b) are excluded from the QPS assessments based on an ambiguous taxonomic position or the possession of potentially harmful traits by some strains of the taxonomic unit, therefore requiring a specific assessment for each strain for which an application is made.  The Terms of Reference are as follows:  ToR 1: Keep updated the list of microbiological agents being notified in the context of a technical dossier to EFSA Units such as Feed, Pesticides, Food Ingredients and Packaging (FIP) and Nutrition, for intentional use directly or as sources of food and feed additives, food enzymes and plant protection products for safety assessment.  ToR 2: Review taxonomic units previously recommended for the QPS list and their qualifications when new information has become available. The latter is based on a review of the updated literature aiming to verify whether any new safety concern has arisen that could require the removal of a taxonomic unit from the list, and to verify if the qualifications still effectively exclude safety concerns.  ToR 3: (Re) assess the suitability of new taxonomic units notified to EFSA for their inclusion in the QPS list. These microbiological agents are notified to EFSA and requested by the Feed Unit, the FIP Unit, the Nutrition Unit or by the Pesticides Unit.  ",FALSE,TRUE,

PMC9310698,Summary,Other,AL645882,0,0,0,,,"  Summary  The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) asked the Panel on Biological Hazards (BIOHAZ) to deliver a Scientific Opinion on the maintenance of the qualified presumption of safety (QPS) list. The QPS list contains microorganisms, intentionally added to food and feed, which have achieved QPS status. The request included three specific tasks as mentioned in the Terms of Reference (ToRs).  The QPS process was developed to provide a harmonised generic pre‐evaluation procedure to support safety risk assessments of microorganisms performed by EFSA’s scientific Panels and Units. This process assesses the taxonomic identity, body of relevant knowledge and safety of microorganisms. Safety concerns identified for a taxonomic unit (TU) are, where possible, confirmed at strain or product level, reflected as ‘qualifications’ that should be assessed at the strain level by EFSA’s Scientific Panels. A generic qualification for all QPS bacterial TUs applies in relation to the absence of acquired genes conferring resistance to clinically relevant antimicrobials (EFSA, 2008).  The list of microorganisms is maintained and re‐evaluated approximately every 6 months in a Panel Statement. The Panel Statement also includes the evaluation of microbiological agents newly notified to EFSA within the previous 6‐month period.  The first ToR requires ongoing updates of the list of microbiological agents notified to EFSA, in the context of a technical dossier for safety assessment. The overall list (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3607183) was updated with the notifications received between October 2021 and March 2022. Within this period, 50 notifications were received by EFSA, of which 35 were proposed for evaluation in feed, 11 for use as food enzymes, food additives and flavourings and 4 as novel foods. The new notifications received between October 2021 and March 2022 are included in the current Statement (see Appendix F).  The second ToR concerns the revision of the TUs previously recommended for the QPS list and their qualifications. For this revision, articles published from July and December 2021 were assessed. The articles were retrieved and assessed through an extensive literature search (ELS) protocol available in Appendix B (see https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3607188) and the search strategies in Appendix C (see https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3607192). No new information was found that would affect the QPS status of those TUs or their qualifications.  The third ToR requires a (re)assessment of new TUs notified to EFSA, for their suitability for inclusion in the updated QPS list at the Knowledge Junction in Zenodo (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1146566, Appendix E – the link opens at the latest version of the QPS list, and also shows the versions associated to each Panel Statement).  Fifty notifications were received; 41 of these were not evaluated for the following reasons: 16 notifications were related to microorganisms that are excluded from QPS evaluation (10 were notifications of filamentous fungi, 1 Enterococcus faecium, 1 of Clostridium butyricum, 3 of Escherichia coli, 1 Streptomyces spp.), and 25 were related to TUs that already have QPS status and did not require further evaluation.  The remaining nine notifications, corresponding to seven TUs, were evaluated for possible QPS status: four of these (Companilactobacillus formosensis, Pseudonocardia autotrophica, Streptococcus salivarius and Papiliotrema terrestris) being evaluated for the first time. The other three, Ensifer adhaerens, Microbacterium foliorum and Pseudomonas fluorescens were re‐assessed because an update was requested in relation to the current mandate.  The following conclusions were drawn:  •  Companilactobacillus formosensis (previously known as Lactobacillus formosensis) is not recommended for the QPS list due to lack of body of knowledge for its occurrence in the food and feed chain.•  Pseudonocardia autotrophica is not recommended for the QPS list due to lack of body of knowledge and uncertainty on the safety of biologically active compounds which can be produced.•  Streptococcus salivarius is not recommended for the QPS list due to its ability to cause bacteraemia and systemic infection that results in a variety of morbidities.•  Papiliotrema terrestris is not recommended for the QPS list due to a limited body of knowledge.•  Ensifer adhaerens (synonym Sinorhizobium adhaerens) is not recommended for the QPS list due to lack of body of knowledge for its occurrence in the food and feed chain.•  Microbacterium foliorum is not recommended for the QPS list due to lack of body of knowledge for its occurrence in the food and feed chain.•  Pseudomonas fluorescens is not recommended for the QPS list due to possible safety concerns.

PMC9310698,Abstract,Abstract,AP008957,0,0,0,,,"  Abstract  The qualified presumption of safety (QPS) approach was developed to provide a regularly updated generic pre‐evaluation of the safety of microorganisms, intended for use in the food or feed chains, to support the work of EFSA's Scientific Panels. The QPS approach is based on an assessment of published data for each agent, with respect to its taxonomic identity, the body of relevant knowledge, safety concerns and occurrence of antimicrobial resistance. Safety concerns identified for a taxonomic unit (TU) are, where possible, confirmed at the species/strain or product level and reflected by ‘qualifications’. In the period covered by this statement, no new information was found that would change the status of previously recommended QPS TUs. Of the 50 microorganisms notified to EFSA in October 2021 to March 2022 (inclusive), 41 were not evaluated: 10 filamentous fungi, 1 Enterococcus faecium, 1 Clostridium butyricum, 3 Escherichia coli and 1 Streptomyces spp. because are excluded from QPS evaluation, and 25 TUs that have already a QPS status. Nine notifications, corresponding to seven TUs were evaluated: four of these, Streptococcus salivarius, Companilactobacillus formosensis, Pseudonocardia autotrophica and Papiliotrema terrestris, being evaluated for the first time. The other three, Microbacterium foliorum, Pseudomonas fluorescens and Ensifer adhaerens were re‐assessed. None of these TUs were recommended for QPS status: Ensifer adhaerens, Microbacterium foliorum, Companilactobacillus formosensis and Papiliotrema terrestris due to a limited body of knowledge, Streptococcus salivarius due to its ability to cause bacteraemia and systemic infection that results in a variety of morbidities, Pseudonocardia autotrophica due to lack of body of knowledge and uncertainty on the safety of biologically active compounds which can be produced, and Pseudomonas fluorescens due to possible safety concerns.

To complete the assessment an ELS‐based approach may have been applied. In the current Panel Statement, this ELS approach was applied for assessing the QPS status of Ensifer adhaerens and Streptococcus salivarius. The ELS followed the same methodology as used for monitoring new safety concerns related to species with QPS status. Details on the search strategy, search keys, and approach for each of the assessments of those 2 TU may be found below.

PMC9310698,Assessment,Other,AP008957,1,0,0,,,"  3  Assessment  The search strategy (key words, literature databases, number of papers found) followed for the assessment of the suitability of TUs notified to EFSA for their inclusion in the updated QPS list (reply to ToR 3) can be found in Appendix A.  3.1  Taxonomic units evaluated during the previous QPS mandate and re‐evaluated in the current statement  3.1.1  Bacteria  Ensifer adhaerens synonym Sinorhizobium adhaerens  A new evaluation of Ensifer adhaerens was made because an update was requested in relation to the new QPS mandate. E. adhaerens was not recommended for the QPS list in the previous assessment due to a lack of body of knowledge (EFSA, 2011).  Identity  E. adhaerens is a valid taxonomic unit. Sinorhizobium adhaerens is a synonym (Cassida, 1982; Willems et al., 2003). Sinorhizobium morelense (Wang et al., 2002) and Ensifer morelensis (Wang et al., 2013, Oren and Garrity, 2015) are previously used names without nomenclature validation. All synonyms were included in the literature searches.  Body of knowledge  The literature search was concentrated on papers since 2011. Ensifer adhaerens is a rhizosphere inhabiting bacterium with the ability to genetically transform several plants species (Rudder et al., 2014). E. adhaerens strains have been isolated in relation to N2 fixing (Katiyar et al., 2021), biosorption and biodegradation potential (Xu et al., 2016, Mesa et al., 2017), ligninolytic potential (Falade et al., 2017), exopolysaccharide production (Marques Alvarez et al., 2018), degradation of neonicotinoid insecticides (Sun et al., 2021, Zhao et al., 2021), vitamin B production (Thi Vu et al., 2013), mineral weathering capacity (Wang et al., 2016), alliinase production with antimicrobial activity (Yutani et al., 2011) and growth promotion potential (Zhumakayev et al., 2021).  Safety concerns  The safety of Vitamin B12, produced by a strain of E. adhaerens has been assessed by EFSA (EFSA FEEDAP Panel, 2020). WGS confirmed the absence of any known virulence gene and no toxic compounds are expected to be produced during fermentation. No other references addressed food safety issues.  Conclusion on a recommendation for QPS status  E. adhaerens (synonym Sinorhizobium adhaerens) is not recommended for the QPS list due to lack of body of knowledge for its occurrence in the food and feed chain.  Microbacterium foliorum  A new evaluation of Microbacterium foliorum was made because an update was requested in relation to the new QPS mandate. M. foliorum was not recommended for the QPS list due to lack of body of knowledge (EFSA BIOHAZ Panel, 2019b). In the period between 2019 and 2022, only one relevant article was found related to the safety of M. foliorum. Fu et al. (2021) studied the microbiological load of urban air dust by a metagenomic approach and found an association of M. foliorum with the occurrence of wheeze, rhinitis and rhinoconjunctivitis; a causal relationship was not investigated.  Conclusion on a recommendation for QPS status  M. foliorum is not to be recommended for the QPS list due to lack of body of knowledge for its occurrence in the food and feed chain.  Pseudomonas fluorescens  A new evaluation of Pseudomonas fluorescens was made because an update was requested in relation to the new QPS mandate. P. fluorescens was considered as unsuitable for QPS in 2016 and 2019 assessments because some strains raise safety concerns (EFSA BIOHAZ Panel, 2016, 2019a).  In recent years, it was recognised that many strains, reported to be P. fluorescens, are incorrectly identified (Morimoto et al., 2020). Moreover, several studies reporting safety concerns do not mention the method used for identification of the pathogen or used, only 16S rRNA sequence as identification tool which has been shown to be insufficiently discriminative.  Studies, based on correct identification of P. fluorescens, are lacking to clarify the possible safety concerns reported in relation to P. fluorescens.  Conclusion on a recommendation for QPS status  P. fluorescens is not recommended for the QPS list due to possible safety concerns.  3.2  Taxonomic units to be evaluated for the first time  3.2.1  Bacteria  Companilactobacillus formosensis previously known as Lactobacillus formosensis  Identity  Companilactobacillus formosensis is a bacterial species of heterofermentative Lactobacillaceae with standing in nomenclature (Chang et al., 2015; Zheng et al., 2020). It was originally described as Lactobacillus formosensis by Chang et al. (2015) and then assigned to the genus Companilactobacillus by Zheng et al. (2020).  Body of knowledge  Very limited information is available on the C. formosensis species, other than the taxonomical identification. The type strain of this species (strain S215) has the potential to be used as a sweet potato vine silage inoculant because of its ability to improve fermentability and aerobic stability (Mangwe et al., 2016).  Safety concerns  No information has been published.  Conclusion on a recommendation for QPS status  C. formosensis (previously known as Lactobacillus formosensis) is not recommended for the QPS list due to lack of body of knowledge for its occurrence in the food and feed chain.  Pseudonocardia autotrophica  Identity  P. autotrophica is a filamentous actinomycete that was initially classified into the genus Streptomyces (Takamiya and Tubaki, 1956) and later transferred to the genus Pseudonocardia (Warwick et al., 1994). It is a valid species with standing in Nomenclature.  Body of knowledge  P. autotrophica has been reported to produce an antifungal compound belonging to the tetraene‐family, nystatin‐like Pseudonocardia polyene A1 (NPP A1) (Lee et al., 2012; Han et al., 2019; Park et al., 2020). It is also used for the production of biosurfactants (Kuznetsov et al., 2020), and as a biocatalyst for the commercial production of a cytochrome P‐450 hydroxylase of vitamin D3 (Fujii et al., 2009).  Safety concerns  The genome sequences of two P. autotrophica isolates have been published (Grumaz et al., 2017; Yoshida et al., 2018) and, in addition, another two have been deposited in the data bases. A search done by the QPS WG for secondary metabolite gene‐clusters using the antiSmash platform (Blin et al., 2021) revealed a cluster corresponding to a nystatin‐like polyene in one of the strains, DSM 43083 (GenBank: MIFY01000001.1), similar to the one previously described in P. autotrophica KCTC9441 (GenBank: EU108007.1), whose characterisation revealed antifungal activity against Candida albicans (Kim et al., 2009). Additionally, over 10 clusters that encoded potential polyketides and non‐ribosomally synthesized peptides (NRP) related to known biologically active compounds were identified, albeit with different degrees of similarity to the original genomic sequences. Among them, a 100% similarity was found to an alkylresorcinol polyketide (Genbank: AP009493.1) and 72% and 45% to the NRPs heterobactin (GenBank: AP008957.1) and coelibactin (GenBank: AL645882.2) respectively. There is lack of information on the safety of these secondary metabolites.  Conclusion on a recommendation for QPS status  P. autotrophica is not recommended for the QPS list due to lack of body of knowledge and uncertainty on the safety of biologically active compounds which can be produced.  Streptococcus salivarius  Identity  Streptococcus salivarius is a species with standing in nomenclature (Farrow and Collins, 1984). During the period 1984–1995, the species S. salivarius included also S. thermophilus as a subspecies (S. salivarius subsp. thermophilus). Later studies based on 16S rRNA gene comparison showed that, although being closely related to S. salivarius, S. thermophilus is a different species (Kawamura et al., 1995; Pombert et al., 2009). Genome analyses confirmed this view (Delorme et al., 2015).  Body of knowledge  This species is a human and animal commensal. Some strains are used as oral probiotics to limit nasopharyngeal infections, as supported by several papers in peer‐reviewed journals (Zupancic et al., 2017; Wilcox et al., 2019). Recent scientific articles focus on the safety assessment of some of the probiotic strains (Li et al., 2021; Hale et al., 2022).  Safety concerns  S. salivarius is a common inhabitant of the oropharynx and, as such, has been associated with halitosis and caries (Sterer and Rosenberg, 2006; Gross et al., 2012). From this and other sources, it can result in bacteraemia (Corredoira et al., 2005; Molinaro et al., 2014; Akbulut et al., 2018), which can be followed by meningitis (Srinivasan et al., 2012), endocarditis (Knudtzen et al., 2015), peritoneal/gallbladder (Urade et al., 2018) and brain (Mandapat et al., 2011) abscesses and prosthesis‐associated infections (Olson et al., 2019) among other morbidities. These diseases were found in immunocompromised and immunocompetent patients.  Antimicrobial resistance  Transmissible resistances to macrolides, phenicols, penicillins and tetracyclines have been reported, their determinants being allocated to transposons, and other mobile and integrative genetic elements (Chaffanel et al., 2015; Palma et al., 2016).  Conclusion on a recommendation for QPS status  S. salivarius is not recommended for the QPS list due to its ability to cause bacteraemia and systemic infection that results in a variety of morbidities.  3.2.2  Yeasts  Papiliotrema terrestris synonym Cryptococcus terrestris  Identity  Papiliotrema terrestris is a basidiomycetous yeast belonging to the Tremellaceae in the subphylum Agaricomycotina. The genus Papiliotrema was first proposed in 2002 to accommodate the new species Papiliotrema bandonii (Sampaio et al., 2002), and it has been revised in 2015 by Liu et al. (2015). The species P. terrestris was described by Crestani et al. (2009) as Cryptococcus terrestris. It was ubiquitously found in the soil and the species has recently been reclassified as Papiliotrema terrestris (Miccoli et al., 2020; Li et al., 2020).  Body of knowledge  Since the species is rather recently described the body of knowledge is limited. Some strains of this species are proposed as biocontrol agents and the majority of the strains are isolated from plants, fruits and soil. The type strain CBS 101036 is patented under the name C. nodaensis to produce salt‐tolerant and thermostable glutaminase (US Patent US006063409A; Sato et al., 1999). Isolate CBS 942 (NRRL Y‐1401, cited as C. laurentii or C. laurentii var. flavescens) produces an acidic extracellular polysaccharide, which contains d‐xylose, d‐mannose, d‐glucuronic acid and O‐acetyl (Abercrombie et al., 1960; Slodki et al., 1966; De Baets and Vandamme, 2001, De Baets et al., 2002).  The complete genome sequence of the biocontrol yeast P. terrestris strain LS28P is available in GenBank.  Safety concerns  According to Crestani et al. (2009) and Kurtzman et al. (2011), P. terrestris is phylogenetically closely related to C. laurentii and C. flavescens (syn. C. laurentii) which has been associated with some infections (Kurtzman 2011; Intra et al., 2021; Zono et al., 2021).  Conclusion on a recommendation for QPS status  P. terrestris is not recommended for the QPS list due to a limited body of knowledge.  3.3  Monitoring of new safety concerns related to organisms on the QPS list  The summaries of the evaluation of the possible safety concerns for humans, animals or the environment described and published since the previous ELS exercise (i.e. articles published between July and December 2021 as described in Appendices B and C) with reference to the articles selected as potentially relevant for the QPS exercise (Appendix D) for each of the TUs or groups of TUs that are part of the QPS list (Appendix E), are presented below.  3.3.1  Gram‐positive non‐sporulating bacteria  Bifidobacterium spp.  A search for papers potentially relevant for QPS‐listed Bifidobacterium spp. provided 359 references. The AI analysis left 180. Title screening left 10 references for abstract screening, then 3 for a full article appraisal. This last step discarded two articles because no safety concern was found. One was found relevant (D'Agostin et al., 2021) but because it is a study review referring to articles that have been already part of previous ELS exercises, it was not further considered. Consequently, the QPS status of these species is not changed.  Carnobacterium divergens  A search for potentially relevant papers on C. divergens provided six references. No article was considered relevant at the level of title screening for this TU. Consequently, the QPS status of C. divergens is not changed.  Corynebacterium glutamicum  A search for papers potentially relevant to the QPS evaluation of C. glutamicum provided 23 references. Two papers reached the level of title and abstract screening and one reach full‐text evaluation but no new safety concerns were identified and the QPS status of C. glutamicum is not changed.  Lactobacilli  Analysis of papers referring to any of the QPS species, formerly belonging to the genus Lactobacillus and recently split into 13 new genera, provided 942 references. The AI analysis left 471 articles. Title screening of these provided 25 references for abstract screening, which further reduced their number to 7. Three of them did not raise safety concerns, one was on L. paragasseri, which is not a QPS organism, and the other three (Aydogan et al., 2021; Miwa et al., 2021; Pietrangelo et al., 2021) although relevant, were excluded because no reliable microorganism identification procedures were described, or due to uncertainty on the aetiology of the cases described. Moreover, the patients affected were a newborn baby that presented a congenital hypoplastic left heart syndrome, an 88‐year‐old lady with terminal pancreatitis and uncontrolled diabetes and a middle‐aged alcoholic man, i.e.: all of them presented serious morbidities that might have allowed the opportunistic infections described.  Based on the available evidence as described above, the status of any of the QPS species included in the group of lactobacilli is not changed.  Lactococcus lactis  A search for papers potentially relevant for the QPS status of L. lactis provided 213 references. The AI analysis left 110 papers. Title and abstract screenings reduced their numbers to 12 and 5, respectively. One of them did not raise safety concerns, another did not deal with L. lactis, and identification of the causal microorganism was not reliable for two of the remaining cases, only phenotypical methods were used (Ahmed et al., 2021; Gurley et al., 2021). The third (Rowe et al., 2021) was on comparison of different algorithms to predict occurrence of cow mastitis.  Based on the available evidence as described above, the QPS status of L. lactis is not changed.  Leuconostoc spp.  A search for papers potentially relevant for the QPS evaluation of Leuconostoc species provided 76 references. The analysis of their titles left five articles for title/abstract screening. Two articles reached full text evaluation, but neither dealt with possible safety concerns. Consequently, the status of QPS‐listed Leuconostoc spp. is not changed.  Microbacterium imperiale  A search for papers potentially relevant for the QPS evaluation of M. imperiale provided 1 reference but was not relevant for title/abstract screening. Consequently, the QPS status of M. imperiale is not changed.  Oenococcus oeni  A search for papers potentially relevant for the QPS evaluation of Oenococcus oeni provided 29 references. The analysis of their titles left no articles for title/abstract screening. Consequently, the QPS status of O. oeni is not changed.  Pediococcus spp.  A search for papers potentially relevant for the QPS evaluation of Pediococcus spp. provided 175 references. The analysis of their titles left two articles for the title/abstract phase. No article reached the full text evaluation stage, consequently, the status of QPS‐listed Pediococcus spp. is not changed.  Propionibacterium spp.  A search for papers potentially relevant for the QPS evaluation of Propionibacterium spp. provided 24 references. Following the analysis of their titles, no article was selected for abstract screening or the full article evaluation phase, consequently, the status of QPS‐listed Propionibacterium spp. is not changed.  Streptococcus thermophilus  A search for papers potentially relevant for the QPS evaluation of Streptococcus thermophilus provided 80 references. The analysis of their titles left 4 articles for title and abstract screening, which did not deal with safety concerns. Therefore, no article reached the evaluation phase, and the QPS status of S. thermophilus is not changed.  3.3.2  Gram‐positive spore‐forming bacteria  A search for papers potentially relevant for Bacillus spp. and Geobacillus stearothermophilus provided 1,416 references. The AI analysis left 676 articles. The analysis of their titles left 15 articles for the abstract phase and, from these, 9 articles passed to the full‐text phase for further analysis.  Bacillus spp.  All nine articles that passed to the full text phase for further analysis were related to Bacillus spp. Three papers did not deal with safety concerns. Six papers were further analysed. One paper (D'Agostin et al., 2021) reviewed human case reports related to probiotic intake of B. clausii which were already discussed in previous EFSA statements. Four papers had methodology problems related to the identification methodology used (Garcia et al., 2021; Severiche‐Bueno et al., 2021; Lampropoulos et al., 2021) and/or the source attribution (Konate et al., 2021; Severiche‐Bueno et al., 2021). Three papers described predisposing factors for the infection (Garcia et al., 2021; Konate et al., 2021; Lampropoulos et al., 2021). One paper (Liu et al., 2021) presented phylogenetic and phylogenomic results based on the genome sequences of 96 B. amyloliquefaciens strains from different sources, mentioning the presence of possible virulence genes in strains. For most of these genes there is no information of a direct link with the enhancement of the capacity to cause infection. One strain (MBGja9) was shown to carry genes from the isd cluster that were previously described to be connected with virulence of Staphylococcus sp. (Naushad et al., 2019). Publicly available genome (assembly number ASM291526v1) of this strain revealed an assembly anomaly, not allowing the confirmation of the linkage of these genes with B. amyloliquefaciens.  2  Through the ELS, the WG did not identify any information that would change the status of members of Bacillus spp. included in the QPS list.  Geobacillus stearothermophilus  None of the nine articles that passed to the full‐text phase for further analysis dealt with this species. Consequently, the QPS status of G. stearothermophilus is not changed.  Pasteuria nishizawae  A search for papers potentially relevant for the QPS evaluation of P. nishizawae provided 1 reference that did not reach the full text stage. Consequently, the QPS status of P. nishizawae is not changed.  3.3.3  Gram‐negative bacteria  A search for papers potentially relevant to the QPS evaluation of Gluconobacter oxidans, Xanthomonas campestris, Cupriavidus necator and Komagataeibacter sucrofermentans provided in total 260 references.  Cupriavidus necator  A search for papers potentially relevant for C. necator provided 73 references. The analysis of the titles left three papers, but none dealt with this species. Consequently, the QPS status of C. necator is not changed.  Gluconobacter oxydans  A search for papers potentially relevant for G. oxydans provided 32 references. The analysis of the titles left three papers, but none dealt with this species. Consequently, the QPS status of G. oxydans is not changed.  Komagataeibacter sucrofermentans  A search for papers potentially relevant for K. sucrofermentans provided 16 references. The analysis of the titles left three papers, but none dealt with this species. Consequently, the QPS status of K. sucrofermentans is not changed.  Xanthomonas campestris  A search for papers potentially relevant for X. campestris provided 139 references. The analysis of the titles left 3 articles, 1 reached the full‐text phase but no safety concern was identified. Consequently, the QPS status of X. campestris is not changed.  3.3.4  Yeasts  The ELS searches for potentially relevant studies on the yeasts with QPS status provided 1,613 references. The AI analysis left 802 articles. After title screening, 92 studies remained for the title/abstract phase, and from these 19 articles passed to the full article appraisal. All of these 19 reported a possible safety concern.  The 19 studies that discussed potentially relevant safety concerns for QPS yeast species are discussed below.  For the species   Candida cylindracea, Kluyveromyces lactis, Komagataella pastoris, Komagataella phaffi, Ogataea angusta, Saccharomyces bayanus, Saccharomyces pastorianus, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Xanthophyllomyces dendrorhous, Yarrowia lipolytica and Zygosaccharomyces rouxii,   no safety concerns were reported. Consequently, the QPS status does not change for these species.  Cyberlindnera jadinii  The anamorph name of C. jadinii is Candida utilis.  Three references related to possible concerns for human safety were identified by Mohzari (2021), Sreelekshmi et al. (2021) and Sharma and Chauhan (2020).  Mohzari et al. (2021) reported a case of nosocomial meningitis by C. jadinii and the bacterium Stenotrophomonas maltophilia in a patient that had been subject to neurosurgery. The yeast identification by MALDI‐TOF MS was not confirmed by molecular analyses.  In a retrospective study in a hospital in India (Sreelekshmi et al., 2021), three of the “Candida spp.” Blood culture isolates (1.5% of total Candida) were C. jadinii. Two patients were neonates and one a four‐day‐old baby. All three cases shared a risk factor of intensive care unit stay, but the sources of the infections were not known. Two of the patients responded well to treatment. One was first treated for meningitis (caused by unidentified Pseudomonas), but then developed endocarditis with blood cultures growing Staphylococcus aureus and C. jadinii.  Sharma and Chauhan (2020) report a case of osteomyelitis (bone infection) by C. jadinii in a 9‐month old boy, who was immunosuppressed. However, the species identification is uncertain since no information was provided about which methods were used.  The reports on C. jadinii did not add any new information that would change the current QPS status of this species.  Debaryomyces hansenii  The anamorph name of D. hansenii is Candida famata.  One reference related to possible concerns for human safety was identified. Sakamoto et al. (2021) reported that five (3.3%) of the ‘Candida’ isolates from the blood of hospitalised patients with underlying disease or other predisposing conditions in a hospital in Japan were D. hansenii. However, species identification was only by standard biochemical growth test and is therefore very uncertain.  The report on D. hansenii did not add any new information that would change the current QPS status of this species.  Hanseniaspora uvarum  The anamorph name of H. uvarum is Kloeckera apiculata.  One reference related to possible concerns for human safety was identified. Sanchez‐Cardenas et al. (2021) reported onychomycosis (nail infection) with H. uvarum in a woman with multiple sclerosis, but the species identification is not definite, since standard CHROMagar showed Candida glabrata and MALDI‐TOF MS suggested H. uvarum. No molecular confirmation was performed.  The report on H. uvarum did not add any new information that would change the current QPS status of this species.  Kluyveromyces marxianus  The anamorph name of K. marxianus is Candida kefyr.  Three publications contribute with information related to human safety concerns, and all three present identification problems (Singh et al., 2020; Jain et al., 2021,; Zyrek, 2021). Singh et al. (2020) claim that 2 clinical isolates from patients with suspected candidiasis in a hospital in India were Candida kefyr. Since the species identification is very uncertain and the paper lacks information regarding any predisposing conditions in the patients, the importance of the results cannot be appropriately assessed. Zyrek et al. (2021) provided no relevant information about this species.  The papers did not identify any information that would change the QPS status of K. marxianus.  Saccharomyces cerevisiae  The anamorph form of S. cerevisiae is not described. A synonym of this species is Saccharomyces boulardii.  Five publications reported safety concerns for humans and in four of them, the identification is uncertain. Four of them published fungaemia cases linked to the use of S. boulardii as a probiotic. Pinto et al., (2021) described a case of a fungal infection caused by S. cerevisiae in a critically ill COVID‐19 patient in an intensive care unit (ICU) after supplementation with Saccharomyces. Rannikko et al. (2021) also reported fungaemia cases linked to the use of S. boulardii probiotic in Finland hospitals from 2009 to 2018. Wombwell et al., (2021) report a retrospective study of 16.404 hospitalised patients in a medical care centre in the US. All subjects received S. boulardii as a preventative probiotic and were investigated for S. cerevisiae/S. boulardii in blood. Even though the subjects were hospitalised with underlying disease or trauma, and the majority of the patients admitted to intensive care had a central catheter, the fungaemia incidence was very low (0.1%). D'Agostin et al. (2021) make a systematic review of fungal infections due to intake of S. boulardii as a probiotic. Each of the 14 patients in the cited studies reporting infection with S. boulardii had underlying conditions.  Imre et al., (2021) compared the general phenotypic and virulence factors of 14 S. boulardii isolates, four from probiotic products and 10 clinical isolates, of which two were from patients diagnosed with mycosis. The authors conclude that some strains in probiotic products possess features that enable them to act as pathogens when conditions are permissive, and whether they can enter the bloodstream is mainly due to factors related to the host.  These new reports of S. cerevisiae did not add any new information that indicates change in the current QPS status of this species. The current QPS status of S. cerevisiae is not changed.  Wickerhamomyces anomalus  The anamorph name of W. anomalus is Candida pelliculosa.  Four references related to possible concerns for human safety were identified: Zhang et al. (2021), Yasuj et al. (2021), Koutserimpas et al. (2021), Yang (2021).  Zhang et al. (2021) reported 13 cases of W. anomalus fungaemia (positive blood cultures) in a 2.5‐year retrospective study in a hospital in China. Identification was by MALDI‐TOF MS but no further molecular confirmation was provided. All patients were hospitalised and had underlying disease and/or other predisposing conditions. There are uncertainties regarding W. anomalus as the etiological agent, since eight of the 13 subjects had mixed bacterial/Candida infection and four mixed candidemia. The isolates´ susceptibility to azoles were comparatively low and other classes of antimycotics were therefore recommended for treatment.  In a retrospective study in a hospital in Iran (2016–2019), blood samples were taken from 800 patients (Yasuj et al., 2021). One of the 27 with confirmed candidemia (in intensive care unit because of urinary tract infection with unknown agent) showed growth of W. anomalus. The isolate was susceptible to all tested antimycotics (fluconazole, amphotericin B and caspofungin).  Koutserimpas et al. (2021) reviewed reports of ‘non‐Candida’ opportunistic infections after prosthetic joint arthroplasty. Out of the 42 retrieved cases globally for the period 1981–2018, five were W. anomalus. A thorough evaluation of the implications of this review cannot be performed since no details are provided regarding identification methods.  W. anomalus has occasionally caused nosocomial outbreaks of opportunistic infections in neonatal intensive care units. Yang et al. (2021) provides two additional cases of fungaemia in 2012 and 2013 in a hospital in China. All isolates were susceptible to all five tested antimycotic substances and infections were successfully treated.  The literature update did not identify any information that would change the current QPS status of W. anomalus.  3.3.5  Protists  Aurantiochytrium limacinum  A search for papers potentially relevant for A. limacinum provided 22 articles. The analysis of their titles left 1 article, but this paper did not reach the full article evaluation stage, thus no new safety concern was identified. Therefore, the current QPS status of A. limacinum is not changed.  3.3.6  Algae  A search for papers potentially relevant for algae provided 240 articles. The analysis of their titles left 17 articles and for 4 of these the full text was analysed.  Euglena gracilis  No article dealt with potential safety concerns of E. gracilis. Therefore, the current QPS status of E. gracilis is not changed.  Haematococcus lacustris synonym Haematococcus pluvialis  No article dealt with potential safety concerns of H. lacustris. Therefore, the current QPS status of H. lacustris is not changed.  Tetraselmis chuii  No article dealt with potential safety concerns of T. chuii. Therefore, the current QPS status of T. chuii is not changed.  3.3.7  Viruses used for plant protection  Alphaflexiviridae and Potyviridae  A search for papers potentially relevant for the QPS evaluation of viruses of the Alphaflexiviridae and Potyviridae provided 55 references. After title screening, no paper reached the title/abstract screening stage, thus no new safety concern was identified. Therefore, the current QPS status remains unchanged.  Baculoviridae  A search for papers potentially relevant for the QPS evaluation of Baculoviridae provided 59 references. Two articles dealing with Baculoviridae passed the title screening but did not reach the full article evaluation stage, thus no new safety concern was identified. Therefore, the current QPS status remains unchanged.  ",TRUE,TRUE,

ToR 2: Review taxonomic units previously recommended for the QPS list and their qualifications when new information has become available:  •In relation to the results of the monitoring of possible new safety concerns relevant for the QPS list, there were no results that would justify removal of any TUs from the QPS list.  ToR 3: (Re)assess the suitability of taxonomic units notified to EFSA not present in the current QPS list for their inclusion in that list:  •Out of the 50 notifications received between October 2021 and March 2022, 25 were related to TUs that already had QPS status and therefore did not require further evaluation.•Of the remaining 25 notifications, 16 notifications were related to microorganisms that are excluded from QPS evaluation (10 were notifications of filamentous fungi, 1 of Clostridium butyricum (bacterium), 1 of Enterococcus faecium (bacterium), 3 of Escherichia coli (bacterium), 1 of Streptomyces sp. (bacterium).•Nine of the 50 notifications received, corresponding to 7 TUs, were evaluated for possible QPS status: four of these (Companilactobacillus formosensis, Pseudonocardia autotrophica, Streptococcus salivarius and Papiliotrema terrestris) being evaluated for the first time. The other three, Ensifer adhaerens, Microbacterium foliorum and Pseudomonas fluorescens were re‐assessed because an update was requested in relation to the current mandate. The following conclusions were drawn:  ○  Companilactobacillus formosensis (previously known as Lactobacillus formosensis) is not recommended for the QPS list due to lack of body of knowledge for its occurrence in the food and feed chain.○  Ensifer adhaerens (synonym Sinorhizobium adhaerens) is not recommended for the QPS list due to lack of body of knowledge for its occurrence in the food and feed chain.○  Microbacterium foliorum is not recommended for the QPS list due to lack of body of knowledge for its occurrence in the food and feed chain.○  Pseudonocardia autotrophica is not recommended for the QPS list due to lack of body of knowledge and uncertainty on the safety of biologically active compounds which can be produced.○  Pseudomonas fluorescens is not recommended for the QPS list due to possible safety concerns.○  Papiliotrema. terrestris is not recommended for the QPS list due to a limited body knowledge.○  Streptococcus salivarius is not recommended for the QPS list due to its ability to cause bacteraemia and systemic infection that results in a variety of morbidities.

The literature review considered the information on taxonomy, the body of knowledge, the potential safety concerns related to human and animal health and to the environment (EFSA BIOHAZ Panel, 2020a) for each TU. The environmental risk assessment of plant protection products is not included in the QPS assessment but is carried out by the Pesticide Peer Review (PPR) Unit based on the risk assessment in the application. Information on relevant acquired antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is reflected in the safety sections.  Relevant databases, such as PubMed, Web of Science, CAB Abstracts or Food Science Technology Abstracts (FSTA) and Scopus, were searched, based on the judgement of the experts. To complete the assessment an ELS‐based approach may have been applied. In the current Panel Statement, this ELS approach was applied for assessing the QPS status of Ensifer adhaerens and Streptococcus salivarius. The ELS followed the same methodology as used for monitoring new safety concerns related to species with QPS status. More details on the search strategy, search keys, and approach for each of the assessments are described in Appendix A. Only the literature that is considered, based on expert judgement, to be relevant for the QPS assessment is reflected in the Statement.  Only valid TUs covered by the relevant international committees on the nomenclature for microorganisms are considered for the QPS assessment.  2.2  Methodologies  2.2.1  Evaluation of a QPS recommendation for taxonomic units notified to EFSA  In response to ToR 1, the EFSA Units were asked to update the list of microbiological agents being notified to EFSA. A total of 50 notifications were received between October 2021 and March 2022, of which 35 were for evaluation for use in feed, 11 for use as food enzymes, food additives and flavourings, 4 as novel foods and 0 as plant protection products (Table 1).

(b)  Nine notifications corresponding to seven TUs, four of these (Companilactobacillus formosensis, Pseudonocardia autotrophica, Streptococcus salivarius, and Papiliotrema terrestris) being evaluated for the first time. The other three, Ensifer adhaerens, Microbacterium foliorum and Pseudomonas fluorescens were re‐assessed because an update was requested in the current mandate.  In response to ToR 3, nine of the 50 notifications, corresponding to seven TUs, were evaluated for possible QPS status, four of these, Companilactobacillus formosensis, Pseudonocardia autotrophica, Streptococcus salivarius, and Papiliotrema terrestris, being evaluated for the first time. The other three, Ensifer adhaerens, Microbacterium foliorum and Pseudomonas fluorescens, were re‐assessed because an update was requested in the current mandate. The remaining 41 notifications were excluded from QPS evaluation for the following reasons: 17 notifications were related to microorganisms that are excluded from QPS evaluation (10 were notifications of filamentous fungi, 1 of Clostridium butyricum (bacterium), 1 of Enterococcus faecium (bacterium), 3 of Escherichia coli, 1 Streptomyces spp.) and 25 were related to TUs that already had QPS status and did not require further evaluation in this mandate.  2.2.2  Monitoring of new safety concerns related to species with QPS status  In reply to ToR 2, concerning the revision of the TUs previously recommended for the QPS list and their qualifications, an extensive literature search (ELS) was conducted as described in Appendix B – ELS protocol, see https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3607188, and in Appendix C Search strategies – see https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3607192, respectively.  The artificial intelligence (AI) function of DistillerSR was used for pre‐screening of papers for Bifidobacterium spp., lactobacilli, Lactococcus lactis, Bacillus spp. and yeasts, followed by a second screening of those articles carried out by two experts.  The aim of the ELS was to identify any publicly available scientific studies reporting on safety concerns for humans, animals or the environment, caused by QPS organisms since the previous QPS review (i.e. publications from July to December 2021).  For case reports of human infections or intoxications, important additional information includes whether any negative impacts are confined to persons with conditions favouring opportunistic infections, for example immunosuppression, and whether transmission occurred through food or other routes, when described (e.g. medical devices). Studies indicating the presence of virulence factors (e.g. toxins and enzymes that may contribute to the pathogenicity of the microorganism) in the TU are also reported as relevant when identifying potential safety concerns.  Several of the QPS‐TUs are sporadically reported as causing infections in individuals with recognised predisposing conditions for the acquisition of opportunistic infections, e.g. cardiovascular conditions associated with endocarditis, people in the lower or upper age spectrum, or with other conditions which can lead to impairment of the immunological system, such as patients subjected to transplants, undergoing cancer therapy, suffering from physical trauma or tissue damage, or HIV patients. Moreover, gastrointestinal tract‐related conditions with, for example mucosal impairment and/or proton pump inhibitors can also be predisposing factors for infection. Previous use of the microorganisms being assessed as food supplements for humans was reported in many of these cases. Nevertheless, the QPS assessment takes into consideration these reports, extracting relevant information whenever justified. For a detailed protocol of the process and search strategies, refer to Appendices B and C.  After removal of duplicates, 3,290 records were submitted to the title screening step, which led to the exclusion of 3,143 of these. The remaining 190 records were found eligible for the title and abstract screening step, which led to the exclusion of 66 of these. Of the 55 articles that finally reached the article evaluation step (full text), 32 were considered to report a potential safety concern and were further analysed.  The flow of records from their identification by the different search strategies (as reported in Appendix C) to their consideration as potentially relevant papers for QPS is shown in Table 2.

PMC9310698,Introduction,Introduction,AP008957,0,0,0,,,"  1  Introduction  The qualified presumption of safety (QPS) approach was developed by the EFSA Scientific Committee to provide a generic concept for risk assessment within the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) for microorganisms intentionally introduced into the food chain, in support of the respective Scientific Panels and Units in the context of market authorisations for their use in food and feed and requiring an EFSA safety assessment (EFSA, 2007). The list, first established in 2007, has been continuously revised and updated. A Panel Statement is published approximately every 6 months. These Panel Statements include the results of the assessment of relevant new papers related to the TUs with QPS status. They also contain the assessment of newly submitted TUs to the EFSA Units on Feed, Food Ingredients and Packaging (FIP), Nutrition, Pesticides and Genetically Modified Organisms (GMO). After 3 years, a QPS opinion is published summarising the results of the Panel Statements published in that period.  1.1  Background and Terms of Reference as provided by EFSA  A wide variety of microorganisms are intentionally added at different stages of the food and feed chains. In the context of applications for market authorisation of these microbiological agents used, either directly or as sources of food and feed additives, food enzymes and plant protection products, EFSA is requested to assess their safety.  EFSA's work on QPS activities began in 2004 when the Scientific Committee issued a scientific opinion in continuation of the 2003 working document ‘On a generic approach to the safety assessment of microorganisms used in feed/food and feed/food production’ prepared by a working group consisting of members of the former Scientific Committee on Animal Nutrition, the Scientific Committee on Food and the Scientific Committee on Plants of the European Commission.  1   The document, made available for public consultation, proposed the introduction of the concept of Qualified Presumption of Safety (QPS), to be applied to selected groups of microorganisms. Microorganisms not considered suitable for QPS status would remain subject to a full safety assessment. EFSA management asked its Scientific Committee to consider whether the QPS approach could be applied to the safety assessment of microorganisms across the various EFSA Scientific Panels. In doing so, the Committee was required to take into account the response of the stakeholders to the QPS approach. In its 2005 opinion (EFSA, 2005), the Scientific Committee concluded that the QPS approach could provide a generic assessment system that could be applied to all requests received by EFSA for the safety assessments of microorganisms deliberately introduced into the food and feed chain. Its introduction was intended to improve transparency and ensure consistency in the approach used across the EFSA Panels. Applications involving a taxonomic unit belonging to a species that falls within a QPS group do not require a full safety assessment.  Several taxonomic units (usually species for bacteria and yeasts; families for viruses) have been included in the QPS list, either following notifications to EFSA, or proposals made initially by stakeholders during a public consultation in 2005, even if they were not yet notified to EFSA (EFSA, 2005). The EFSA Scientific Committee reviewed the range and numbers of microorganisms likely to be the subject of an EFSA Opinion and, in 2007, published a list of microorganisms recommended for the QPS list.  In their 2007 opinion (EFSA, 2007), the Scientific Committee recommended that a QPS approach should provide a generic concept to prioritise and to harmonise safety risk assessment of microorganisms intentionally introduced into the food chain, in support of the respective Scientific Panels and EFSA Units in the frame of the market authorisations for their use in the food and feed chain. The same Committee recognised that there would have to be continuing provision for reviewing and modifying the QPS list and, in line with this recommendation, the EFSA Panel on Biological Hazards (BIOHAZ) took the prime responsibility for this and started reviewing annually the existing QPS list. In 2008, the first annual QPS update was published (EFSA, 2008).  In 2014, the BIOHAZ Panel, in consultation with the Scientific Committee, decided to change the revision procedure; the overall assessment of the taxonomic units previously recommended for the QPS list (EFSA BIOHAZ Panel, 2013) was no longer carried out annually but over a 3‐year period. From 2017, the search and revision of the possible safety concerns linked to those taxonomic units began instead to be carried out every 6 months through extensive literature searches (ELS). The update of the 2013 QPS list (EFSA BIOHAZ Panel, 2013) was done in 2016 (EFSA BIOHAZ Panel, 2017). From 2016 on, the QPS list (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1146566) and the list of notifications to EFSA (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3607183) are constantly updated, independent of the QPS opinion, and are available at the Knowledge Junction in Zenodo. The most recent QPS opinion (EFSA BIOHAZ Panel, 2020a) summarises the main results of the 3‐year ELS on the QPS TUs, together with an update of the process for granting QPS status. In the meantime, every 6 months a Panel Statement, compiling the assessments for a QPS status of the microbiological agents notified to EFSA requested by the Feed Unit, the Food Ingredients and Packaging (FIP) Unit, the Nutrition Unit, the Pesticides Unit and the Genetically Modified Organisms (GMO) Unit, as well as the summary of each 6‐month ELS exercise, has been produced and published. Each QPS Panel Statement contains the evaluations of the new notifications for microorganisms submitted for possible QPS status. It also contains the result of a standardised extensive literature search performed every 6 months regarding possible new safety concerns related to the TUs already included in the QPS list. The data identified are used to inform decisions on whether any TU may or may not remain on the QPS list, and whether any qualifications need to be revised.  Establishing a QPS status is based on four pillars: [1] the taxonomic grouping (TU) for which QPS is sought (‘taxonomic identification’); [2] whether sufficient relevant information is available about the proposed group of organisms to conclude on human/animal exposure via food/ feed (‘body of knowledge’); [3] whether the grouping proposed contains known ‘safety concerns’ and, finally, [4] the intended end use (‘intended use’). If a hazard related to a TU is identified, which can be tested at the strain or product level, a ‘qualification’ to exclude that hazard may be established and added. The subject of these qualifications for the microbial strain under investigation is evaluated by the EFSA Unit to which the application dossier has been allocated. Absence of acquired genes coding for resistance to antimicrobials relevant for humans and animals is a generic qualification for all bacterial TUs; the absence of antimycotic resistance should be proven if the pertinent yeasts are to be used as viable organisms in the food or feed chains. The qualification ‘for production purpose only’ implies the absence of viable cells of the production organism in the final product and can also be applied to food and feed products based on microbial biomass (EFSA BIOHAZ Panel, 2020a).  Because the QPS evaluation is, after its initial creation, only triggered through an application dossier notified to EFSA, the QPS list is not exhaustive.  In summary, the QPS evaluation provides a generic safety pre‐assessment approach for use within EFSA that covers safety concerns for humans, animals and the environment. In the QPS concept, a safety assessment of a defined taxonomic unit is performed independently of the legal framework under which the application is made in the course of an authorisation process. Although general human safety is part of the evaluation, specific issues relating to type and level of exposure of users handling the product (e.g. dermal contact, inhalation, ingestion) are not addressed. In the case of Genetically Modified Microorganisms (GMM) for which the species of the recipient strain qualifies for the QPS status, and for which the genetically modified state does not give rise to safety concerns, the QPS approach can be extended to genetically modified production strains (EFSA BIOHAZ Panel, 2018). The assessment of potential allergenic microbial residual components is beyond the QPS remit; however, if there is science‐based evidence for a microbial species it is reported. These aspects are separately assessed, where applicable, by the EFSA Panel responsible for assessing the application.  The lowest TU for which the QPS status is granted is the species level for bacteria, yeasts and protists/algae, and family for viruses.  Filamentous fungi, bacteriophages, Streptomycetes, Oomycetes, Enterococcus faecium, Escherichia coli and recently also Clostridium butyricum (EFSA BIOHAZ Panel, 2020a,b) are excluded from the QPS assessments based on an ambiguous taxonomic position or the possession of potentially harmful traits by some strains of the taxonomic unit, therefore requiring a specific assessment for each strain for which an application is made.  The Terms of Reference are as follows:  ToR 1: Keep updated the list of microbiological agents being notified in the context of a technical dossier to EFSA Units such as Feed, Pesticides, Food Ingredients and Packaging (FIP) and Nutrition, for intentional use directly or as sources of food and feed additives, food enzymes and plant protection products for safety assessment.  ToR 2: Review taxonomic units previously recommended for the QPS list and their qualifications when new information has become available. The latter is based on a review of the updated literature aiming to verify whether any new safety concern has arisen that could require the removal of a taxonomic unit from the list, and to verify if the qualifications still effectively exclude safety concerns.  ToR 3: (Re) assess the suitability of new taxonomic units notified to EFSA for their inclusion in the QPS list. These microbiological agents are notified to EFSA and requested by the Feed Unit, the FIP Unit, the Nutrition Unit or by the Pesticides Unit.  ",FALSE,TRUE,

PMC9310698,Summary,Other,AP008957,0,0,0,,,"  Summary  The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) asked the Panel on Biological Hazards (BIOHAZ) to deliver a Scientific Opinion on the maintenance of the qualified presumption of safety (QPS) list. The QPS list contains microorganisms, intentionally added to food and feed, which have achieved QPS status. The request included three specific tasks as mentioned in the Terms of Reference (ToRs).  The QPS process was developed to provide a harmonised generic pre‐evaluation procedure to support safety risk assessments of microorganisms performed by EFSA’s scientific Panels and Units. This process assesses the taxonomic identity, body of relevant knowledge and safety of microorganisms. Safety concerns identified for a taxonomic unit (TU) are, where possible, confirmed at strain or product level, reflected as ‘qualifications’ that should be assessed at the strain level by EFSA’s Scientific Panels. A generic qualification for all QPS bacterial TUs applies in relation to the absence of acquired genes conferring resistance to clinically relevant antimicrobials (EFSA, 2008).  The list of microorganisms is maintained and re‐evaluated approximately every 6 months in a Panel Statement. The Panel Statement also includes the evaluation of microbiological agents newly notified to EFSA within the previous 6‐month period.  The first ToR requires ongoing updates of the list of microbiological agents notified to EFSA, in the context of a technical dossier for safety assessment. The overall list (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3607183) was updated with the notifications received between October 2021 and March 2022. Within this period, 50 notifications were received by EFSA, of which 35 were proposed for evaluation in feed, 11 for use as food enzymes, food additives and flavourings and 4 as novel foods. The new notifications received between October 2021 and March 2022 are included in the current Statement (see Appendix F).  The second ToR concerns the revision of the TUs previously recommended for the QPS list and their qualifications. For this revision, articles published from July and December 2021 were assessed. The articles were retrieved and assessed through an extensive literature search (ELS) protocol available in Appendix B (see https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3607188) and the search strategies in Appendix C (see https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3607192). No new information was found that would affect the QPS status of those TUs or their qualifications.  The third ToR requires a (re)assessment of new TUs notified to EFSA, for their suitability for inclusion in the updated QPS list at the Knowledge Junction in Zenodo (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1146566, Appendix E – the link opens at the latest version of the QPS list, and also shows the versions associated to each Panel Statement).  Fifty notifications were received; 41 of these were not evaluated for the following reasons: 16 notifications were related to microorganisms that are excluded from QPS evaluation (10 were notifications of filamentous fungi, 1 Enterococcus faecium, 1 of Clostridium butyricum, 3 of Escherichia coli, 1 Streptomyces spp.), and 25 were related to TUs that already have QPS status and did not require further evaluation.  The remaining nine notifications, corresponding to seven TUs, were evaluated for possible QPS status: four of these (Companilactobacillus formosensis, Pseudonocardia autotrophica, Streptococcus salivarius and Papiliotrema terrestris) being evaluated for the first time. The other three, Ensifer adhaerens, Microbacterium foliorum and Pseudomonas fluorescens were re‐assessed because an update was requested in relation to the current mandate.  The following conclusions were drawn:  •  Companilactobacillus formosensis (previously known as Lactobacillus formosensis) is not recommended for the QPS list due to lack of body of knowledge for its occurrence in the food and feed chain.•  Pseudonocardia autotrophica is not recommended for the QPS list due to lack of body of knowledge and uncertainty on the safety of biologically active compounds which can be produced.•  Streptococcus salivarius is not recommended for the QPS list due to its ability to cause bacteraemia and systemic infection that results in a variety of morbidities.•  Papiliotrema terrestris is not recommended for the QPS list due to a limited body of knowledge.•  Ensifer adhaerens (synonym Sinorhizobium adhaerens) is not recommended for the QPS list due to lack of body of knowledge for its occurrence in the food and feed chain.•  Microbacterium foliorum is not recommended for the QPS list due to lack of body of knowledge for its occurrence in the food and feed chain.•  Pseudomonas fluorescens is not recommended for the QPS list due to possible safety concerns.

PMC9310698,Abstract,Abstract,AP009493,0,0,0,,,"  Abstract  The qualified presumption of safety (QPS) approach was developed to provide a regularly updated generic pre‐evaluation of the safety of microorganisms, intended for use in the food or feed chains, to support the work of EFSA's Scientific Panels. The QPS approach is based on an assessment of published data for each agent, with respect to its taxonomic identity, the body of relevant knowledge, safety concerns and occurrence of antimicrobial resistance. Safety concerns identified for a taxonomic unit (TU) are, where possible, confirmed at the species/strain or product level and reflected by ‘qualifications’. In the period covered by this statement, no new information was found that would change the status of previously recommended QPS TUs. Of the 50 microorganisms notified to EFSA in October 2021 to March 2022 (inclusive), 41 were not evaluated: 10 filamentous fungi, 1 Enterococcus faecium, 1 Clostridium butyricum, 3 Escherichia coli and 1 Streptomyces spp. because are excluded from QPS evaluation, and 25 TUs that have already a QPS status. Nine notifications, corresponding to seven TUs were evaluated: four of these, Streptococcus salivarius, Companilactobacillus formosensis, Pseudonocardia autotrophica and Papiliotrema terrestris, being evaluated for the first time. The other three, Microbacterium foliorum, Pseudomonas fluorescens and Ensifer adhaerens were re‐assessed. None of these TUs were recommended for QPS status: Ensifer adhaerens, Microbacterium foliorum, Companilactobacillus formosensis and Papiliotrema terrestris due to a limited body of knowledge, Streptococcus salivarius due to its ability to cause bacteraemia and systemic infection that results in a variety of morbidities, Pseudonocardia autotrophica due to lack of body of knowledge and uncertainty on the safety of biologically active compounds which can be produced, and Pseudomonas fluorescens due to possible safety concerns.

To complete the assessment an ELS‐based approach may have been applied. In the current Panel Statement, this ELS approach was applied for assessing the QPS status of Ensifer adhaerens and Streptococcus salivarius. The ELS followed the same methodology as used for monitoring new safety concerns related to species with QPS status. Details on the search strategy, search keys, and approach for each of the assessments of those 2 TU may be found below.

PMC9310698,Assessment,Other,AP009493,1,0,0,,,"  3  Assessment  The search strategy (key words, literature databases, number of papers found) followed for the assessment of the suitability of TUs notified to EFSA for their inclusion in the updated QPS list (reply to ToR 3) can be found in Appendix A.  3.1  Taxonomic units evaluated during the previous QPS mandate and re‐evaluated in the current statement  3.1.1  Bacteria  Ensifer adhaerens synonym Sinorhizobium adhaerens  A new evaluation of Ensifer adhaerens was made because an update was requested in relation to the new QPS mandate. E. adhaerens was not recommended for the QPS list in the previous assessment due to a lack of body of knowledge (EFSA, 2011).  Identity  E. adhaerens is a valid taxonomic unit. Sinorhizobium adhaerens is a synonym (Cassida, 1982; Willems et al., 2003). Sinorhizobium morelense (Wang et al., 2002) and Ensifer morelensis (Wang et al., 2013, Oren and Garrity, 2015) are previously used names without nomenclature validation. All synonyms were included in the literature searches.  Body of knowledge  The literature search was concentrated on papers since 2011. Ensifer adhaerens is a rhizosphere inhabiting bacterium with the ability to genetically transform several plants species (Rudder et al., 2014). E. adhaerens strains have been isolated in relation to N2 fixing (Katiyar et al., 2021), biosorption and biodegradation potential (Xu et al., 2016, Mesa et al., 2017), ligninolytic potential (Falade et al., 2017), exopolysaccharide production (Marques Alvarez et al., 2018), degradation of neonicotinoid insecticides (Sun et al., 2021, Zhao et al., 2021), vitamin B production (Thi Vu et al., 2013), mineral weathering capacity (Wang et al., 2016), alliinase production with antimicrobial activity (Yutani et al., 2011) and growth promotion potential (Zhumakayev et al., 2021).  Safety concerns  The safety of Vitamin B12, produced by a strain of E. adhaerens has been assessed by EFSA (EFSA FEEDAP Panel, 2020). WGS confirmed the absence of any known virulence gene and no toxic compounds are expected to be produced during fermentation. No other references addressed food safety issues.  Conclusion on a recommendation for QPS status  E. adhaerens (synonym Sinorhizobium adhaerens) is not recommended for the QPS list due to lack of body of knowledge for its occurrence in the food and feed chain.  Microbacterium foliorum  A new evaluation of Microbacterium foliorum was made because an update was requested in relation to the new QPS mandate. M. foliorum was not recommended for the QPS list due to lack of body of knowledge (EFSA BIOHAZ Panel, 2019b). In the period between 2019 and 2022, only one relevant article was found related to the safety of M. foliorum. Fu et al. (2021) studied the microbiological load of urban air dust by a metagenomic approach and found an association of M. foliorum with the occurrence of wheeze, rhinitis and rhinoconjunctivitis; a causal relationship was not investigated.  Conclusion on a recommendation for QPS status  M. foliorum is not to be recommended for the QPS list due to lack of body of knowledge for its occurrence in the food and feed chain.  Pseudomonas fluorescens  A new evaluation of Pseudomonas fluorescens was made because an update was requested in relation to the new QPS mandate. P. fluorescens was considered as unsuitable for QPS in 2016 and 2019 assessments because some strains raise safety concerns (EFSA BIOHAZ Panel, 2016, 2019a).  In recent years, it was recognised that many strains, reported to be P. fluorescens, are incorrectly identified (Morimoto et al., 2020). Moreover, several studies reporting safety concerns do not mention the method used for identification of the pathogen or used, only 16S rRNA sequence as identification tool which has been shown to be insufficiently discriminative.  Studies, based on correct identification of P. fluorescens, are lacking to clarify the possible safety concerns reported in relation to P. fluorescens.  Conclusion on a recommendation for QPS status  P. fluorescens is not recommended for the QPS list due to possible safety concerns.  3.2  Taxonomic units to be evaluated for the first time  3.2.1  Bacteria  Companilactobacillus formosensis previously known as Lactobacillus formosensis  Identity  Companilactobacillus formosensis is a bacterial species of heterofermentative Lactobacillaceae with standing in nomenclature (Chang et al., 2015; Zheng et al., 2020). It was originally described as Lactobacillus formosensis by Chang et al. (2015) and then assigned to the genus Companilactobacillus by Zheng et al. (2020).  Body of knowledge  Very limited information is available on the C. formosensis species, other than the taxonomical identification. The type strain of this species (strain S215) has the potential to be used as a sweet potato vine silage inoculant because of its ability to improve fermentability and aerobic stability (Mangwe et al., 2016).  Safety concerns  No information has been published.  Conclusion on a recommendation for QPS status  C. formosensis (previously known as Lactobacillus formosensis) is not recommended for the QPS list due to lack of body of knowledge for its occurrence in the food and feed chain.  Pseudonocardia autotrophica  Identity  P. autotrophica is a filamentous actinomycete that was initially classified into the genus Streptomyces (Takamiya and Tubaki, 1956) and later transferred to the genus Pseudonocardia (Warwick et al., 1994). It is a valid species with standing in Nomenclature.  Body of knowledge  P. autotrophica has been reported to produce an antifungal compound belonging to the tetraene‐family, nystatin‐like Pseudonocardia polyene A1 (NPP A1) (Lee et al., 2012; Han et al., 2019; Park et al., 2020). It is also used for the production of biosurfactants (Kuznetsov et al., 2020), and as a biocatalyst for the commercial production of a cytochrome P‐450 hydroxylase of vitamin D3 (Fujii et al., 2009).  Safety concerns  The genome sequences of two P. autotrophica isolates have been published (Grumaz et al., 2017; Yoshida et al., 2018) and, in addition, another two have been deposited in the data bases. A search done by the QPS WG for secondary metabolite gene‐clusters using the antiSmash platform (Blin et al., 2021) revealed a cluster corresponding to a nystatin‐like polyene in one of the strains, DSM 43083 (GenBank: MIFY01000001.1), similar to the one previously described in P. autotrophica KCTC9441 (GenBank: EU108007.1), whose characterisation revealed antifungal activity against Candida albicans (Kim et al., 2009). Additionally, over 10 clusters that encoded potential polyketides and non‐ribosomally synthesized peptides (NRP) related to known biologically active compounds were identified, albeit with different degrees of similarity to the original genomic sequences. Among them, a 100% similarity was found to an alkylresorcinol polyketide (Genbank: AP009493.1) and 72% and 45% to the NRPs heterobactin (GenBank: AP008957.1) and coelibactin (GenBank: AL645882.2) respectively. There is lack of information on the safety of these secondary metabolites.  Conclusion on a recommendation for QPS status  P. autotrophica is not recommended for the QPS list due to lack of body of knowledge and uncertainty on the safety of biologically active compounds which can be produced.  Streptococcus salivarius  Identity  Streptococcus salivarius is a species with standing in nomenclature (Farrow and Collins, 1984). During the period 1984–1995, the species S. salivarius included also S. thermophilus as a subspecies (S. salivarius subsp. thermophilus). Later studies based on 16S rRNA gene comparison showed that, although being closely related to S. salivarius, S. thermophilus is a different species (Kawamura et al., 1995; Pombert et al., 2009). Genome analyses confirmed this view (Delorme et al., 2015).  Body of knowledge  This species is a human and animal commensal. Some strains are used as oral probiotics to limit nasopharyngeal infections, as supported by several papers in peer‐reviewed journals (Zupancic et al., 2017; Wilcox et al., 2019). Recent scientific articles focus on the safety assessment of some of the probiotic strains (Li et al., 2021; Hale et al., 2022).  Safety concerns  S. salivarius is a common inhabitant of the oropharynx and, as such, has been associated with halitosis and caries (Sterer and Rosenberg, 2006; Gross et al., 2012). From this and other sources, it can result in bacteraemia (Corredoira et al., 2005; Molinaro et al., 2014; Akbulut et al., 2018), which can be followed by meningitis (Srinivasan et al., 2012), endocarditis (Knudtzen et al., 2015), peritoneal/gallbladder (Urade et al., 2018) and brain (Mandapat et al., 2011) abscesses and prosthesis‐associated infections (Olson et al., 2019) among other morbidities. These diseases were found in immunocompromised and immunocompetent patients.  Antimicrobial resistance  Transmissible resistances to macrolides, phenicols, penicillins and tetracyclines have been reported, their determinants being allocated to transposons, and other mobile and integrative genetic elements (Chaffanel et al., 2015; Palma et al., 2016).  Conclusion on a recommendation for QPS status  S. salivarius is not recommended for the QPS list due to its ability to cause bacteraemia and systemic infection that results in a variety of morbidities.  3.2.2  Yeasts  Papiliotrema terrestris synonym Cryptococcus terrestris  Identity  Papiliotrema terrestris is a basidiomycetous yeast belonging to the Tremellaceae in the subphylum Agaricomycotina. The genus Papiliotrema was first proposed in 2002 to accommodate the new species Papiliotrema bandonii (Sampaio et al., 2002), and it has been revised in 2015 by Liu et al. (2015). The species P. terrestris was described by Crestani et al. (2009) as Cryptococcus terrestris. It was ubiquitously found in the soil and the species has recently been reclassified as Papiliotrema terrestris (Miccoli et al., 2020; Li et al., 2020).  Body of knowledge  Since the species is rather recently described the body of knowledge is limited. Some strains of this species are proposed as biocontrol agents and the majority of the strains are isolated from plants, fruits and soil. The type strain CBS 101036 is patented under the name C. nodaensis to produce salt‐tolerant and thermostable glutaminase (US Patent US006063409A; Sato et al., 1999). Isolate CBS 942 (NRRL Y‐1401, cited as C. laurentii or C. laurentii var. flavescens) produces an acidic extracellular polysaccharide, which contains d‐xylose, d‐mannose, d‐glucuronic acid and O‐acetyl (Abercrombie et al., 1960; Slodki et al., 1966; De Baets and Vandamme, 2001, De Baets et al., 2002).  The complete genome sequence of the biocontrol yeast P. terrestris strain LS28P is available in GenBank.  Safety concerns  According to Crestani et al. (2009) and Kurtzman et al. (2011), P. terrestris is phylogenetically closely related to C. laurentii and C. flavescens (syn. C. laurentii) which has been associated with some infections (Kurtzman 2011; Intra et al., 2021; Zono et al., 2021).  Conclusion on a recommendation for QPS status  P. terrestris is not recommended for the QPS list due to a limited body of knowledge.  3.3  Monitoring of new safety concerns related to organisms on the QPS list  The summaries of the evaluation of the possible safety concerns for humans, animals or the environment described and published since the previous ELS exercise (i.e. articles published between July and December 2021 as described in Appendices B and C) with reference to the articles selected as potentially relevant for the QPS exercise (Appendix D) for each of the TUs or groups of TUs that are part of the QPS list (Appendix E), are presented below.  3.3.1  Gram‐positive non‐sporulating bacteria  Bifidobacterium spp.  A search for papers potentially relevant for QPS‐listed Bifidobacterium spp. provided 359 references. The AI analysis left 180. Title screening left 10 references for abstract screening, then 3 for a full article appraisal. This last step discarded two articles because no safety concern was found. One was found relevant (D'Agostin et al., 2021) but because it is a study review referring to articles that have been already part of previous ELS exercises, it was not further considered. Consequently, the QPS status of these species is not changed.  Carnobacterium divergens  A search for potentially relevant papers on C. divergens provided six references. No article was considered relevant at the level of title screening for this TU. Consequently, the QPS status of C. divergens is not changed.  Corynebacterium glutamicum  A search for papers potentially relevant to the QPS evaluation of C. glutamicum provided 23 references. Two papers reached the level of title and abstract screening and one reach full‐text evaluation but no new safety concerns were identified and the QPS status of C. glutamicum is not changed.  Lactobacilli  Analysis of papers referring to any of the QPS species, formerly belonging to the genus Lactobacillus and recently split into 13 new genera, provided 942 references. The AI analysis left 471 articles. Title screening of these provided 25 references for abstract screening, which further reduced their number to 7. Three of them did not raise safety concerns, one was on L. paragasseri, which is not a QPS organism, and the other three (Aydogan et al., 2021; Miwa et al., 2021; Pietrangelo et al., 2021) although relevant, were excluded because no reliable microorganism identification procedures were described, or due to uncertainty on the aetiology of the cases described. Moreover, the patients affected were a newborn baby that presented a congenital hypoplastic left heart syndrome, an 88‐year‐old lady with terminal pancreatitis and uncontrolled diabetes and a middle‐aged alcoholic man, i.e.: all of them presented serious morbidities that might have allowed the opportunistic infections described.  Based on the available evidence as described above, the status of any of the QPS species included in the group of lactobacilli is not changed.  Lactococcus lactis  A search for papers potentially relevant for the QPS status of L. lactis provided 213 references. The AI analysis left 110 papers. Title and abstract screenings reduced their numbers to 12 and 5, respectively. One of them did not raise safety concerns, another did not deal with L. lactis, and identification of the causal microorganism was not reliable for two of the remaining cases, only phenotypical methods were used (Ahmed et al., 2021; Gurley et al., 2021). The third (Rowe et al., 2021) was on comparison of different algorithms to predict occurrence of cow mastitis.  Based on the available evidence as described above, the QPS status of L. lactis is not changed.  Leuconostoc spp.  A search for papers potentially relevant for the QPS evaluation of Leuconostoc species provided 76 references. The analysis of their titles left five articles for title/abstract screening. Two articles reached full text evaluation, but neither dealt with possible safety concerns. Consequently, the status of QPS‐listed Leuconostoc spp. is not changed.  Microbacterium imperiale  A search for papers potentially relevant for the QPS evaluation of M. imperiale provided 1 reference but was not relevant for title/abstract screening. Consequently, the QPS status of M. imperiale is not changed.  Oenococcus oeni  A search for papers potentially relevant for the QPS evaluation of Oenococcus oeni provided 29 references. The analysis of their titles left no articles for title/abstract screening. Consequently, the QPS status of O. oeni is not changed.  Pediococcus spp.  A search for papers potentially relevant for the QPS evaluation of Pediococcus spp. provided 175 references. The analysis of their titles left two articles for the title/abstract phase. No article reached the full text evaluation stage, consequently, the status of QPS‐listed Pediococcus spp. is not changed.  Propionibacterium spp.  A search for papers potentially relevant for the QPS evaluation of Propionibacterium spp. provided 24 references. Following the analysis of their titles, no article was selected for abstract screening or the full article evaluation phase, consequently, the status of QPS‐listed Propionibacterium spp. is not changed.  Streptococcus thermophilus  A search for papers potentially relevant for the QPS evaluation of Streptococcus thermophilus provided 80 references. The analysis of their titles left 4 articles for title and abstract screening, which did not deal with safety concerns. Therefore, no article reached the evaluation phase, and the QPS status of S. thermophilus is not changed.  3.3.2  Gram‐positive spore‐forming bacteria  A search for papers potentially relevant for Bacillus spp. and Geobacillus stearothermophilus provided 1,416 references. The AI analysis left 676 articles. The analysis of their titles left 15 articles for the abstract phase and, from these, 9 articles passed to the full‐text phase for further analysis.  Bacillus spp.  All nine articles that passed to the full text phase for further analysis were related to Bacillus spp. Three papers did not deal with safety concerns. Six papers were further analysed. One paper (D'Agostin et al., 2021) reviewed human case reports related to probiotic intake of B. clausii which were already discussed in previous EFSA statements. Four papers had methodology problems related to the identification methodology used (Garcia et al., 2021; Severiche‐Bueno et al., 2021; Lampropoulos et al., 2021) and/or the source attribution (Konate et al., 2021; Severiche‐Bueno et al., 2021). Three papers described predisposing factors for the infection (Garcia et al., 2021; Konate et al., 2021; Lampropoulos et al., 2021). One paper (Liu et al., 2021) presented phylogenetic and phylogenomic results based on the genome sequences of 96 B. amyloliquefaciens strains from different sources, mentioning the presence of possible virulence genes in strains. For most of these genes there is no information of a direct link with the enhancement of the capacity to cause infection. One strain (MBGja9) was shown to carry genes from the isd cluster that were previously described to be connected with virulence of Staphylococcus sp. (Naushad et al., 2019). Publicly available genome (assembly number ASM291526v1) of this strain revealed an assembly anomaly, not allowing the confirmation of the linkage of these genes with B. amyloliquefaciens.  2  Through the ELS, the WG did not identify any information that would change the status of members of Bacillus spp. included in the QPS list.  Geobacillus stearothermophilus  None of the nine articles that passed to the full‐text phase for further analysis dealt with this species. Consequently, the QPS status of G. stearothermophilus is not changed.  Pasteuria nishizawae  A search for papers potentially relevant for the QPS evaluation of P. nishizawae provided 1 reference that did not reach the full text stage. Consequently, the QPS status of P. nishizawae is not changed.  3.3.3  Gram‐negative bacteria  A search for papers potentially relevant to the QPS evaluation of Gluconobacter oxidans, Xanthomonas campestris, Cupriavidus necator and Komagataeibacter sucrofermentans provided in total 260 references.  Cupriavidus necator  A search for papers potentially relevant for C. necator provided 73 references. The analysis of the titles left three papers, but none dealt with this species. Consequently, the QPS status of C. necator is not changed.  Gluconobacter oxydans  A search for papers potentially relevant for G. oxydans provided 32 references. The analysis of the titles left three papers, but none dealt with this species. Consequently, the QPS status of G. oxydans is not changed.  Komagataeibacter sucrofermentans  A search for papers potentially relevant for K. sucrofermentans provided 16 references. The analysis of the titles left three papers, but none dealt with this species. Consequently, the QPS status of K. sucrofermentans is not changed.  Xanthomonas campestris  A search for papers potentially relevant for X. campestris provided 139 references. The analysis of the titles left 3 articles, 1 reached the full‐text phase but no safety concern was identified. Consequently, the QPS status of X. campestris is not changed.  3.3.4  Yeasts  The ELS searches for potentially relevant studies on the yeasts with QPS status provided 1,613 references. The AI analysis left 802 articles. After title screening, 92 studies remained for the title/abstract phase, and from these 19 articles passed to the full article appraisal. All of these 19 reported a possible safety concern.  The 19 studies that discussed potentially relevant safety concerns for QPS yeast species are discussed below.  For the species   Candida cylindracea, Kluyveromyces lactis, Komagataella pastoris, Komagataella phaffi, Ogataea angusta, Saccharomyces bayanus, Saccharomyces pastorianus, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Xanthophyllomyces dendrorhous, Yarrowia lipolytica and Zygosaccharomyces rouxii,   no safety concerns were reported. Consequently, the QPS status does not change for these species.  Cyberlindnera jadinii  The anamorph name of C. jadinii is Candida utilis.  Three references related to possible concerns for human safety were identified by Mohzari (2021), Sreelekshmi et al. (2021) and Sharma and Chauhan (2020).  Mohzari et al. (2021) reported a case of nosocomial meningitis by C. jadinii and the bacterium Stenotrophomonas maltophilia in a patient that had been subject to neurosurgery. The yeast identification by MALDI‐TOF MS was not confirmed by molecular analyses.  In a retrospective study in a hospital in India (Sreelekshmi et al., 2021), three of the “Candida spp.” Blood culture isolates (1.5% of total Candida) were C. jadinii. Two patients were neonates and one a four‐day‐old baby. All three cases shared a risk factor of intensive care unit stay, but the sources of the infections were not known. Two of the patients responded well to treatment. One was first treated for meningitis (caused by unidentified Pseudomonas), but then developed endocarditis with blood cultures growing Staphylococcus aureus and C. jadinii.  Sharma and Chauhan (2020) report a case of osteomyelitis (bone infection) by C. jadinii in a 9‐month old boy, who was immunosuppressed. However, the species identification is uncertain since no information was provided about which methods were used.  The reports on C. jadinii did not add any new information that would change the current QPS status of this species.  Debaryomyces hansenii  The anamorph name of D. hansenii is Candida famata.  One reference related to possible concerns for human safety was identified. Sakamoto et al. (2021) reported that five (3.3%) of the ‘Candida’ isolates from the blood of hospitalised patients with underlying disease or other predisposing conditions in a hospital in Japan were D. hansenii. However, species identification was only by standard biochemical growth test and is therefore very uncertain.  The report on D. hansenii did not add any new information that would change the current QPS status of this species.  Hanseniaspora uvarum  The anamorph name of H. uvarum is Kloeckera apiculata.  One reference related to possible concerns for human safety was identified. Sanchez‐Cardenas et al. (2021) reported onychomycosis (nail infection) with H. uvarum in a woman with multiple sclerosis, but the species identification is not definite, since standard CHROMagar showed Candida glabrata and MALDI‐TOF MS suggested H. uvarum. No molecular confirmation was performed.  The report on H. uvarum did not add any new information that would change the current QPS status of this species.  Kluyveromyces marxianus  The anamorph name of K. marxianus is Candida kefyr.  Three publications contribute with information related to human safety concerns, and all three present identification problems (Singh et al., 2020; Jain et al., 2021,; Zyrek, 2021). Singh et al. (2020) claim that 2 clinical isolates from patients with suspected candidiasis in a hospital in India were Candida kefyr. Since the species identification is very uncertain and the paper lacks information regarding any predisposing conditions in the patients, the importance of the results cannot be appropriately assessed. Zyrek et al. (2021) provided no relevant information about this species.  The papers did not identify any information that would change the QPS status of K. marxianus.  Saccharomyces cerevisiae  The anamorph form of S. cerevisiae is not described. A synonym of this species is Saccharomyces boulardii.  Five publications reported safety concerns for humans and in four of them, the identification is uncertain. Four of them published fungaemia cases linked to the use of S. boulardii as a probiotic. Pinto et al., (2021) described a case of a fungal infection caused by S. cerevisiae in a critically ill COVID‐19 patient in an intensive care unit (ICU) after supplementation with Saccharomyces. Rannikko et al. (2021) also reported fungaemia cases linked to the use of S. boulardii probiotic in Finland hospitals from 2009 to 2018. Wombwell et al., (2021) report a retrospective study of 16.404 hospitalised patients in a medical care centre in the US. All subjects received S. boulardii as a preventative probiotic and were investigated for S. cerevisiae/S. boulardii in blood. Even though the subjects were hospitalised with underlying disease or trauma, and the majority of the patients admitted to intensive care had a central catheter, the fungaemia incidence was very low (0.1%). D'Agostin et al. (2021) make a systematic review of fungal infections due to intake of S. boulardii as a probiotic. Each of the 14 patients in the cited studies reporting infection with S. boulardii had underlying conditions.  Imre et al., (2021) compared the general phenotypic and virulence factors of 14 S. boulardii isolates, four from probiotic products and 10 clinical isolates, of which two were from patients diagnosed with mycosis. The authors conclude that some strains in probiotic products possess features that enable them to act as pathogens when conditions are permissive, and whether they can enter the bloodstream is mainly due to factors related to the host.  These new reports of S. cerevisiae did not add any new information that indicates change in the current QPS status of this species. The current QPS status of S. cerevisiae is not changed.  Wickerhamomyces anomalus  The anamorph name of W. anomalus is Candida pelliculosa.  Four references related to possible concerns for human safety were identified: Zhang et al. (2021), Yasuj et al. (2021), Koutserimpas et al. (2021), Yang (2021).  Zhang et al. (2021) reported 13 cases of W. anomalus fungaemia (positive blood cultures) in a 2.5‐year retrospective study in a hospital in China. Identification was by MALDI‐TOF MS but no further molecular confirmation was provided. All patients were hospitalised and had underlying disease and/or other predisposing conditions. There are uncertainties regarding W. anomalus as the etiological agent, since eight of the 13 subjects had mixed bacterial/Candida infection and four mixed candidemia. The isolates´ susceptibility to azoles were comparatively low and other classes of antimycotics were therefore recommended for treatment.  In a retrospective study in a hospital in Iran (2016–2019), blood samples were taken from 800 patients (Yasuj et al., 2021). One of the 27 with confirmed candidemia (in intensive care unit because of urinary tract infection with unknown agent) showed growth of W. anomalus. The isolate was susceptible to all tested antimycotics (fluconazole, amphotericin B and caspofungin).  Koutserimpas et al. (2021) reviewed reports of ‘non‐Candida’ opportunistic infections after prosthetic joint arthroplasty. Out of the 42 retrieved cases globally for the period 1981–2018, five were W. anomalus. A thorough evaluation of the implications of this review cannot be performed since no details are provided regarding identification methods.  W. anomalus has occasionally caused nosocomial outbreaks of opportunistic infections in neonatal intensive care units. Yang et al. (2021) provides two additional cases of fungaemia in 2012 and 2013 in a hospital in China. All isolates were susceptible to all five tested antimycotic substances and infections were successfully treated.  The literature update did not identify any information that would change the current QPS status of W. anomalus.  3.3.5  Protists  Aurantiochytrium limacinum  A search for papers potentially relevant for A. limacinum provided 22 articles. The analysis of their titles left 1 article, but this paper did not reach the full article evaluation stage, thus no new safety concern was identified. Therefore, the current QPS status of A. limacinum is not changed.  3.3.6  Algae  A search for papers potentially relevant for algae provided 240 articles. The analysis of their titles left 17 articles and for 4 of these the full text was analysed.  Euglena gracilis  No article dealt with potential safety concerns of E. gracilis. Therefore, the current QPS status of E. gracilis is not changed.  Haematococcus lacustris synonym Haematococcus pluvialis  No article dealt with potential safety concerns of H. lacustris. Therefore, the current QPS status of H. lacustris is not changed.  Tetraselmis chuii  No article dealt with potential safety concerns of T. chuii. Therefore, the current QPS status of T. chuii is not changed.  3.3.7  Viruses used for plant protection  Alphaflexiviridae and Potyviridae  A search for papers potentially relevant for the QPS evaluation of viruses of the Alphaflexiviridae and Potyviridae provided 55 references. After title screening, no paper reached the title/abstract screening stage, thus no new safety concern was identified. Therefore, the current QPS status remains unchanged.  Baculoviridae  A search for papers potentially relevant for the QPS evaluation of Baculoviridae provided 59 references. Two articles dealing with Baculoviridae passed the title screening but did not reach the full article evaluation stage, thus no new safety concern was identified. Therefore, the current QPS status remains unchanged.  ",TRUE,TRUE,

ToR 2: Review taxonomic units previously recommended for the QPS list and their qualifications when new information has become available:  •In relation to the results of the monitoring of possible new safety concerns relevant for the QPS list, there were no results that would justify removal of any TUs from the QPS list.  ToR 3: (Re)assess the suitability of taxonomic units notified to EFSA not present in the current QPS list for their inclusion in that list:  •Out of the 50 notifications received between October 2021 and March 2022, 25 were related to TUs that already had QPS status and therefore did not require further evaluation.•Of the remaining 25 notifications, 16 notifications were related to microorganisms that are excluded from QPS evaluation (10 were notifications of filamentous fungi, 1 of Clostridium butyricum (bacterium), 1 of Enterococcus faecium (bacterium), 3 of Escherichia coli (bacterium), 1 of Streptomyces sp. (bacterium).•Nine of the 50 notifications received, corresponding to 7 TUs, were evaluated for possible QPS status: four of these (Companilactobacillus formosensis, Pseudonocardia autotrophica, Streptococcus salivarius and Papiliotrema terrestris) being evaluated for the first time. The other three, Ensifer adhaerens, Microbacterium foliorum and Pseudomonas fluorescens were re‐assessed because an update was requested in relation to the current mandate. The following conclusions were drawn:  ○  Companilactobacillus formosensis (previously known as Lactobacillus formosensis) is not recommended for the QPS list due to lack of body of knowledge for its occurrence in the food and feed chain.○  Ensifer adhaerens (synonym Sinorhizobium adhaerens) is not recommended for the QPS list due to lack of body of knowledge for its occurrence in the food and feed chain.○  Microbacterium foliorum is not recommended for the QPS list due to lack of body of knowledge for its occurrence in the food and feed chain.○  Pseudonocardia autotrophica is not recommended for the QPS list due to lack of body of knowledge and uncertainty on the safety of biologically active compounds which can be produced.○  Pseudomonas fluorescens is not recommended for the QPS list due to possible safety concerns.○  Papiliotrema. terrestris is not recommended for the QPS list due to a limited body knowledge.○  Streptococcus salivarius is not recommended for the QPS list due to its ability to cause bacteraemia and systemic infection that results in a variety of morbidities.

PMC9310698,Data and methodologies,Other,AP009493,0,0,0,,,"  2  Data and methodologies  2.1  Data  In reply to ToR 3, (re)assessment of the suitability of TUs notified within the time period covered by this Statement (from October 2021 to March 2022, inclusive) was carried out. The literature review considered the information on taxonomy, the body of knowledge, the potential safety concerns related to human and animal health and to the environment (EFSA BIOHAZ Panel, 2020a) for each TU. The environmental risk assessment of plant protection products is not included in the QPS assessment but is carried out by the Pesticide Peer Review (PPR) Unit based on the risk assessment in the application. Information on relevant acquired antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is reflected in the safety sections.  Relevant databases, such as PubMed, Web of Science, CAB Abstracts or Food Science Technology Abstracts (FSTA) and Scopus, were searched, based on the judgement of the experts. To complete the assessment an ELS‐based approach may have been applied. In the current Panel Statement, this ELS approach was applied for assessing the QPS status of Ensifer adhaerens and Streptococcus salivarius. The ELS followed the same methodology as used for monitoring new safety concerns related to species with QPS status. More details on the search strategy, search keys, and approach for each of the assessments are described in Appendix A. Only the literature that is considered, based on expert judgement, to be relevant for the QPS assessment is reflected in the Statement.  Only valid TUs covered by the relevant international committees on the nomenclature for microorganisms are considered for the QPS assessment.  2.2  Methodologies  2.2.1  Evaluation of a QPS recommendation for taxonomic units notified to EFSA  In response to ToR 1, the EFSA Units were asked to update the list of microbiological agents being notified to EFSA. A total of 50 notifications were received between October 2021 and March 2022, of which 35 were for evaluation for use in feed, 11 for use as food enzymes, food additives and flavourings, 4 as novel foods and 0 as plant protection products (Table 1).

(b)  Nine notifications corresponding to seven TUs, four of these (Companilactobacillus formosensis, Pseudonocardia autotrophica, Streptococcus salivarius, and Papiliotrema terrestris) being evaluated for the first time. The other three, Ensifer adhaerens, Microbacterium foliorum and Pseudomonas fluorescens were re‐assessed because an update was requested in the current mandate.  In response to ToR 3, nine of the 50 notifications, corresponding to seven TUs, were evaluated for possible QPS status, four of these, Companilactobacillus formosensis, Pseudonocardia autotrophica, Streptococcus salivarius, and Papiliotrema terrestris, being evaluated for the first time. The other three, Ensifer adhaerens, Microbacterium foliorum and Pseudomonas fluorescens, were re‐assessed because an update was requested in the current mandate. The remaining 41 notifications were excluded from QPS evaluation for the following reasons: 17 notifications were related to microorganisms that are excluded from QPS evaluation (10 were notifications of filamentous fungi, 1 of Clostridium butyricum (bacterium), 1 of Enterococcus faecium (bacterium), 3 of Escherichia coli, 1 Streptomyces spp.) and 25 were related to TUs that already had QPS status and did not require further evaluation in this mandate.  2.2.2  Monitoring of new safety concerns related to species with QPS status  In reply to ToR 2, concerning the revision of the TUs previously recommended for the QPS list and their qualifications, an extensive literature search (ELS) was conducted as described in Appendix B – ELS protocol, see https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3607188, and in Appendix C Search strategies – see https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3607192, respectively.  The artificial intelligence (AI) function of DistillerSR was used for pre‐screening of papers for Bifidobacterium spp., lactobacilli, Lactococcus lactis, Bacillus spp. and yeasts, followed by a second screening of those articles carried out by two experts.  The aim of the ELS was to identify any publicly available scientific studies reporting on safety concerns for humans, animals or the environment, caused by QPS organisms since the previous QPS review (i.e. publications from July to December 2021).  For case reports of human infections or intoxications, important additional information includes whether any negative impacts are confined to persons with conditions favouring opportunistic infections, for example immunosuppression, and whether transmission occurred through food or other routes, when described (e.g. medical devices). Studies indicating the presence of virulence factors (e.g. toxins and enzymes that may contribute to the pathogenicity of the microorganism) in the TU are also reported as relevant when identifying potential safety concerns.  Several of the QPS‐TUs are sporadically reported as causing infections in individuals with recognised predisposing conditions for the acquisition of opportunistic infections, e.g. cardiovascular conditions associated with endocarditis, people in the lower or upper age spectrum, or with other conditions which can lead to impairment of the immunological system, such as patients subjected to transplants, undergoing cancer therapy, suffering from physical trauma or tissue damage, or HIV patients. Moreover, gastrointestinal tract‐related conditions with, for example mucosal impairment and/or proton pump inhibitors can also be predisposing factors for infection. Previous use of the microorganisms being assessed as food supplements for humans was reported in many of these cases. Nevertheless, the QPS assessment takes into consideration these reports, extracting relevant information whenever justified. For a detailed protocol of the process and search strategies, refer to Appendices B and C.  After removal of duplicates, 3,290 records were submitted to the title screening step, which led to the exclusion of 3,143 of these. The remaining 190 records were found eligible for the title and abstract screening step, which led to the exclusion of 66 of these. Of the 55 articles that finally reached the article evaluation step (full text), 32 were considered to report a potential safety concern and were further analysed.  The flow of records from their identification by the different search strategies (as reported in Appendix C) to their consideration as potentially relevant papers for QPS is shown in Table 2.

PMC9310698,Introduction,Introduction,AP009493,0,0,0,,,"  1  Introduction  The qualified presumption of safety (QPS) approach was developed by the EFSA Scientific Committee to provide a generic concept for risk assessment within the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) for microorganisms intentionally introduced into the food chain, in support of the respective Scientific Panels and Units in the context of market authorisations for their use in food and feed and requiring an EFSA safety assessment (EFSA, 2007). The list, first established in 2007, has been continuously revised and updated. A Panel Statement is published approximately every 6 months. These Panel Statements include the results of the assessment of relevant new papers related to the TUs with QPS status. They also contain the assessment of newly submitted TUs to the EFSA Units on Feed, Food Ingredients and Packaging (FIP), Nutrition, Pesticides and Genetically Modified Organisms (GMO). After 3 years, a QPS opinion is published summarising the results of the Panel Statements published in that period.  1.1  Background and Terms of Reference as provided by EFSA  A wide variety of microorganisms are intentionally added at different stages of the food and feed chains. In the context of applications for market authorisation of these microbiological agents used, either directly or as sources of food and feed additives, food enzymes and plant protection products, EFSA is requested to assess their safety.  EFSA's work on QPS activities began in 2004 when the Scientific Committee issued a scientific opinion in continuation of the 2003 working document ‘On a generic approach to the safety assessment of microorganisms used in feed/food and feed/food production’ prepared by a working group consisting of members of the former Scientific Committee on Animal Nutrition, the Scientific Committee on Food and the Scientific Committee on Plants of the European Commission.  1   The document, made available for public consultation, proposed the introduction of the concept of Qualified Presumption of Safety (QPS), to be applied to selected groups of microorganisms. Microorganisms not considered suitable for QPS status would remain subject to a full safety assessment. EFSA management asked its Scientific Committee to consider whether the QPS approach could be applied to the safety assessment of microorganisms across the various EFSA Scientific Panels. In doing so, the Committee was required to take into account the response of the stakeholders to the QPS approach. In its 2005 opinion (EFSA, 2005), the Scientific Committee concluded that the QPS approach could provide a generic assessment system that could be applied to all requests received by EFSA for the safety assessments of microorganisms deliberately introduced into the food and feed chain. Its introduction was intended to improve transparency and ensure consistency in the approach used across the EFSA Panels. Applications involving a taxonomic unit belonging to a species that falls within a QPS group do not require a full safety assessment.  Several taxonomic units (usually species for bacteria and yeasts; families for viruses) have been included in the QPS list, either following notifications to EFSA, or proposals made initially by stakeholders during a public consultation in 2005, even if they were not yet notified to EFSA (EFSA, 2005). The EFSA Scientific Committee reviewed the range and numbers of microorganisms likely to be the subject of an EFSA Opinion and, in 2007, published a list of microorganisms recommended for the QPS list.  In their 2007 opinion (EFSA, 2007), the Scientific Committee recommended that a QPS approach should provide a generic concept to prioritise and to harmonise safety risk assessment of microorganisms intentionally introduced into the food chain, in support of the respective Scientific Panels and EFSA Units in the frame of the market authorisations for their use in the food and feed chain. The same Committee recognised that there would have to be continuing provision for reviewing and modifying the QPS list and, in line with this recommendation, the EFSA Panel on Biological Hazards (BIOHAZ) took the prime responsibility for this and started reviewing annually the existing QPS list. In 2008, the first annual QPS update was published (EFSA, 2008).  In 2014, the BIOHAZ Panel, in consultation with the Scientific Committee, decided to change the revision procedure; the overall assessment of the taxonomic units previously recommended for the QPS list (EFSA BIOHAZ Panel, 2013) was no longer carried out annually but over a 3‐year period. From 2017, the search and revision of the possible safety concerns linked to those taxonomic units began instead to be carried out every 6 months through extensive literature searches (ELS). The update of the 2013 QPS list (EFSA BIOHAZ Panel, 2013) was done in 2016 (EFSA BIOHAZ Panel, 2017). From 2016 on, the QPS list (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1146566) and the list of notifications to EFSA (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3607183) are constantly updated, independent of the QPS opinion, and are available at the Knowledge Junction in Zenodo. The most recent QPS opinion (EFSA BIOHAZ Panel, 2020a) summarises the main results of the 3‐year ELS on the QPS TUs, together with an update of the process for granting QPS status. In the meantime, every 6 months a Panel Statement, compiling the assessments for a QPS status of the microbiological agents notified to EFSA requested by the Feed Unit, the Food Ingredients and Packaging (FIP) Unit, the Nutrition Unit, the Pesticides Unit and the Genetically Modified Organisms (GMO) Unit, as well as the summary of each 6‐month ELS exercise, has been produced and published. Each QPS Panel Statement contains the evaluations of the new notifications for microorganisms submitted for possible QPS status. It also contains the result of a standardised extensive literature search performed every 6 months regarding possible new safety concerns related to the TUs already included in the QPS list. The data identified are used to inform decisions on whether any TU may or may not remain on the QPS list, and whether any qualifications need to be revised.  Establishing a QPS status is based on four pillars: [1] the taxonomic grouping (TU) for which QPS is sought (‘taxonomic identification’); [2] whether sufficient relevant information is available about the proposed group of organisms to conclude on human/animal exposure via food/ feed (‘body of knowledge’); [3] whether the grouping proposed contains known ‘safety concerns’ and, finally, [4] the intended end use (‘intended use’). If a hazard related to a TU is identified, which can be tested at the strain or product level, a ‘qualification’ to exclude that hazard may be established and added. The subject of these qualifications for the microbial strain under investigation is evaluated by the EFSA Unit to which the application dossier has been allocated. Absence of acquired genes coding for resistance to antimicrobials relevant for humans and animals is a generic qualification for all bacterial TUs; the absence of antimycotic resistance should be proven if the pertinent yeasts are to be used as viable organisms in the food or feed chains. The qualification ‘for production purpose only’ implies the absence of viable cells of the production organism in the final product and can also be applied to food and feed products based on microbial biomass (EFSA BIOHAZ Panel, 2020a).  Because the QPS evaluation is, after its initial creation, only triggered through an application dossier notified to EFSA, the QPS list is not exhaustive.  In summary, the QPS evaluation provides a generic safety pre‐assessment approach for use within EFSA that covers safety concerns for humans, animals and the environment. In the QPS concept, a safety assessment of a defined taxonomic unit is performed independently of the legal framework under which the application is made in the course of an authorisation process. Although general human safety is part of the evaluation, specific issues relating to type and level of exposure of users handling the product (e.g. dermal contact, inhalation, ingestion) are not addressed. In the case of Genetically Modified Microorganisms (GMM) for which the species of the recipient strain qualifies for the QPS status, and for which the genetically modified state does not give rise to safety concerns, the QPS approach can be extended to genetically modified production strains (EFSA BIOHAZ Panel, 2018). The assessment of potential allergenic microbial residual components is beyond the QPS remit; however, if there is science‐based evidence for a microbial species it is reported. These aspects are separately assessed, where applicable, by the EFSA Panel responsible for assessing the application.  The lowest TU for which the QPS status is granted is the species level for bacteria, yeasts and protists/algae, and family for viruses.  Filamentous fungi, bacteriophages, Streptomycetes, Oomycetes, Enterococcus faecium, Escherichia coli and recently also Clostridium butyricum (EFSA BIOHAZ Panel, 2020a,b) are excluded from the QPS assessments based on an ambiguous taxonomic position or the possession of potentially harmful traits by some strains of the taxonomic unit, therefore requiring a specific assessment for each strain for which an application is made.  The Terms of Reference are as follows:  ToR 1: Keep updated the list of microbiological agents being notified in the context of a technical dossier to EFSA Units such as Feed, Pesticides, Food Ingredients and Packaging (FIP) and Nutrition, for intentional use directly or as sources of food and feed additives, food enzymes and plant protection products for safety assessment.  ToR 2: Review taxonomic units previously recommended for the QPS list and their qualifications when new information has become available. The latter is based on a review of the updated literature aiming to verify whether any new safety concern has arisen that could require the removal of a taxonomic unit from the list, and to verify if the qualifications still effectively exclude safety concerns.  ToR 3: (Re) assess the suitability of new taxonomic units notified to EFSA for their inclusion in the QPS list. These microbiological agents are notified to EFSA and requested by the Feed Unit, the FIP Unit, the Nutrition Unit or by the Pesticides Unit.  ",FALSE,TRUE,

PMC9310698,Summary,Other,AP009493,0,0,0,,,"  Summary  The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) asked the Panel on Biological Hazards (BIOHAZ) to deliver a Scientific Opinion on the maintenance of the qualified presumption of safety (QPS) list. The QPS list contains microorganisms, intentionally added to food and feed, which have achieved QPS status. The request included three specific tasks as mentioned in the Terms of Reference (ToRs).  The QPS process was developed to provide a harmonised generic pre‐evaluation procedure to support safety risk assessments of microorganisms performed by EFSA’s scientific Panels and Units. This process assesses the taxonomic identity, body of relevant knowledge and safety of microorganisms. Safety concerns identified for a taxonomic unit (TU) are, where possible, confirmed at strain or product level, reflected as ‘qualifications’ that should be assessed at the strain level by EFSA’s Scientific Panels. A generic qualification for all QPS bacterial TUs applies in relation to the absence of acquired genes conferring resistance to clinically relevant antimicrobials (EFSA, 2008).  The list of microorganisms is maintained and re‐evaluated approximately every 6 months in a Panel Statement. The Panel Statement also includes the evaluation of microbiological agents newly notified to EFSA within the previous 6‐month period.  The first ToR requires ongoing updates of the list of microbiological agents notified to EFSA, in the context of a technical dossier for safety assessment. The overall list (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3607183) was updated with the notifications received between October 2021 and March 2022. Within this period, 50 notifications were received by EFSA, of which 35 were proposed for evaluation in feed, 11 for use as food enzymes, food additives and flavourings and 4 as novel foods. The new notifications received between October 2021 and March 2022 are included in the current Statement (see Appendix F).  The second ToR concerns the revision of the TUs previously recommended for the QPS list and their qualifications. For this revision, articles published from July and December 2021 were assessed. The articles were retrieved and assessed through an extensive literature search (ELS) protocol available in Appendix B (see https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3607188) and the search strategies in Appendix C (see https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3607192). No new information was found that would affect the QPS status of those TUs or their qualifications.  The third ToR requires a (re)assessment of new TUs notified to EFSA, for their suitability for inclusion in the updated QPS list at the Knowledge Junction in Zenodo (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1146566, Appendix E – the link opens at the latest version of the QPS list, and also shows the versions associated to each Panel Statement).  Fifty notifications were received; 41 of these were not evaluated for the following reasons: 16 notifications were related to microorganisms that are excluded from QPS evaluation (10 were notifications of filamentous fungi, 1 Enterococcus faecium, 1 of Clostridium butyricum, 3 of Escherichia coli, 1 Streptomyces spp.), and 25 were related to TUs that already have QPS status and did not require further evaluation.  The remaining nine notifications, corresponding to seven TUs, were evaluated for possible QPS status: four of these (Companilactobacillus formosensis, Pseudonocardia autotrophica, Streptococcus salivarius and Papiliotrema terrestris) being evaluated for the first time. The other three, Ensifer adhaerens, Microbacterium foliorum and Pseudomonas fluorescens were re‐assessed because an update was requested in relation to the current mandate.  The following conclusions were drawn:  •  Companilactobacillus formosensis (previously known as Lactobacillus formosensis) is not recommended for the QPS list due to lack of body of knowledge for its occurrence in the food and feed chain.•  Pseudonocardia autotrophica is not recommended for the QPS list due to lack of body of knowledge and uncertainty on the safety of biologically active compounds which can be produced.•  Streptococcus salivarius is not recommended for the QPS list due to its ability to cause bacteraemia and systemic infection that results in a variety of morbidities.•  Papiliotrema terrestris is not recommended for the QPS list due to a limited body of knowledge.•  Ensifer adhaerens (synonym Sinorhizobium adhaerens) is not recommended for the QPS list due to lack of body of knowledge for its occurrence in the food and feed chain.•  Microbacterium foliorum is not recommended for the QPS list due to lack of body of knowledge for its occurrence in the food and feed chain.•  Pseudomonas fluorescens is not recommended for the QPS list due to possible safety concerns.
