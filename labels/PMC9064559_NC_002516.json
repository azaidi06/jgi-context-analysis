The PCR analysis identified sequences encoding specific cancer-adjacent therapeutic enzymes in the bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa AR01. The genome of P. aeruginosa PAO1 was chosen for this purpose because the authors found via a NCBI database search that this organism was both closely related to the AR01 strain and contained a high frequency of gene clusters encoding therapeutic enzymes of interest."
